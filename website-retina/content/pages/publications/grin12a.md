We have developed a comprehensive workstation with a user friendly interface for the analysis of color fundus images. This workstation gathers the output of several computer-aided diagnosis modules for fundus image processing. These modules include algorithms to automatically segment vessels1, to detect anatomical structures like the optic disk and fovea location2, and to automatically detect different kind of lesions3. The workstation allows the quantitative analysis of retinal lesions and structures which can help in the diagnosis and quantification of major eye diseases including Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Glaucoma. In addition to overlays highlighting individual lesion, quantitative measurements are collected in structured reports similar to the ones used in clinical practice. In the future, the workstation will be integrated into a publicly available web-based system. This way, research groups will be able to test the system on their own data sets in order to allow a comparison with their own developed software. This approach provides a new methodology for evaluating and comparing computer-aided diagnosis systems without the need to make code or executables publicly available and without being bound by the use of public data sets or by the performance measurements currently proposed in challenges.
