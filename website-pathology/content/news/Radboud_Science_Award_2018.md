In addition to recognizing excellent research, this award aims at connecting academic research to primary school teaching programs. Prior to and during the award ceremony, the winners were asked critical questions by the students of the participating primary schools. In the coming year, the winners will work on the development of teaching material together with their colleagues, the [Radboud Wetenschapsknooppunt](https://www.ru.nl/wetenschapsknooppunt/) and teachers.
