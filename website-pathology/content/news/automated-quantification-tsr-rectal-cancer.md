Tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) serves as an independent prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. The recent introduction of digital pathology in routine tissue diagnostics holds opportunities for automated TSR analysis. [member/oscar-geessink] and colleagues investigated the potential of computer-aided quantification of intratumoral stroma in rectal cancer whole-slide images. Hot-spots inside histopathological slides of 129 rectal adenocarcinoma patients were visually assessed for TSR by two experts. A semi-automatic method based on deep learning was trained to segment all relevant tissue types in rectal cancer histology and subsequently applied to the hot-spots provided by the experts. Patients were assigned to a ‘stroma-high’ or ‘stroma-low’ group by both TSR methods (visual and automated). With stroma-low as baseline, automated TSR was found to be prognostic independent of age, gender, pT-stage, lymph node status, tumor grade, and whether adjuvant therapy was given, both for disease-specific survival (hazard ratio = 2.48 (95% confidence interval 1.29–4.78)) and for disease-free survival (hazard ratio = 2.05 (95% confidence interval 1.11–3.78)). Visually assessed TSR did not serve as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis.
