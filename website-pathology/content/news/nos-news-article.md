Jeroen van der Laak has contributed to a <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2161091-computer-kan-kanker-beter-herkennen-dan-patholoog.html"> news article</a> from NOS about the success of Google's deep learning-based algorithm for the automatic detection of breast cancer metastasis in sentinel lymphnodes. The algorithm was trained using data from the grand challenge CAMELYON16, organized by members of the CP group. The algorithm outperfoms pathologists as decribed in the resulting <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02442"> paper</a>.
