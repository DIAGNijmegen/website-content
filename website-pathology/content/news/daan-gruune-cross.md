The [‘Gruune Cross’](https://gruunecross.nl/) is a 60 kilometer long bike ride through the beautiful Achterhoek organized by Lions Doetinchem De Graafschap. 
On the 1st of July 2022, nearly [100 people](https://gruunecross.nl/fietsers/) have committed themselves to cycling together to raise money for important cancer research, including the research of [member/daan-geijs].
Together with the cyclists and sponsors a total amount of €53.320 was raised. 

[Daan's research](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/projects/deep-derma/) focuses on the clinical implementation of automated skin cancer decision making. He uses end-to-end learning to decide if a whole-slide-image contains basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and its subtype. After the excision of the BCC, done by the dermatologist, a semantic segmentation model checks if the cutting margins are free of tumor.

[member/daan-geijs] and his team led by [member/geert-litjens] would like to thank ‘Stichting Lions Share Doetinchem De Graafschap’ and everyone who contributed in any way to the success.
