## Call for internship proposals
Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds tremendous potential to transform healthcare — from improving diagnostics and treatment planning to optimizing workflows and enabling more personalized patient care. To help turn this potential into practical impact, the Radboud Technology Center (RTC) AI invites project proposals for AI internships focused on real-world healthcare applications at Radboudumc.

These internships are intended for AI Master’s students who will work on clinically relevant problems under the joint supervision of RTC AI experts and clinical researchers. Clinicians and researchers without prior AI expertise are especially encouraged to apply, as the technical supervision will be provided by RTC AI specialists.

To be eligible, proposed projects must meet the following criteria:

- Project proposals can only be submitted by Radboudumc employees.
- Each project must include a clinical supervisor who will provide domain-specific guidance.
- All required data (including labels and annotations) must already be collected and accessible at the time of proposal submission.
- The proposal must describe a specific, well-defined clinical or healthcare problem to be addressed using AI methods.


## Examples of Suitable Projects
- Automating or improving diagnostic workflows  
- Predictive modeling for patient outcomes  
- Image or signal analysis for clinical data  
- Natural language processing for clinical reports  
- Decision support tools for personalized care
