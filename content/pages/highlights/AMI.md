Last week, the final meeting of the Automation in Medical Imaging (<a href=”https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/projects/ami/>AMI</a>)-project took place at the Radiology department of <a href=”https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/patient-care”>Radboud University Medical Center</a>. The AMI-project was a close collaborative project between the <a href=”http://www.diagnijmegen.nl/index.php/Home”>Diagnostic Image Analysis Group</a> and the <a href=”https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de/”>Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Medicine MEVIS</a>. The aim of AMI was to develop a generic platform for automatic medical image analysis. Deep learning-based algorithms have successfully been developed for the automated analysis and <a href=”http://histokat-demo.mevis.fraunhofer.de/”>registration</a> of <a href=”https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29512516”>chest CTs</a>, <a href=”https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5695961”/>ophthalmology images</a> and <a href=”https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8447230>histological whole slide images</a>. The web-based viewing system, specifically developed for, but not restricted to this project, offers support for multiple radiology, ophthalmology and pathology image formats. The AMI-project was funded by the <a href=”https://www.ru.nl/”>Radboud University</a>, <a href=”https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/patient-care”>Radboud University Medical Center<a/> and the <a href=”https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de/”>Fraunhofer Gesellschaft</a> as an ICON-project, focusing on collaborative, interdisciplinary and international research.
