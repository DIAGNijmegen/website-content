description: A large number of AI products are now on the market. How should AI be implemented in radiology practice? 
bibkeys: 

Over one hundred CE certified products based on artificial intelligence for radiology are now for sale. This research project focuses on the questions how radiology departments can obtain an overview of the available products, how to best evaluate these products in terms of different aspects, from technical performance to cost-effectiveness and societal benefit, and how to implement AI in the radiology practice.

We have made a website available that lists all products: [AI for Radiology](https://grand-challenge.org/aiforradiology/). We have performed the first cost-effectiveness analyses of AI tools for radiology and have started several studies to assess the performance of AI tools. Together with the Dutch Radiology Society, we are building a network of radiologists interested in the implementation of AI and we create practical guidelines on how to procure and implement AI tools in the daily workflow of a radiology department.
