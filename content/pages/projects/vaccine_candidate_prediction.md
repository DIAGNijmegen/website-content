## Clinical Problem 
Deeper understanding of the immune system’s intricacies has led to clinical
breakthroughs of personalized cancer vaccines in eliminating tumors in advanced-stage
cancer patients. Formulated with fragments from a patient’s tumor DNA, cancer
vaccines train a patient’s own immune system to recognize a patient’s mutated cancer
proteins as ‘foreign’ and wage a lethal attack against tumors. The major puzzle in this field is: which of a patient’s hundreds of tumor mutations can trigger the immune system to attack tumors? Complementary to costly and timeconsuming wet-lab screenings (e.g., Sipuleucel-T was priced at $93,0005), predictive algorithms that can quickly pinpoint neoantigens from a patient’s tumor DNA are
urgently needed, if personalized cancer vaccines are to be applied on a large scale.
We aim to predict cancer vaccine candidates in this project. Our overall aim is to
improve the efficacy, safety and development time of existing T cell based cancer
vaccine approaches.
