## Background
Healthcare costs are globally rising. The workload of radiology departments has substantially increased and is still increasing, and, as a result, radiologists are under large pressure and risk of burn-out. The imminent implementation of lung cancer screening and the rapid increase in the availability of novel cancer treatments such as immunotherapy will result in a continued increase of imaging. 

## Mission and aims
[MERAI Lab](https://icai.ai/icai-labs/merai/) is a collaboration between Radboudumc and MeVis Medical Solutions with the mission to create world-leading AI-supported software solutions for healthcare.  We aim to create AI solutions in the lung oncology field that will improve the accuracy in the interpretation of the increasing amount of imaging that is performed for screening, optimal treatment selection and treatment monitoring, and reduce the time needed to report these scans. Both combined will improve the cost-effectiveness of our healthcare system. For responsible use of the developed AI algorithms, it is essential that we guarantee robust and trustworthy AI solutions that reach performance close to human experts.
