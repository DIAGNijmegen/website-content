description: Strengthening the screening of lung cancer in Europe

## SOLACE vision and general objectives
The SOLACE vision is to ensure the implementation and optimization of effective, advanced state-of-the-art lung cancer screening programs in EU member states. As there is no “one size fits all” solution, SOLACE will provide a modular framework (toolbox) for individualised approaches for lung cancer screening on a national or regional level. This will empower programmes to increase participation of at-risk populations, improve life expectancy and quality of life even further, increase benefits and reduce harms while being high-quality and highly cost-efficient. The focus of our mission is to develop, test and disseminate tools to help overcome identified bottlenecks and specifically address the health inequalities in different European countries.
