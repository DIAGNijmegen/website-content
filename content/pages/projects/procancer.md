## Background

In Europe, prostate cancer (PC) is the second most frequent type of cancer in men and the third most lethal. Current clinical practices lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, necessitating more effective tools for discriminating between aggressive and non-aggressive disease. The EU-funded ProCAncer-I project proposes to develop advanced artificial intelligence models to address unmet clinical needs: diagnosis, metastases detection and prediction of response to treatment. To achieve this, partners will generate a large interoperable repository of health images, and a scalable high performance computing platform hosting the largest collection of PC Magnetic Resonance Images used for developing robust PC AI models. To ensure the rapid clinical implementation of the models developed, the project's partners will robustly monitor performance, accuracy and reproducibility.
