## Background
Lung cancer is increasingly being detected at early stages. Although small tumor size associates with increased likelihood of curative resection, 5-year overall survival is only 63% and 44% for stage I and II respectively. Although local and systemic adjuvant treatments are available, these are effective in only a subsets of patients and come with side-effects.

## Aim
This project aims to improve prognostication of early stage non-small cell lung cancer based on pre-operative imaging that will enable clinicians to personalize treatment to patients’ individual characteristics. We hypothesize that the incorporation of metabolic features derived from <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT, advanced quantitative features derived from CT, and additional molecular and morphological features from pathology have superior prognostic impact to conventional staging to predict time and/or localisation of disease recurrence. This will increase efficacy and minimize exposure to potential side effects. Furthermore, it enables better patient counselling, which is critical for shared decision making.

## Funding
This project has received funding from [Stichting Bergh in 't Zadel](https://berghinhetzadel.nl/) and [Radboud Oncologie Fonds](https://radboudoncologiefonds.nl/).
