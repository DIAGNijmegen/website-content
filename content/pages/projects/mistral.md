## Problem description:
For mitigation strategies to be effective and efficient against COVID-19, they must be context-specific and take local conditions into account. In low- and middle-income countries, limited resources and fragile healthcare systems often dictate what is feasible.  The MistraL project, commencing in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic addresses the issue of early detection of COVID-19 in Lesotho, a lower-middle-income country with limitations on healthcare infrastructure and spending. Early detection of COVID-19 mitigates against high transmission rates, limiting the number of severe cases, which is of particular importance in countries with limited or no intensive care facilities.

## Project summary
 In this project, researchers combine artificial intelligence, portable chest X-ray machines and antigen-based diagnostic tests to enable and improve the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients in settings with limited resources.  The CAD4COVID AI system for detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest X-ray will be utilised along with point-of-care blood testing and antigen testing to determine the optimal methods for early detection of COVID-19.
