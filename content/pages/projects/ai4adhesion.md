description: We investigate whether AI can detect abdominal adhesions on cine MRI.
bibkeys: 

## Background

This project aims to improve outcomes in the 30,000 patients per year in the Netherlands that develop chronic pain after abdominal surgery. This pain is often caused by adhesions, tough bands of tissue that form between structures and organs in the abdomen. Medical consumption in these patients is high, 70% is under treatment of a gastroenterologist and one in three is opioid dependent. A recently developed imaging technique, cine MRI, can detect and localize these adhesions. This type of imaging can be used to make treatment decisions. Cine MRI is not widely used yet, because radiological reading is time-consuming and expertise-dependent. In this research project, we aim to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to create tools that realize clinical implementation of cine MRI for adhesion detection.

## Aim
Develop AI to improve adhesion detection on cine MRI.
