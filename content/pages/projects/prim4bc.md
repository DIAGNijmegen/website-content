## Background

Approximately 20% of
all breast cancers are so-called triple-negative (TNBC), indicating their lack
of overexpression of oestrogen and progesterone receptor and human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2. These cancers are associated with an increased risk
of recurrence, even for tumors smaller than one centimeter. There is a tendency to
administer adjuvant chemotherapy even to limited stage TNBC patients. This
results, however, in substantial overtreatment, accompanied by unnecessary
mortality, morbidity and costs. On the other site, approximately 25% of TNBC
patients will be faced with a locoregional or distant recurrence, usually within
4 years after initial diagnosis. Advanced TNBC has an extremely poor prognosis
with a median survival of only 13 months. Up to date, it is a priori unclear
which patients will get a recurrence. Prognostic biomarkers are therefore
urgently needed, enabling clinicians to select TNBC patients for adjuvant
chemotherapy who are at increased risk of recurrence.

Promising results were published on the prognostic value of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in
TNBC, using immunohistochemically (IHC) stained tissue sections. Also, mitotic
count was found to yield prognostic information. To date, assessment of these
biomarkers lack standardisation, resulting in large variations in published
results and hampering clinical implementation.

## Aim

In this project we
will apply advanced digital image analysis to obtain prognostic data from
H&E and IHC stained sections. Statistical techniques will subsequently be
used to derive a model offering the strongest possible prognostic data. The
model will be able to predict TNBC recurrence and survival within 5 years.
