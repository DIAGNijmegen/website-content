description: Project with focus on the extension of open-source software ASAP that includes functionality for study and case management.

This project is the successor of our [STITPRO I](https://diagnijmegen.github.io/website-pathology/projects/stitpro1/) project. In STITPRO I we developed the automated slide analysis platform [(ASAP)](https://diagnijmegen.github.io/website-pathology/software/asap/). STITPRO II will focus on extending this open-source software. We will include functionality for study and case management, allowing users to easily navigate through different images per patient and between patients. This will strongly add to the usability of the software for research projects and validation of developed algorithms in diagnostic routine. To realize the required functionality, a database back-end will be developed, as well as a GUI showing overviews of projects, patients and images. Also, the software will be equipped with a multiple-document interface, to enable comparison between different slides.
