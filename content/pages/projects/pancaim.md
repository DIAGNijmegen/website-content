## Background

This project aims to combine genomics and imaging phenomics using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate breakthrough knowledge to increase understanding of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) biology and patient stratification. Europe has the highest incidence of pancreatic cancer, with 150 000 new cases in 2018 and 95 000 deaths/year and worldwide, half a million deaths. The trend is that it will soon become the second leading cause of cancer-related death in Western societies. Potential new treatments are emerging, but the main challenge is to select the right drug for an individual patient. PANCAIM will develop trusted impactful AI applications for regular clinical use to help clinical decision-makers to give the right treatment to the right patients at the right time, and at the right cost and improve treatment outcomes of PDAC patients.

## Aim
PANCAIM will optimize and integrate genomics and imaging phenomics using artificial intelligence (AI)

## Funding
Horizon 2020
