It is difficult to predict what will happen in the long-term to somebody with traumatic brain injury (TBI) after a car or motorcycle crash, a fall, sports injuries or an assaults. TBI is common, it occurs to 2.5 million people each year in europe, and of those, 1 million are admitted to hospital and 75.000 die. TBI is the leading cause of death and disability in young adults and the incidence in elderly patients is increasing.

On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) it is possible to identify small bleedings, and it is hypothesized that the amount and location of such bleedings may be used as a prognostic markers. Delineating such lesions, and assigning them to a brain region, is a tedious and cumbersome process, and not done in routine practice. We are therefore developing AI tools to automatically perform this quantification.  

This project is part of a larger study, [CENTER-TBI](https://www.center-tbi.eu/).
