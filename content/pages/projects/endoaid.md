## Clinical problem

Endometrial cancer is one of the more frequent malignancies in women. An increased thickness of the endometrium and
abnormal vaginal blood loss are often the first signs of the development of endometrium cancer and early detection and
treatment of precancerous tissue (premalignancy) can prevent the ultimate development of cancer, thus preventing the
morbidity and mortality. However, only a small percentage of all biopsies (10%) demonstrate endometrial (pre)malignancy
and the majority is either benign or is non-informative and has to be sampled again. As the diagnostic evaluation of
mostly benign cases results in substantial workload for pathologists, artificial intelligence (AI) assisted
pre-selection of suspicious biopsies could optimize workflow. However, the extracted cell tissue is, highly fragmented
and pathologically less informative than, for example, a surgical resection, making it a difficult problem for AI
assisted diagnosis. Additionally, there has, to date, been no other study on investigating the feasibility of such a
system.

## Data

A total of 3002 pipelle biopsies performed between October 2013 and April 2021 were retrieved from the pathology archive
of the Radboud UMC. To retain a real-life situation, no preselection of cases was performed. H&E-stained slides were
scanned using a 3DHistech P1000 scanner at 0,25 µm/pixel. Images were pseudonymized. A total of 91 whole slide images (
WSI), randomly chosen with a predefined category-weighted key, were immediately set aside to be used in the
interobserver variability study and to be used for evaluation of the algorithm. All were given a category by translating
the diagnostic report into one of the categories in the table below. 2911 cases were used for training and validating
the algorithm.

## Solution

The initial goal of this study was to create an interpretable algorithm, capable of separating the bulk of
non-informative and normal biopsies, from the pre-malignant and malignant ones. This was first extended to a 6-class
problem to serve the clinical guidelines, but this did not yield the required performance. The interobserver variability
study, performed by AIOS resident
pathology <a href="https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/members/sanne-vermorgen/">Sanne Vermorgen</a>, showed that
there was insufficient agreement on certain categories to establish a usable ground truth.

The developed solution is, therefore, an AI-system, based on the multiple instance learning algorithm CLAM[[1]](#1),
that learns to correlate visual patterns on patch-level to binary slide-level diagnosis, based on a single category per
WSI.

</div>

Figure above illustrates the model taking a WSI as input, dividing this into patches (W: 512, H: 512, MMP: 0.5) based on
a tissue mask and then encoding each patch into a vector of length 2048. The CNN used for encoding is a ResNet50
architecture pre-trained using 900.000 histopathology images[[2]](#2). The vectors are weighted using an attention
module and this attention score is used as a pseudo-label. High attention scores should correlate to positive samples
and vice versa. These pseudo-labels are used in a clustering module, which could be seen as a form of self-supervised
learning and meant to improve the feature representation produced by the attention module. The same attention scores are
eventually pooled into a slide-level diagnosis and simultaneously converted into an interpretable heatmap visualisation.
The final output of the modul is thus the likelihood that endometrium (pre)malignancy is present and what patches in the
image attribute to this. The pathologist can determine whether a WSI is (pre)malignant by determining a threshold
themselves. However, a threshold of 0.10 would ensure 100% sensitivity with only a 10% False Positive Rate (FPR). Based
on the distribution of the dataset (65% non-(pre)malignant, 35% (pre)malignant) that was used, this means a workload
reduction for pathologists of 58.5% (65% - 65% * 0.10).

## Conclusion

In this study, we have shown the feasibility of AI-assisted diagnosis for endometrium pipelle biopsies. The fragmented
nature of the biopsies, the lack of tissue (and thus pathological information) in most samples and the lack of agreement
among pathologists make automation of these screenings a difficult problem. However, when reduced into a binary
decision, it shows its value as a tool to potentially be used to pre-screen biopsies and identify all negative cases
automatically. The labels were based on the original pathology report, but since the conclusion of that report often 
consisted of a descriptive diagnosis rather than a definite classification, coding inevitably contained a substantial
amount of subjectivity and, therefore, introduced noise. For future studies, the dataset should be curated using the
majority vote of multiple coders, which minimizes subjectivity.

Finally, the generalisability of the model should be tested using external cohorts, but the dataset used in this study
is the only pipelle sampled endometrium biopsies dataset to date (2022-08-08). Therefore, we encourage medical experts
to try the algorithm on grand-challenge by clicking the button below.
