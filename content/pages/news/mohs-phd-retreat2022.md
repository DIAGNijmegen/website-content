This year on April 21 and April 22 a new edition of the [Radboud Institute for Health Sciences (RIHS)](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/radboud-institute-for-health-sciences) PhD retreat was held at the Pathé cinema in Nijmegen. An event organized by and for PhD candidates of the RIHS.

The short-talk of [members/daan-geijs] was awarded as being second-best out of the 32 participants sharing their research during this annual, two-day event. 

In the limited time of 4 minutes, Daan explained that the incidence of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is rapidly increasing. During the tissue-preserving, surgical removal of these carcinomas (Mohs surgery), microscopic tissue assessment is required to asses whether the surgical edges are free of cancer. Assistance by artificial intelligence can improve the accuracy and efficiency of this procedure. Daan showed how a BCC detection algorithm will be adapted to assist the dermatologist with the histopathological assessment during Mohs surgery. The algorithm (made available through an app) in combination with a customized smartphone holder will enable users to assess the microscopic images through the camera of their phone. The technique will be validated during a prospective clinical trial in [Radboudumc](https://www.radboudumc.nl/) and [Maastricht UMC+](https://www.mumc.nl/), and will be extended to other peripheral centres. This work of Daan Geijs and his colleagues is funded by an [Academic Alliance grant](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/news/acedemic-alliance-2021/).
