[SURF](https://www.surf.nl/en/about-surf/the-surf-cooperative) is a Dutch cooperative with members from education and research institutes around the Netherlands, committed to ensuring that their communities have access to the best IT facilities possible.  The role of teams supporting hardware and software maintenenance and development in research environments cannot be underestimated and we, at DIAG, are delighted to see Anne's work recognized. As part of DIAG's [RSE team](https://rse.diagnijmegen.nl/), Anne works on the software behind our CIRRUS and [Grand-Challenge](https://grand-challenge.org/) platforms among others, and is always available to provide support or work on new solutions for the research team. 

Anne was nominated by her colleagues for her fantastic support to the [DIAG](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) research team in her role as research software engineer. Based on these nominations, an independent jury from SURF selected Anne to receive the award.
