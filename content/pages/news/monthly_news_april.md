## Awards and grants

- [member/kiran-vaidhya-venkadesh] has been selected as a fellow in the **2023 Life Sciences & Health round of the NWO research program Faculty of Impact**. Read more about this achievement in [this news item](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/news/kiran-vaidhya-venkadesh-faculty-of-impact-fellow/).

## Upcoming events

Stay tuned for upcoming events where our team will be presenting our research findings and engaging with the broader medical imaging community. Here are some events to mark on your calendar:

- **DIAG Day May 15th – Hunted the Game:** For this upcoming DIAG Day, we have an exciting activity planned: the DIAG Hunted! Picture this: two teams, thieves and hunters, engaged in a thrilling chase through the city center of Nijmegen. The objective? For thieves to snatch as many diamonds as possible while evading the relentless pursuit of the hunters. The game relies entirely on GPS locations, adding an extra layer of excitement. Don’t forget to sign up!

- **These DIAG members will soon be defending their theses:**
