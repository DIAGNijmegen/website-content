On Tuesday October 15th at 16:30, [member/ward-hendrix] successfully defended his [PhD thesis](https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/310739) titled 'Artificial intelligence for detection of lung and airway nodules in clinical chest CT scans'.
As the title suggests, his research focused on deep learning systems for automated detection of (incidental) lung nodules in chest CT scans.
We congratulate Ward and are pleased that he will continue at DIAG as a Research Scientist in the [RTC Deep Learning team](https://rtc.diagnijmegen.nl/)!
