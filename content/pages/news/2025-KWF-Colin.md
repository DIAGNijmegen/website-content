In March 2025, the Dutch Cancer Society (KWF) started a new fundraiser entitled "Samen sneller". The [AMARA project](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/projects/amara/) led by [member/colin-jacobs] was one of the three projects featured in the fundraiser.
In this project, the development and validation of an AI algorithm for nodule malignancy prediction and its integration in nodule management protocols is investigated. The hypothesis is that this innovative approach will 1) accelerate the time to diagnosis of malignant nodules, and 2) limit unnecessary nodule work-up. 

You can find the campaign website with the video about the AMARA project [here](https://www.kwf.nl/samensneller).

We hope that the new fundraiser will help to raise more funding to support KWF!
