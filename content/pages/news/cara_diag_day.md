On May 31, 2023, the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](http://www.diagnijmegen.nl) celebrated an important event as they officially launched the CARA lab during DIAG Day. The day began with a mini-symposium centered around the theme of intracoronary OCT and ended with an AI challenge in which DIAG members could participate.

The AI challenge brought together six groups of DIAG members who showcased their solutions for detecting and resolving artifacts in intracoronary OCT images. Each group presented their innovative approaches, utilizing AI techniques to address this critical issue. The audience actively participated by voting for their preferred algorithm. After audience voting, the blood detection algorithm stood out as the winning solution, earning its creators the esteemed CARA prize. 

The day concluded with a relaxed gathering where colleagues and CARA lab members had the opportunity to connect and celebrate their achievements over refreshments.
