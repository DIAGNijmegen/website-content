[member/daan-geijs], a fourth-year PhD candidate at the Computational Pathology Group, was featured by Het Financieele Dagblad as one of the 50 promising talents of the Netherlands for 2024. All talents were invited for a tour of the Boijmans Van Beuningen Depot in Rotterdam on February 9th.

Daan was recognized for his research on AI for skin cancer assessment. In particular, he has managed to collect the largest dataset to date for AI in the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Daan aims to automate BCC detection, thereby alleviating the increasing workload of pathologists.

In the article, Daan also takes the opportunity to address some of the hurdles of implementing AI in healthcare, such as outdated IT systems and resistance to change.
