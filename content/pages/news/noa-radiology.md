Outcomes of a retrospective external validation of a deep learning (DL) algorithm for pulmonary nodule malignancy risk stratification using European lung cancer screening data have been published in Radiology.

The study tested a DL algorithm - originally trained on National Lung Screening Trial data - using baseline low-dose CT scans from three large European lung cancer screening trials: the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial, the Multicentric Italian Lung Detection trial, and the Dutch–Belgian NELSON trial.

𝗦𝘁𝘂𝗱𝘆 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 🧪
The pooled cohort included 4,146 participants with 7,614 benign and 180 malignant nodules. Performance of the DL algorithm was compared with the widely used Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer (PanCan) model across the entire dataset and challenging subsets of indeterminate nodules (5–15 mm) and size-matched cancer/benign pairs.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗢𝘂𝘁𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘀 📈
- Overall performance: The DL algorithm achieved AUCs of 0.98, 0.96, and 0.94 for cancers diagnosed within 1 year, 2 years, and throughout screening, respectively—matching or exceeding PanCan (0.98, 0.94, 0.93)
- Indeterminate nodules (5–15 mm): DL significantly outperformed PanCan across all timeframes (AUCs: 0.95, 0.94, 0.90 vs. 0.91, 0.88, 0.86; all P < .05)
- False-positive reduction: At 100% sensitivity for cancers diagnosed within 1 year, DL classified 68.1% of benign nodules as low risk compared to 47.4% with PanCan, a 39.4% relative reduction in false positives
- Size-matched subset: DL reached an AUC of 0.79 versus 0.60 for PanCan (P < .01).

𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 🩺
These results show that deep learning can substantially reduce false positives in lung cancer screening while maintaining high sensitivity. This could potentially reduce unnecessary follow-up scans, costs, and patient anxiety.
