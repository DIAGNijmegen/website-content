The CARA Lab will be present at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress, Europe’s largest conference in cardiovascular medicine, from Friday 29 August to Monday 01 September 2025. 
During a late breaking session, [member/rick-volleberg] will present our latest results from the PECTUS-AI study — showcasing how OCT-AID can support interpretation of intracoronary OCT. This is a key step in our ongoing work to bring AI tools into real-world cardiology practice.
