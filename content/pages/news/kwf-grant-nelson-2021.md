title: KWF consortium grant for research on personalized lung cancer screening
date: 2021-11-04
description: In this project, we aim to maximize lung cancer screening efficiency by developing prediction models to 1) optimize screenee selection, and 2) limit unnecessary nodule work-up.

The [Dutch Cancer Society](https://www.kwf.nl/en/english) has awarded the consortium project ‘Multi-source data approach for Personalized Outcome Prediction in lung cancer screening (NELSON-POP)’ with a grant of 1,425,000 Euro. In this consortium, the unique expertise and data from the various NELSON sites and associated research groups are combined to leverage various unexplored data sources, in order to identify the factors most predictive of lung cancer. [Dr Colin Jacobs, Radboudumc](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/colin-jacobs/) will lead a work package on using artificial intelligence to accurately determine the cancer probability of lung nodules, and subsequently develop optimized nodule management protocols.

[The Dutch-Belgian NELSON trial recently showed that CT screening leads to 24% lung cancer mortality reduction in male long-term smokers](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1911793). If a cohort were invited for screening based on age and long-term smoking (like in NELSON), many individuals would not benefit. Furthermore, many screen-detected lung nodules lead to extra investigations while most nodules are benign. We need methods for stricter selection of screenees who will benefit from screening, and for improved nodule stratification before screening implementation can be considered. In this project we gain fundamental knowledge about the predictive power of data sources and biomarkers that can be derived for NELSON participants, namely genetic and environmental data, lung nodule risk data and chest CT biomarkers. 

The consortium project will be led by prof. dr. Rozemarijn Vliegenthart (University Medical Center Groningen) and brings the expertise of University Medical Center Groningen, Erasmus MC, UMC Utrecht, KU Leuven, Radboud UMC and MUMC+ together. This project is co-funded by [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/nl).
