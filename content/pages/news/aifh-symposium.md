On November 2, Radboudumc AI for health organized a symposium on the impact of AI on healthcare.
The symposium was divided into three talk sessions focused on:

- what did we achieve?: five researchers presented the results of their innovative AI projects;
- what is going to happen?: four new labs presented new developments of AI in healthcare;
- significant impact on healthcare: four Radboudumc spin-off companies talked about how research is being implemented in the clinic.

Between the three talk sessions, two poster sessions were held with demonstrations of recent results from twenty researchers of Radboudumc.

It was great to see the development of different research lines and the significant impact that AI can have on healthcare and we hope this symposium provided the participants with new ideas and directions for the future of their research.
