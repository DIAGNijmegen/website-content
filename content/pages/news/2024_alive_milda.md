description: Milda Pocevičiūtė receives KWF grant for her project ALIVE: ArtificiaL Intelligence for Vulvar prEmalignancies.

[member/milda-poceviciute] has been awarded a KWF grant for her project, 'ALIVE: ArtificiaL Intelligence for Vulvar prEmalignancies'. This high-risk project focusses on vulvar cancer in women with the skin disease lichen sclerosus (LS). With LS, a preliminary stage called differentiated VIN (dVIN) can develop first, which can lead to vulvar cancer much faster, but currently, it is not easy to predict which women will develop vulvar cancer. Collaborating with [member/jeroen-van-der-laak], Milda will develop AI-based tools to better stratify patients with lichen sclerosus (LS) and differentiated VIN (dVIN) into risk categories.
