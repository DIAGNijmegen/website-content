description: Milda Pocevičiūtė receives KWF grant for her project ALIVE: ArtificiaL Intelligence for Vulvar prEmalignancies.

[member/milda-poceviciute] has been awarded a KWF grant for her project, 'ALIVE: ArtificiaL Intelligence for Vulvar prEmalignancies'. This high-risk project focuses on developing AI tools to predict vulvar cancer risk in women affected by the skin disease lichen sclerosus. Patients with lichen sclerosus can develop a preliminary stage called differentiated VIN, which can lead to vulvar cancer much faster. However, predicting which women will develop vulvar cancer remains challenging. 

Collaborating with [member/jeroen-van-der-laak], Milda will develop AI-based tools to better stratify patients with lichen sclerosus and differentiated VIN into risk categories. The goal is to be able to determine which group of patients requires more frequent monitoring, ensuring personalized care tailored to the specific needs.
