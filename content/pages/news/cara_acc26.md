The CARA Lab will be present at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 75th Annual Scientific Session & Expo, taking place March 28–30, 2026 in New Orleans, Louisiana.

During the conference, Ruben van der Waerden and Rick Volleberg will present our latest innovative research on artificial intelligence for intracoronary OCT.

[member/ruben-van-der-waerden] will present his abstract entitled "Artificial Intelligence for Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography: Enabling Real-Time Plaque Segmentation". In this work, he addresses the limitations of complex and therefore slow AI models by investigating a lightweight approach capable of real-time, full-vessel segmentation of intracoronary OCT pullbacks. This research represents an important step toward practical AI-assisted interpretation during cath lab procedures. In a poster session, [member/rick-volleberg] will show a comprehensive validation study of the real-world generalizability of our [OCT-AID](https://academic.oup.com/ehjdh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ehjdh/ztaf021/8078941) model, providing external validation of OCT-AID performance on a large external dataset.
