On Tuesday August 23 at 10.30h, [member/grzegorz-chlebus] will defend his PhD thesis on Deep Learning-Based Segmentation in Multimodal Abdominal Imaging in the Aula of Radboud University. The thesis contains chapters on liver segmentation in MRI scans, liver tumor segmentation in CT scans, on prostate segmentation using multiple MRI sequences, and on active learning, that is, how to optimally select a set of CT slices to obtain the best possible liver segmentation method in CT without the need to manually annotate a large amount of training data. Grzegorz carried out his thesis research at Fraunhofer MEVIS and DIAG and now leads a machine learning team at Qualtrics in Cracow, Poland.
