description: Frédérique Meeuwsen receives the Hanarth Fonds fellowship for her project 'Towards becoming a pathologist of the future'.

[member/frederique-meeuwsen] has been awarded a Hanarth Fonds fellowship for her project, 'Towards becoming a pathologist of the future'. Under the guidance of [member/jeroen-van-der-laak], she will explore every aspect of the AI development cycle, from early problem identification to model development and successful implementation. The Hanarth Fonds grant aims to promote and enhance the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes for cancer patients, with a particular focus on rare cancers.

Pathology diagnostics are under increasing pressure due to rising patient numbers, the growing demand for comprehensive disease characterization, and an expanding range of treatment options, all while the number of pathologists continues to decline. The rise of machine learning-driven image analysis tools offers a promising solution, with AI applications transforming pathology workflows. These tools can assist in tasks such as assessing prognostic biomarkers, tumor grading, diagnosis, and quality control, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy.

However, despite their potential, few AI algorithms are in routine clinical use, and there is a notable lack of studies evaluating their impact in real-world clinical settings. Regulatory challenges and reimbursement issues contribute to a significant "translation gap" in pathology—referring to the difficulty in prospectively validating and integrating AI models into clinical workflows. Additionally, there is a shortage of experts who can navigate the complexities of AI implementation and effectively engage with diverse stakeholders. This gap can only be bridged by involving pathologists who are well-trained in both the clinical and technological aspects of computational pathology.

The combination of leading research at Radboudumc, internships at internationally renowned laboratories, and education will help acquire all the necessary knowledge and practical tools to become a pathologist of the future and bridge the gap between technology and clinical practice.
