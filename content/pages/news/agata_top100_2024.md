description: Agata Polejowska was nominated for TOP woman in Data Science by the Perspektywy Education Foundation

[member/agata-polejowska], who works in the computational pathology unit, has been recognized among the TOP 100 Women in Data Science in Poland. 
She has been nominated in the Data Science Rising Star category for her work in the HEREDITARY project, which explores the gut-brain axis and the microbiome's impact on mental health. 

Her research integrates data from genomics, clinical records, brain imaging, and pathological images.
Research indicates that Poland will need up to 200,000 IT workers by 2025, with a strong demand for data science specialists. 
To meet this demand and ensure technology's broad accessibility and utility, it's crucial to employ a diverse workforce. 
This includes individuals from various backgrounds and cultures, as well as a focus on gender equality. 
Therefore, the Perspektywy Education Foundation has launched the TOP 100 Women in Data Science initiative. 
This program honors women making significant strides in data science and aims to inspire future female professionals in the field. 

We congratulate Agata on this nomination.
