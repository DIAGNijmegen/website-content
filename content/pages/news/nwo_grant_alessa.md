On Wednesday, July 17th, [member/alessa-hering] received a Veni grant from NWO (Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek) for her project "Spotting the Differences: AI-based change detection in medical images"
The goal of her project is to develop AI tools that combine images from different times to spot clinically relevant changes between them. This could really make a difference by helping radiologists to read scans with greater efficiency and therefore improving diagnoses, making treatment choices more effective, and catching less effective therapies sooner.
