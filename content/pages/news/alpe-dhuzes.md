On June 5th, five members of our DIAG/CPG research group — [member/nefise-uysal], [member/clément-grisi], [member/geert-litjens], [member/catherine-chia], and [member/nadieh-khalili] — took part in the annual Alpe d’HuZes event, joining thousands of participants in climbing the Alpe d’Huez mountain to raise funds for cancer research.
Braving cold and wet conditions, they completed a combined total of 10 ascents by foot and by bike. Participating as part of the [Oncode Institute](https://oncodeinstitute.nl/news/oncode-institute-joins-alpe-dhuzes-with-18-teams-to-support-cancer-research), their efforts contributed to an impressive €330,000 raised by Oncode, and to the overall €19 million collected during the event for the Dutch Cancer Society (KWF).

Congratulations to the team on this inspiring achievement, and thank you to everyone who contributed!
