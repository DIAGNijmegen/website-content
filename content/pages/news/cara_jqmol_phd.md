On March 14, Jan-Quinten Mol successfully defended his PhD thesis titled "Identifying novel risk factors for recurrent myocardial infarction. Under the supervision of (https://www.cara-ai-lab.nl/members/niels-van-royen/[Niels van Royen], Prof. Niels Riksen, Dr. Saloua El Messaoudi and Dr. Peter Damman, his research focused on both patient- and plaque-related predictors of recurrent myocardial infarction after an initial ischemic event. As one of the founding fathers of the OCT research line at the Radboudumc, Jan-Quinten played a pivotal role in shaping our research, designing and leading the (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37703036/)[PECTUS-obs study], which laid the foundation for our plaque quantification deep learning algorithm. Together with Rick Volleberg, he contributed significantly to research that now serves as a cornerstone of the CARA lab. We congratulate Jan-Quinten on this achievement and wish him all the best in his further career as a cardiology resident.
