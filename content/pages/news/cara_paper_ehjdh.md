Ruben van der Waerden has published his first first-author paper in European Heart Journal - Digital Health, providing a comprehensive review of AI solutions for intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) analysis.

The study highlights the shift from traditional machine learning to deep learning for OCT interpretation, focusing on lumen analysis, plaque characterization, and stent assessment. While AI models show promising performance, particularly for lumen and stent analysis, challenges remain in plaque evaluation and bias mitigation. Addressing these issues is crucial for clinical adoption.
