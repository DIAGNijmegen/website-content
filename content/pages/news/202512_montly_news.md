## Awards and grants
In November, Bart Sturm successfully defended his PhD thesis on digital and computational pathology, focusing on AI's role in diagnosing early cancers and predicting chemotherapy effectiveness. Bart will now begin his role as a Clinical Pathologist at Pathan.

In December, Megan Schuurmans and Natália Alves both defended their PhD theses on pancreatic cancer AI at Radboud University, earning the cum laude distinction for their outstanding work. Their research contributed to the PANORAMA study, which built an international dataset for pancreatic cancer detection using AI. Their defenses were followed by a symposium on precision oncology and AI. Megan will join Sogeti as a Data Scientist, and Natália will become a Postdoctoral Researcher at Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine.

Additionally, the PANORAMA study was published in The Lancet Oncology, showing that AI outperformed radiologists in detecting pancreatic cancer on CT scans, achieving 92% accuracy compared to 88% for radiologists. Congratulations to all involved in this groundbreaking work!
