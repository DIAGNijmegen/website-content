On the 1st of November 2023, the ICAI Day Autumn Edition took place at Radboud University and Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, organized by DIAG's [member/colin-jacobs], [member/henkjan-huisman], [member/jos-thannhauser], and [member/luc-evers]. The event delved into the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and healthcare, offering a comprehensive exploration of AI's influence on the medical landscape. Bringing together experts, researchers, and enthusiasts, the event featured a diverse agenda that delved into the technical intricacies and broader implications of AI applications in medicine.

## In-Depth Presentations by Leading Experts
The event kicked off with an insightful overview of ICAI health labs by [member/colin-jacobs], setting the stage for presentations by members of several healthcare ICAI labs and field experts. Highlights of the day included presentations from the Healthy AI Lab focusing primarily on AI applications for prostate cancer diagnosis with MRI, CARA Lab focusing on AI-guided cardiac interventions, Brightlands Smart Health Lab's exploration of AI in Radiation Oncology, and AI4 MRI Lab's examination of challenges and opportunities in AI-based MRI reconstruction. 

The CARA Lab's presentation by [member/jos-thannhauser] highlighted the potential of AI-guided cardiac interventions, utilising Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) for increased efficiency and precision during cardiac procedures. [member/henkjan-huisman] from the Healthy AI Lab presented on the use of medical imaging AI, covered issues with current generation AI systems, and focused on recent work in the field of AI for prostate MRI. Thijs van Osch from the AI4 MRI Lab presented specific AI-based approaches to address challenges in MRI reconstruction, including motion artefacts, ultimately accelerating MRI examinations. Petros Kalendralis showcased the research done by the Brightlands Smart Health Lab, providing a transformative perspective on AI in Radiation Oncology, showcasing case studies on FAIR data infrastructures, image analysis, radiotherapy outcomes prediction, and quality assurance. [member/james-meakin] introduced the [Grand Challenge platform](www.grand-challenge.org), a cloud-based solution leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) to advance machine learning applications in biomedical imaging. This platform fosters collaboration and the development of cutting-edge ML solutions, bridging the gap between research and clinical practice.

## Engaging Round Table Discussions
On-site participants immersed themselves in enriching round table discussions covering pivotal healthcare topics. These discussions addressed ethics in healthcare, data governance strategies, challenges and opportunities in implementing AI, the use of foundation models like LLMs for medical text, techniques for explainable AI, legal aspects, and safety measures in the context of AI applications in healthcare.

## Showcasing Cutting-Edge Work
The event also featured a poster and demo session, allowing attendees to explore the latest work from ICAI Labs across the Netherlands. Their contributions were invaluable to the success of the event, as they showcased the remarkable work done.

## A Platform for Networking and Collaboration
The event concluded with a networking session, allowing participants to connect, share insights, and discuss the future of AI in healthcare. The Borrel/Networking session facilitated further exploration of the posters, fostering a collaborative environment for professionals in the field.

The ICAI Day Autumn Edition left attendees with a deeper understanding of AI applications in medicine and a strengthened network of professionals poised to shape the future of healthcare through innovative technology. As AI continues to revolutionise the medical landscape, events like these play a crucial role in fostering collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and the advancement of cutting-edge solutions in healthcare.
