On Monday, November 3rd at 14:30, [member/bart-sturm] successfully defended his [PhD thesis](https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/325461) titled 'On digital and computational pathology: A paradigm shift towards pathology captured in pixels'. His research explored the reliability of diagnoses based on digital images for detecting early stages of vocal cord cancer, skin pigment lesions (including melanoma), and various intestinal diseases. In particular, the dissertation investigates whether pathologists can achieve more accurate diagnoses of skin pigment lesions with computer assistance based on artificial intelligence (AI) - especially in identifying cell division figures. Finally, it examines whether AI can predict the effectiveness of chemotherapy for a specific type of breast cancer using microscopic images. We congratulate Bart and wish him good luck in his position as Clinical Pathologist at Pathan!
