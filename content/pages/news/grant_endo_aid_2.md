description: Francesco Ciompi, in collaboration with JBZ, receives grant for ENDO-AID 2.0: Enhancing ENDOmetrial biopsy Artificial Intelligence assisted Diagnosis.

[member/francesco-ciompi] has been awarded a grant for a Junior Researcher position by the Radboudumc Academic Medical Network. The grant supports the project 'ENDO-AID 2.0: Enhancing ENDOmetrial biopsy Artificial Intelligence assisted Diagnosis', a collaboration between Radboudumc and Jeroen Bosch Hospital (JBZ) aimed at developing AI models for automated detection, diagnosis, and grading of endometrial pathology biopsies.

Building on the previously developed ENDO-AID algorithm, which distinguishes between benign and (pre)malignant histology, this project will extend its capabilities and clinical applicability. New AI models will be trained on a large, multicenter dataset to recognize tumor grade, histological type, and molecular subtype. This will enable more accurate diagnosis, improved risk stratification, and support for personalized treatment decisions in daily practice, with the potential to reduce costs.

Francesco will lead the project in collaboration with Michiel Simons (pathology, Radboudumc) and Louis van der Putten (gynecology, JBZ). The initiative reflects the shared ambition of the Academic Medical Network to promote regional collaboration in innovative and personalized network care.
