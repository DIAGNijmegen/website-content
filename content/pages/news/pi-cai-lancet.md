On June 11th, the primary outcomes of the PI-CAI (Prostate Imaging: Cancer AI) challenge were published in The Lancet Oncology.
The [PI-CAI challenge](https://pi-cai.grand-challenge.org/) aimed to validate modern AI algorithms and estimate radiologists' performance at the detection and diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer in biparametric MRI.
It was hosted on the [Grand-Challenge platform](https://grand-challenge.org/) and comprised over 10,000 carefully-curated prostate MRI exams.
The article, titled 'Artificial intelligence and radiologists in prostate cancer detection on MRI (PI-CAI): an international, paired, non-inferiority, confirmatory study', shows that AI is better than radiologists in finding prostate cancer with fewer false positives.

We congratulate [member/anindo-saha], [member/joeran-bosma], Jasper Twilt, Maarten de Rooij, [member/henkjan-huisman], and the rest of the PI-CAI team for publishing their work!
