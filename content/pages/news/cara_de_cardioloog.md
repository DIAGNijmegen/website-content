In the latest issue of the Dutch journal for cardiologists, "De Cardioloog", Prof. Dr. Niels van Royen, interventional cardiologist and Director of the CARA lab, and Dr. Jos Thannhauser, clinical technician and lab manager of the CARA lab, share insights from their research at the CARA lab. 
In the article, they explain that by using OCT technology, a vast amount of information can be provided during cardiac interventional procedures, often more than the human brain can process efficiently. To manage this, the CARA lab is investigating how artificial intelligence can aid in interpreting OCT data.  By incorporating AI, they hope to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of coronary interventions. The research could significantly impact the decision-making process regarding the use of stents in treating coronary artery disease.
