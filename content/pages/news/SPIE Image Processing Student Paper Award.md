We want to congratulate Xuan Loc Pham and co-authors Mathias Prokop, Bram van Ginneken, and Alessa Hering on winning the SPIE Image Processing Student Paper Award Runner-Up for their paper:
"Divide to Conquer: A Field Decomposition Approach for Multi-Organ Whole-Body CT Image Registration."
Their research addresses a big challenge in medical imaging: the accurate alignment of multiple organs in whole-body CT scans. Existing registration methods often focus on a single organ and struggle with complex deformations across different anatomical structures. To overcome this, the authors introduce a novel field decomposition approach to address the high complexity of deformations in multi-organ whole-body CT image registration. The proposed method is trained and evaluated on a longitudinal dataset of 691 patients, each with two CT images obtained at distinct time points. These scans fully encompass the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic regions. Two baseline registration methods are selected for this study: one based on optimization techniques and another based on deep learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in handling complex deformations in multi-organ whole-body CT image registration.
