As of the 1rst of June, [member/francesco-ciompi] is appointed Associate Professor of Computational Pathology at [Radboudumc](https://www.radboudumc.nl/patientenzorg). Together with his team of postdocs and phds, Francesco develops deep learning-based artificial neural networks for the analysis of histopathological whole-slide images.

After obtaining a master's degree in [Electronic Engineering](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english) and a master's degree in [Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467954774.html), Francesco Ciompi acquired his PhD cum laude in Applied Mathematics and Analysis at the [University of Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/web/portal/en/), Spain. He gained extensive experience by working as a postdoc on computer vision and large-scale image classification in Barcelona and Nijmegen, The Netherlands. In 2015, he joined the Computational Pathology group where he aims to improve patientcare by the development of artificial neural networks for the completion of complex tasks such as immune cell detection, tumor segmentation, and whole-slide image classification. We are happy to congratulate Francesco with this major accomplishment and wish him all the best with the continuation of his exciting research.
