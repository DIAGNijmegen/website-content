On Wednesday September 21 at 10.30h, [member/bart-liefers] will defend his PhD thesis on Deep Learning algorithms for Age-Related Macular Degeneration. The PhD defense will take place at the Aula of the Radboud University and will be streamed online at [this](https://www.ru.nl/aula/livestream) link. 

His [thesis](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/publications/lief22/) is devoted to the applications of deep learning algorithms for automated analysis of retinal images.
It contains chapters on:

1. Automatic detection of the foveal center in OCT scans (Chapter 2);
2. Segmentation of retinal layers and geographic atrophy (Chapter 3);
3. Segmentation of geographic atrophy on color fundus (Chapter 4);
4. Quantification of key retinal features in early and late AMD. (Chapter 5).
