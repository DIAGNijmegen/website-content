groups: cara-lab

This month, [member/jasper-lucas] and [member/job-meuwese] from the University of Twente have joined the CARA Lab to conduct their graduation internships at Radboudumc. Both projects focus on advancing AI applications in cardiac interventional procedures.

Jasper, specializing in medical image analysis, will contribute to improving our [OCT-AID](https://www.cara-ai-lab.nl/news/cara_paper_multiclass/) algorithm by developing innovative 3D training strategies for improved model performance.
Jobâ€™s research centers on hemodynamic analysis during TAVI procedures, applying AI to predict adverse outcomes such as paravalvular leakage and heart failure. In addition, he will investigate FFR signal patterns during PCI to explore their relationship with atherosclerosis and underlying pathophysiology.
Both Jasper and Job will also support the CARA team in ongoing clinical studies.

We warmly welcome them to the team and wish them a productive and inspiring time at CARA Lab!
