This month, two Technical Medicine students from the University of Twente, Jasper Lucas and Job Meuwese, have started their graduation projects in our lab.

Jasper Lucas is specializing in medical image analysis and will work on improving our [OCT-AID](https://www.cara-ai-lab.nl/news/cara_paper_multiclass/) algorithm, focusing on the development of new 3D training methods. Job will conduct his research during cath lab procedures. During TAVI procedures, he will study hemodynamic parameters and apply AI techniques to predict adverse outcomes such as paravalvular leakage and heart failure. In PCI procedures, he will analyze FFR signals in relation to underlying pathophysiology and atherosclerotic disease. Both Jasper and Job will also support the CARA team in ongoing clinical studies.

We wish them an educational and successful period in our lab!
