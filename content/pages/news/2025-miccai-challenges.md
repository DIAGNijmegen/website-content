The [MICCAI 2025](https://conferences.miccai.org/2025/en/) conference in Daejeon, South Korea was an exciting and productive week for the DIAG community, with strong contributions across challenges, workshops, tutorials, and presentations. In this update, we spotlight DIAG’s involvement in the challenges. More updates will follow on the **workshops** organized or contributed to by DIAG at MICCAI 2025.

## Grand Challenge powering MICCAI challenges
Grand Challenge (GC) played a central role at the challenges organized at MICCAI 2025: it was the platform of choice for 45% of all 46 challenges organized at MICCAI 2025. This underscores the continued trust of the international community in the platform for hosting large-scale benchmarking efforts.
