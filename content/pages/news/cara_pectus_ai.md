In the PECTUS-AI study, led by [member/rick-volleberg] and [member/thijs-luttikholt], we performed a secondary analysis of the prospective observational PECTUS-obs trial, and investigated whether artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to identify thin-cap fibroatheromas (TCFA)—a high-risk plaque feature linked to adverse outcomes. Traditionally, TCFA detection with OCT requires expert readers and is time-consuming, limiting its clinical applicability.

In this study, OCT images from 413 patients with myocardial infarction were analyzed using both an independent core laboratory (CL-TCFA) and OCT-AID, our validated AI segmentation algorithm (AI-TCFA). At two years follow-up, AI-TCFA in target lesions was significantly associated with the composite primary outcome of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or unplanned revascularization. Importantly, AI-based assessment of the complete OCT pullback showed an even stronger prognostic value, with a negative predictive value of nearly 98%.

Key findings:

- AI-TCFA was identified in 34.5% of patients, CL-TCFA in 30.0%.

- AI-TCFA in target lesions predicted adverse outcomes [HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.02–3.90].

- AI-TCFA across complete pullbacks provided even higher risk discrimination [HR 5.50, 95% CI 1.94–15.62].

Conclusion:

AI-based OCT image analysis enables standardized, efficient detection of high-risk coronary plaques and provides superior prognostic value compared to conventional expert assessment. These findings support the potential of AI to transform intracoronary imaging into a powerful tool for risk stratification in daily clinical practice.
