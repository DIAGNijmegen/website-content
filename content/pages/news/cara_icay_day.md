On November 1, 2023, the Radboud University in Nijmegen hosted the [ICAI Day Autumn Edition](https://icai.ai/event/icai-day-november-2023/), delving into the fusion of artificial intelligence and healthcare. This hybrid event provided a comprehensive look at AI's technical role in modern medicine, featuring interesting presentations, on-site round table discussions led by experts, and poster showcases from ICAI Labs across the Netherlands.

The agenda was packed with highlights, including advancements in AI applied to radiation Oocology, challenges faced in MRI reconstruction, and the development of AI frameworks. Beyond technical aspects, discussions extended to the ethical, governance, implementation, and legal considerations of AI in healthcare. Notably, the CARA lab made significant contributions, with a plenary talk by Jos Thannhauser and the presentation of two posters showcasing the lab's objectives and initial outcomes of their OCT segmentation algorithm.
