Agata Polejowska was awarded 2nd place and 3rd place in the [NeurIPS CURE-Bench Competition](https://curebench.ai/) organized by the Harvard, MIT, and Milken Institutes. This impressive achievement was crowned by a travel grant, providing the opportunity to participate in the CURE-Bench workshop at the NeurIPS 2025 conference in San Diego. 

The NeurIPS CURE-Bench Competition was hosted with the aim of creating large language models capable of answering a wide range of clinical tasks. This included, for example, the translation of information written by clinicians to patient-focused information.  Agata’s solution (curaive – adaptive case-tailoring of structured precision therapeutics-focused reasoning with mimicked self-determination mechanism: precision therapeutic decision support system delivering structured reports) prioritized patient context to enable the model’s answer to be “indeterminable”. This, combined with dynamic and adaptive prompting, scored 2nd and 3rd place in two separate tracks.
