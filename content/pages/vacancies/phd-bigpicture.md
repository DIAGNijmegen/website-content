description: PhD position for developing and validating AI algorithms for automated analysis of digital pathology images in collaboration with the BigPicture consortium

## Background
Diagnostic pathology involves microscopic evaluation of human tissues. Increasingly, microscopic images are digitized to support the diagnostic workflow. This rapidly growing field of digital pathology also yields ample opportunities for development of algorithms based on artificial intelligence (AI). While artificial intelligence is enabling computer systems to perform more and more complex tasks, the access to large-scale adequate pathology images to efficiently train AI algorithms is still a rate limiting step for AI-supported pathology. 

We are currently looking for a PhD student to work within the EU funded [BigPicture](https://www.bigpicture.eu) project. The aim of Bigpicture is to take up this data availability challenge and set up the first European, ethical- and General Data Protection Regulation-compliant, quality-controlled and community-based platform, in which both large-scale data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms will coexist.

During your PhD trajectory, you will develop and validate AI algorithms for automated analysis of digital pathology whole-slide images in both clinical (i.e., human tissue) and toxicological (i.e., animal tissue) pathology cases. Particular focus will be on development of robust and interpretable of tissue-agnostic algorithms, seamlessly applicable to different types of tissues, as well as on implementation and validation of these algorithms on the large-scale digital pathology repository developed in the BigPicture project.

## Profile
We are looking for:
- A creative and enthusiastic researcher (to be) with a master degree in a relevant field, such as artificial intelligence, computer vision, machine learning, data science.
- A person with a clear interest to work with AI algorithms and that has an affinity with medical topics.
- Someone with good communication skills.

## We offer
- An exciting position in one of Europe's largest research groups in Computational Pathology.
- An international work environment with an informal atmosphere.
- 4-year contract of 36 hours per week (full time).
- Salary scale 10A.
- An annual vacation allowance of 8% and you will receive an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%.
- 168 vacation hours (over 23 days) per year.
- 70% coverage of the pension premium by Radboudumc. You pay the rest of the premium with your gross salary.
- A discount on health insurance.

## Organisation
The [Computational Pathology Group](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/) is a research group of the department of Pathology of the [Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc)](https://www.radboudumc.nl). We are also part of the cross-departmental [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl) at Radboudumc, with researchers in the departments of [Radiology and Nuclear Medicine](https://www.radboudumc.nl/afdelingen/radiologie-en-nucleaire-geneeskunde), [Pathology](https://www.radboudumc.nl/afdelingen/pathologie) and [Ophthalmology](https://www.radboudumc.nl/afdelingen/oogheelkunde).

We develop, validate and deploy novel medical image analysis methods, usually based on the newest advances in machine learning with a focus on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Application areas include diagnostics and prognostics of breast, colon, prostate and lung cancer. Our group is among the international front runners in the field, witnessed for instance by the highly successful [Camelyon](https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/) and [Panda](https://panda.grand-challenge.org/) grand challenges which we organized.

Radboudumc strives to be a leading developer of sustainable, innovative and affordable healthcare to improve the health and wellbeing of people and society in the Netherlands and beyond. This is the core of our mission: To have a significant impact on healthcare. To get a better picture of what this entails, check out our [strategy](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/about-radboudumc/our-strategy).

## Employment conditions
Upon commencement of employment we require a certificate of conduct (Verklaring Omtrent het Gedrag, VOG) and there will be, depending on the type of job, a screening based on the provided cv. Radboud university medical centerâ€™s HR Department will apply for this certificate on your behalf.
