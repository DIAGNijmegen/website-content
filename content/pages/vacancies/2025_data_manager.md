description: Data Manager position within the Bigpicture project

## Job description
Would you like to contribute to groundbreaking research in artificial intelligence for healthcare? Work in a dynamic and stimulating environment where you get to engage with diverse, international teams? We are looking for a Data Manager to join our Computational Pathology Group.

Within the EU-funded [Bigpicture](http://bigpicture.eu/) project, diverse parties upload their medical data (images and corresponding meta-data) to a central platform. Because each data provider operates a different IT infrastructure, a 'one size fits all' solution is not feasible. Instead, we tailor a set of existing tools to the local setup and provide targeted advice and technical support. Data providers may either be project members (beneficiaries) or outside parties (so-called slide contributing third parties, SCTPs). Different parties will have very diverse technical expertise. To support this wide range of data providers as much as possible, we are looking for a customer-friendly technically skilled Data Manager / ICT Specialist.   

## Tasks and responsibilities
Key responsibilities in the Bigpicture project:

- Provide general technical advice on setting up local IT infrastructure for data upload to the Bigpicture portal.
- Support data preparation including streamlining metadata handling.
- Helping partners set up and use the various tools (SlideTap, Dicomizer etc).
- Provide feedback to the tool building parties so that these tools can be improved in their functionality and usability.
- Share and maintain the Radboudumc built tools with the broader Bigpicture community.
- Gradually build a knowledge base for future support of Bigpicture data providers.

Next to the Bigpicture project, you will join the data team of the Computational Pathology Group and support researchers in handling data requests and execute a range of other tasks. 

## Profile
You are a passionate Data Manager with a strong technical background. You are motivated to help beneficiaries and SCTPs succeed in uploading their data, and you thrive in a collaborative environment. You are an excellent communicator, a team player, and a problem-solver with outstanding troubleshooting skills. You communicate clearly, solve problems efficiently, and are willing to travel within Europe if the work requires it. Moreover, you have:

- Hbo-level degree in Bioinformatics (including Web Development), Computer Science or a related technical field.
- Experienced in web development using Python and read with hands-on experience deploying applications in Docker environments.
- Proficient in English and preferably also proficient in Dutch.
- Familiarity with:
    - DICOM data or other medical imaging formats (a plus).
    - Relational databases and SQL in general.
    - PostgreSQL in particular (a plus).

## Place of work
The Computational Pathology Group is a research group of the department of [Pathology](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/departments/pathology) of the Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc). We are also part of the cross-departmental [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) at Radboudumc. We develop, validate and deploy novel medical image analysis methods, usually based on the newest advances in machine learning with a focus on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Application areas include diagnostics and prognostics of breast, colon, prostate and lung cancer.

You will work at the Computational Pathology Group ([CPG](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/research/research-groups/computational-pathology)) of the [Department of Pathology](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/departments/pathology) of the Radboud University Medical Center Nijmegen. CPG currently has ~40 researchers focused on various topics in the use of AI for pathology. Our focus is the development and validation of novel methods in a broad range of computational pathology applications. We focus on automated grading of breast and prostate cancer, prediction of therapy outcome for lung cancer, assessment of kidney biopsies and many other applications.

Key to the success of the group is close cooperation with clinicians. A team of scientific programmers is supporting our deep learning research for large-scale experimentation. It's an exciting and supportive place to work, and we are proud to say we have a diverse team and an open culture.
