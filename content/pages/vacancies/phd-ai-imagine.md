description: PhD position for developing innovative AI methods for intra-operative evaluation and prediction of treatment success in thermal ablation treatment of liver tumors with the AI-IMAGINE project

## Background
Are you a PhD candidate who is motivated to develop state-of-the-art medical imaging AI and integrate this to improve treatment of patients with liver tumors? In the AI-IMAGINE project we aim to develop AI with real clinical impact. Will you join our ambitious team? 

As a PhD candidate, you will collaborate with a group of international clinicians and AI experts to explore innovative AI methods for intra-operative evaluation and prediction of treatment success in thermal ablation treatment of liver tumors. This empowers clinicians to better assess treatment success during the actual treatment itself and, in future patients, allow immediate corrective treatment. Ultimately, we aim to enable first time-right treatment in all liver tumor patients and prevent unwanted re-treatments.

You will work from bench-to-bedside, covering the whole spectrum from data selection, curation, model development to first application in a clinical study. You will be involved in an international collaboration between Radboudumc, Leiden University Medical Center, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Medical University Innsbruck, Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Medicine and the Dutch Liver Patient Association. The research is funded by a grant from Stichting Hanarth Fonds.

## Profile
You are an enthusiastic, highly motivated PhD candidate with a curious attitude, pro-active personality and a drive to make impact through clinical use of AI.

Moreover you have:

- A background in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Technical Medicine or similar.
- Affinity with medical imaging AI. 
- Expertise in software development, preferably Python. 
- Academic writing, presentation and communication skills.
- Prior experience with deep learning, machine learning and image analysis is a plus. 

Are you in doubt whether you might be the right person for this position? Please do apply.

## We offer
- A stimulating and inspiring environment with a focus on direct impact on healthcare.
- A strong, multidisciplinary supervision team, headed by Kristian Overduin, technical physician Interventional Radiology, and Henkjan Huisman, professor of Medical Imaging AI at Radboudumc. 
- Multitude of learning opportunities for personal and professional development (e.g. courses, conferences). 

## Organisation
You will be appointed at the Medical Imaging department of [Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc)](https://www.radboudumc.nl). Worldwide, we are one of the top-ranking institutes for Radiology with an international reputation on AI research. You will be jointly appointed in the [MAGIC](https://magicnijmegen.nl/) and [DIAG](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl) research groups and work with a multidisciplinary group of colleagues with expertise in interventional radiology, technical medicine, AI and informatics.

The MAGIC group is at the fore-front of developing and implementing image-guided therapy, shaping the future of minimally invasive tumor treatments. The group is world-leading in MRI-guided prostate treatment and has strong expertise in bringing innovations to clinical practice. MAGIC is headed by Prof. Jurgen Fütterer and is home to over 20 people, of which more than 10 PhD candidates.

The DIAG group is internationally renowned for its research on deep learning AI in medical imaging for over 30 years. DIAG spans Depts. Radiology, Pathology, Cardiology, Urology, Radiation Oncology and more. DIAG hosts over 70 PhD students, 6 PIs, and has a large local computational facility (100GPUs, DGX1) and collaboration with AWS. DIAG is at the front-end of AI research (Foundation models, Agents, Grand-Challenge.org). DIAG is a collaboration of labs, and Prof Henkjan Huisman's lab is researching AI for abdominal imaging (PICAI, PANORAMA).
