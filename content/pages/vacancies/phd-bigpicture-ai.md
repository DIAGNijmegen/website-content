description: PhD position for developing novel, explainable machine learning algorithms for end-to-end learning with gigapixel pathology images in collaboration with the BigPicture consortium

## Background
This project is part of the European [BigPicture](https://www.bigpicture.eu) project, which aims to establish the largest digital pathology repository in the world, with over three million images and associated diagnostic information. This type of data offers incredible potential for machine learning algorithms to impact pathology practice, but also requires sophisticated AI tools to get the most from this data. That is where you come in. In this project you will develop new machine learning methods for end-to-end training on gigapixel-sized images, investigate AI explainability and transfer learning strategies, and work with algorithms for content-based image retrieval and federated learning. You will work together with the over forty partners in the consortium which spans almost the entirety of Europe (and even further), including both academic partners, small, and big corporations.

## Profile
You are a creative and ambitious researcher with a MSc degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, Technical Medicine, Biomedical Sciences or similar, with a clear interest in artificial intelligence and medical image analysis. Good communication and organizational skills are essential. Experience with deep learning and programming, preferably in Python, are a plus and should be evident from the (online) courses you've followed, your publications, GitHub account, etc.

## Organization
### Computational Pathology Group
The [Computational Pathology Group](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/) is a research group of the department of Pathology of the [Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc)](https://www.radboudumc.nl). We are also part of the cross-departmental [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl) at Radboudumc, with researchers in the departments of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Pathology and Ophthalmology.

We develop, validate and deploy novel medical image analysis methods, usually based on the newest advances in machine learning with a focus on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Application areas include diagnostics and prognostics of breast, colon, prostate and lung cancer, but also non-oncological topics such as kidney transplantation. Our group is among the international front runners in the field, witnessed for instance by the highly successful Camelyon and Panda grand challenges which we organized.

### Radboudumc
[Radboud university medical center](www.radboudumc.nl) is a university medical center for patient care, scientific research, and education in Nijmegen. Radboud university medical center strives to be at the forefront of shaping the healthcare of the future. We do this in a person-centered and innovative way, and in close collaboration with our network. We want to have a significant impact on healthcare. We want to improve with each passing day, continuously working towards better healthcare, research, and education. And gaining a better understanding of how diseases arise and how we can prevent, treat, and cure them, day in and day out. This way, every patient always receives the best healthcare, now and in the future. Because that is why we do what we do.
