description: PhD Candidate for "Improving assessment of adverse histopathology on multi-parametric prostate MRI using AI and radiology-pathology fusion" at CWZ and Radboudumc

The Department of Urology at Canisius Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis (CWZ) and Pathology at Radboudumc challenge an enthusiastic and talented researcher/PhD candidate to participate in the PhD track titled "Improving assessment of adverse histopathology on multi-parametric prostate MRI using AI and radiology-pathology fusion." Do you want to work as a PhD candidate at a leading international research institute and be guided by an experienced promotion team? Don't hesitate to apply for this position!

## Background
In recent years, the diagnostic and treatment options for men with prostate cancer have significantly increased, positively impacting life expectancy and quality of life. To achieve the best possible outcome after prostate removal, it is crucial to not only remove the entire tumor but also to preserve nerves and the urethra for maintaining continence and potency. For an optimal surgical outcome, the surgeon must know precisely where the tumor is located in the prostate. By fusing MRI images with pathology from prostate specimens, the accuracy of the MRI will increase, allowing surgeons to operate more conservatively with fewer adverse consequences.
As a researcher/PhD candidate on the PhD track "Improving assessment of adverse histopathology on multi-parametric prostate MRI using AI and radiology-pathology fusion," you will develop an algorithm for this purpose. Data from approximately 800 prostate MRIs and prostate specimens are available for this project. The algorithm will be tested in practice and related to surgical outcomes.

## Supervision
During your PhD track, your daily supervision at CWZ will be handled by Dr. Jean-Paul van Basten, Urologist at CWZ and manager of Prosper Clinics, who is also co-promotor. At Radboudumc, your daily supervision will be handled by Dr. Nadieh Khalili, who will also act as co-promotor. Prof. Geert Litjens from Radboudumc will act as the promotor. At CWZ, you will work in the Urology department, a dynamic department where care and science come together in an environment that pays great attention to education. You will also receive guidance from the CWZ Academy, including training sessions and planned consultation moments with other PhD candidates. Additionally, you will be able to take courses at Radboudumc and be part of the Radboud Institute for Medical Innovation Research School.
