description: PhD Prostate Cancer Ultrasound Artificial Intelligence

## Background
One in eight men is confronted with prostate cancer (PCa). The current diagnostic trajectory has many shortcomings. The PSA blood test has too many false alarms, causing unnecessary biopsies and missing clinically significant PCa (csPCa) that can still be cured. Current basic ultrasound technology‐guided biopsies are inadequate as a follow‐up to the PSA test. These biopsies are too uncertain, causing further over/underdiagnosis/treatment. As a result, early detection is unfeasible, and prostate cancer is often detected only at a late, fatal stage. Research into timely, accurate, widely available diagnostic modalities is therefore crucial. Recently, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has evidenced clinical value in reducing unnecessary biopsies. However, MRI is costly and requires expert skills during reading and biopsy. New technology research can result in a breakthrough. Firstly, novel ultrasound parameters show an increased diagnostic accuracy, evidencing the potential for multiparametric ultrasound (mpUS) to become a valuable, cost-effective option for diagnosis and biopsy guidance. Secondly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a powerful tool to enhance medical image interpretation and reduce diagnostic and interventional workflow and costs. The current rise of mpMRI and MRI‐guided ultrasound provides a solid basis for generating ground‐truth data of csPCa presence to train and explore AI. 

PICUS is a recently awarded [NWO](www.nwo.nl) project that leverages these novel mpUS advances and AI assistance to predict the presence, location, and aggressiveness (risk of developing metastases) of PCa. PICUS is led by the Technical University Eindhoven (prof. Massimo Misschi) in collaboration with Radboudumc and various other public and private partners (Canon Medical, General Electric, Angiogenesis Analytics, Martini Klinik Hamburg, Prostaatkanker Stichting). The Radboudumc team will focus on developing AI‐assisted mpUS+mpMR extending upon our state‐of‐the‐art mpMRI AI. Initially, standard US parameters will be used, which will later be enhanced by novel parameters developed in PICUS. The AI aims at three purposes: (1) to expand mpMRI in its
ability to characterize lesions in order to improve specificity; (2) to improve biopsy targeting by fusing mpUS and mpMRI. (3) Standalone detection of prostate cancer on mpUS as a cost-effective alternative to mpMR.

In this project, you will collaborate with the clinical biopsy team in the urology clinic at Radboudumc and set up a data acquisition pipeline. You will link ultrasound and MRI data and expand our collection of reference standard meta-parameters. You will develop advanced machine learning methods for end-to-end training on ultrasound images, investigate AI uncertainty, and use of foundation models. You will work together with international partners in the PICUS consortium. You will work with over 80PhD in the DIAG group and present results at international meetings.

## Tasks and responsibilities
- Collaborate with the clinical prostate biopsy team and set up the data acquisition pipeline.
- Implement automated QA and tissue recognition algorithms.
- Quantification and automated extraction of known biomarkers.
- Work with weakly-supervised learning techniques to identify toxicological lesions (anomaly detection).
- Collaborate with toxicological pathologists and other members of the BigPicture consortium.
- Have fun interactions with colleagues, present at local and (inter)national conferences, and further develop yourself as an independent researcher.

## Profile
You should be a highly motivated, creative, and enthusiastic researcher with an MSc degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering, or equivalent. You have a thorough understanding of deep learning and can adapt deep learning algorithms. You have a good knowledge of image processing, preferably ultrasound. The research should result in a Ph.D. thesis, requiring you to have good communication skills to excel at presenting results at scientific meetings and in scientific journals.

## We offer
- An exciting position in the world-wide top-4 research group in Radiology AI.
- An international work environment with an informal atmosphere.
- 4-year contract of 36 hours per week (full time).
- Salary scale 10A.
- An annual vacation allowance of 8%, and you will receive an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%.
- 168 vacation hours (over 23 days) per year.
- Radboudumc provides 70% coverage of the pension premium. You pay the rest of the premium with your gross salary.
- A discount on health insurance.

## Organisation
The research group of Professor Huisman is part of the Department of Radiology of the [Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc)](https://www.radboudumc.nl). The lab is also part of the cross-departmental [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl) at Radboudumc, with researchers in other departments, such as [Radiology and Nuclear Medicine](https://www.radboudumc.nl/afdelingen/radiologie-en-nucleaire-geneeskunde), [Pathology](https://www.radboudumc.nl/afdelingen/pathologie).

We develop, validate and deploy novel medical image analysis methods, usually based on the newest advances in machine learning with a focus on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Application areas include diagnostics and prognostics of breast, colon, prostate and lung cancer. Our group is among the international front runners in the field, witnessed, for instance, by the highly successful [PICAI](https://pi-cai.grand-challenge.org/) [Camelyon](https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/) and [Panda](https://panda.grand-challenge.org/) grand challenges which we organized.

Radboudumc strives to be a leading developer of sustainable, innovative, and affordable healthcare to improve the health and wellbeing of people and society in the Netherlands and beyond. This is the core of our mission: To have a significant impact on healthcare. To get a better picture of what this entails, check out our [strategy](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/about-radboudumc/our-strategy).
