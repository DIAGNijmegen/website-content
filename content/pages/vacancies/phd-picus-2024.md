description: PhD Prostate Cancer Ultrasound Artificial Intelligence

## Background
One million men receive a diagnosis of prostate cancer, and three hundred thousand die from prostate cancer each year worldwide. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a current breakthrough in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer.

This project is part of the PICUS project, which aims to  

In this project you will develop new machine learning methods for end-to-end training on gigapixel-sized images, investigate AI explainability and transfer learning strategies. The application area for this project is XXX. You will work together with the over other partners in the consortium which spans almost the entirety of Europe (and even further), including both academic partners, small, and big corporations. Within this project specifically, there is a close collaboration with TU/e.

## Tasks and responsibilities
- Implement automated QA and tissue recognition algorithms.
- Quantification and automated extraction of known biomarkers.
- Work with weakly-supervised learning techniques to identify toxicological lesions (anomaly detection).
- Collaborate with toxicological pathologists and other members of the BigPicture consortium.
- Have fun interactions with colleagues, present at local and (inter)national conferences, and further develop yourself as an independent researcher.

## Profile
You should be a highly motivated, creative, and enthusiastic researcher with an MSc degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering, or equivalent. You have a thorough understanding of deep learning and can adapt deep learning algorithms. You have a good knowledge of image processing, preferably ultrasound. The research should result in a Ph.D. thesis, requiring you to have good communication skills to excel at presenting results at scientific meetings and in scientific journals.

## We offer
- An exciting position in the world-wide top-4 research group in Radiology AI.
- An international work environment with an informal atmosphere.
- 4-year contract of 36 hours per week (full time).
- Salary scale 10A.
- An annual vacation allowance of 8%, and you will receive an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%.
- 168 vacation hours (over 23 days) per year.
- Radboudumc provides 70% coverage of the pension premium. You pay the rest of the premium with your gross salary.
- A discount on health insurance.

## Organisation
The research group of Professor Huisman is part of the Department of Radiology of the [Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc)](https://www.radboudumc.nl). The lab is also part of the cross-departmental [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl) at Radboudumc, with researchers in other departments, such as [Radiology and Nuclear Medicine](https://www.radboudumc.nl/afdelingen/radiologie-en-nucleaire-geneeskunde), [Pathology](https://www.radboudumc.nl/afdelingen/pathologie).

We develop, validate and deploy novel medical image analysis methods, usually based on the newest advances in machine learning with a focus on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Application areas include diagnostics and prognostics of breast, colon, prostate and lung cancer. Our group is among the international front runners in the field, witnessed, for instance, by the highly successful [PICAI](https://pi-cai.grand-challenge.org/) [Camelyon](https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/) and [Panda](https://panda.grand-challenge.org/) grand challenges which we organized.

Radboudumc strives to be a leading developer of sustainable, innovative, and affordable healthcare to improve the health and wellbeing of people and society in the Netherlands and beyond. This is the core of our mission: To have a significant impact on healthcare. To get a better picture of what this entails, check out our [strategy](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/about-radboudumc/our-strategy).
