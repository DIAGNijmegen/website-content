description: We are offering a PhD position on biomedical image registration

## Background
Image registration is an essential process that involves aligning two or more images to achieve spatial correspondence at every point. This step is crucial in medical image analysis as it enables the integration of previously unrelated data, allowing for joint processing of the information. One significant application of image registration is in the follow-up assessment of cancer patients. By establishing spatial correspondences between multiple images, it aligns anatomical structures and facilitates the automatic quantification of findings in subsequent imaging examinations. This saves radiologists a significant amount of time while ensuring accurate and efficient patient care.


## Job description
The PhD project aims to develop a generic image registration framework that is capable of automatically configuring itself to be applied to several tasks. The main focus of the PhD is on the technical development of appropriate methods and requires a certain mathematical understanding. However, the methods developed are to be applied in the field of medical image processing and in particular in the field of oncological treatment assessment.  

## Tasks and responsibilites

* Conduct research in the development of image registration methods 
* Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team to translate cutting-edge technology into clinical practice
* Publish research findings in peer-reviewed journals and present at international conferences
* Mentor junior team members and contribute to the development of the lab's research direction
* Co-organize the international Learn2Reg image registration challenge and be active in the research community 


## Profile
You should
* be a creative and enthusiastic researcher with an MSc degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Engineering or similar
* have a clear interest to develop artificial intelligence algorithms and an affinity with healthcare 
* have good communication skills and enjoy working in a multidisciplinary team
* have expertise in software development, preferably in Python
* having experience with deep learning, machine learning, and image analysis or time series analysis is a plus.



## Terms of employment
You will be appointed for four years as a PhD student with the standard salary and secondary conditions for PhD students in the Netherlands. The research should result in a PhD thesis.

## Organization
You will work in the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG) DIAG is part of the Departments of Imaging, Pathology, Ophthalmology, and Radiation Oncology of Radboud University Medical Center. We develop computer algorithms to interpret and process medical images. The group currently consists of around 70 researchers. Radboud University Medical Center and Radboud University are located in Nijmegen, the oldest Dutch city with a rich history and one of the liveliest city centers in the Netherlands. Radboud University has over 17,000 students. Radboud UMC is a leading academic center for medical science, education and health care with over 8,500 staff and 3,000 students.
