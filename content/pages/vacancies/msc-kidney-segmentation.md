description: Extending kidney tissue segmentation algorithm to other tissue compartements

## Clinical Problem 
Inflammation and chronic changes in the different tissue compartments (e.g. glomeruli, tubulo-interstitium, vasculature) are important prognostic features for kidney (transplant) function and guide treatment decision. Quantitative scoring of these features is therefore very important for transplant diagnostics and kidney research. However, visual scoring by pathologists is poorly reproducible and labor-intensive. Within the [DIAGGRAFT project](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/projects/diaggraft/) (funded by the Dutch kidney foundation), we aim to automatically quantify inflammation in different tissue compartments. This is only possible if we have a reliable tissue segmentation.

## Approach
Hermsen et al.<sup>[1]</sup> have proposed a first approach to the task of tissue segmentation using a U-net architecture. This approach, however, did not include peritubular capillaries (PTC), for which we have since collected annotations.
The goal of this project is to extend the tissue segmentation model to include this additional class and to investigate current state-of-the-art segmentation model(s) to improve the performance.

## Data 
The dataset used in<sup>[1]</sup> contains 125 whole slide images (WSI) annotated for 10 different tissue types (glomeruli, sclerotic glomeruli, empty Bowman capsules, proximal tubuli, distal tubuli, atrophic tubuli, capsule, arteries/arterioles, interstitium, and border). Additionally, there is a dataset of 69 WSI with annotations for peritubular capillaries. If needed, more images are available, and a resident pathologist is involved in the project to help interpret results and provide new annotations.
