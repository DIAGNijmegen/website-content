description: Towards improving our understanding of the development of signet ring cell carcinoma in the gastrointestinal tract

## Background
There is a specific type of cancer occurring throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract called signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC), based on the morphology of the cells that look like signet rings under the microscope. This type of cancer is associated with a very poor outcome and seems to be more common in young people. However, very little is known about the molecular characteristics of SRCC and its development in different locations of the GI tract, essential pieces of knowledge that are needed to work towards better future treatment strategies.

## Approach
In this project, we will investigate the molecular profile of SRCC using histopathology data and spatial transcriptomics technology. We will develop image analysis and pattern recognition techniques using artificial intelligence models, to compare and contrast SRCC from the colon and stomach investigating their molecular components identifying patterns of gene expression.

## Data 
We will use 40 SRCC from the colon and 40 SRCC from the stomach, selected from the pathology archive of the Radboudumc. From the tumor tissue we will use:
* Digital pathology whole-slide images (WSI) and tissue microarray (TMA) cores stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
* TSO500 mutational analysis
* NanoString GeoMx spatial transcriptomics of tumor and stroma
