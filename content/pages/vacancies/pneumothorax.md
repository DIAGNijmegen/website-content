description: Develop a system to detect pneumothorax in frontal chest radiographs.


## Background
In 2018, the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) organized an international machine learning challenge about detecting and localizing pneumonia in chest radiographs. The challenge used images from a publicly available chest x-ray dataset from the National Institutes of Health with annotations made by radiologists. The challenge was hosted on a platform provided by Kaggle, Inc., which also provided $30,000 in prize money for the competition. More than 1400 teams participated in the preliminary stage of the challenge and 346 teams in the final stage. ([source](https://www.ajronline.org/doi/full/10.2214/AJR.19.21512)) 

## Research question and tasks
Under this student project we are aiming to create a globally applicable algorithm for detecting pneumonia in chest x-rays. 

### Tasks
* Research previous work on pneumonia detection
* Develop a deep learning method that tackles the task
* Publish results to [the offline leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/leaderboard)
* Test your model on datasets from different institutions
* Publish your algorithm under an open source license

<!-- ## Innovation -->


## Requirements
- Students at the final year of a study in computer science, artificial intelligence, physics, or a related area.
- Knowledge on and experience with deep learning image analysis. You should be able to implement systems described in [this book](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python). 

## Information
