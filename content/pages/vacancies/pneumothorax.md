description: Develop a system to detect pneumothorax in frontal chest radiographs.

## Background
Pneumothorax is a critical medical condition, commonly referred to as a collapsed lung. It can be painful and is potentially deadly, so pneumothorax requires immediate attention. Pneumothorax may be caused by an underlying lung disease, a blunt chest injury or can occur after surgery. It can also occur spontaneously. It is generally diagnosed by radiologists through examining chest radiographs (chest x-rays) and can be difficult to confirm - can you see the pneumothorax in the image shown here?! For further information see [the Radiopaedia definition](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pneumothorax) or the [Radiology Assistant](http://www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/p497b2a265d96d#in5150424f9f96b). 

Recently, the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) organized a [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation/overview) to tackle the detection and segmentation of this condition on chest x-ray images. We are interested in creating an open-source algorithm that uses this Kaggle dataset (initially) and other open datasets as well as chest x-ray data we have collected at Radboud UMC to detect pneumothorax. 

## Research question and tasks
Detection and segmentation of pneumothorax in chest x-rays. 

### Tasks
* Research previous work on segmentation of 2D medical images
* Research previous work on pneumothorax detection
* Develop a deep learning method that tackles the task
* Issue late submissions in [the leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation/) and compare model performance with winning submissions
* Test your model on data from different institutions
* Publish your algorithm under an open source license

## Innovation
The goal is to integrate the algorithm in a set of chest x-ray analysis algorithms that are tested in routine clinical care at the Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine at Radboud UMC.

## Requirements

- Students in the final year of a study in computer science, artificial intelligence, physics, or a related area.
- Knowledge of and experience with deep learning image analysis. You should sufficiently proficient to be able to implement systems described in [this book](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python). 

## Information

- Project duration: 6 months
- Location: Radboud University Medical Center
