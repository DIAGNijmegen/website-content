description: The Computational Pathology Group (CPG) is currently seeking two postdoctoral researchers, for projects focusing on transplant kidney biopsy analysis, and prostate cancer grading. Will you join our ambitious team? 

## Job description
Diagnostic pathology involves microscopic evaluation of human tissues. Increasingly, microscopic images are digitized to support the diagnostic workflow. This rapidly growing field of ‘digital pathology’ also yields ample opportunities for application of machine learning algorithms. State-of-the-art deep learning methods have recently been proven capable of supporting the diagnostic work of pathologists. We have now reached the point where such algorithms have performance comparable to experienced pathologists for specific tasks.

This position may, depending on performance and an extensive evaluation procedure, lead to a tenure track position within Radboudumc.

## Profile

* You should be a creative and enthusiastic researcher with a PhD degree in a relevant field, such as medical image analysis, computer vision, or machine learning.
* You should have a clear interest to develop image analysis algorithms within the clinical setting of a University Medical Center (i.e., have affinity with medical topics).
* Good communication skills, enjoying working in a multidisciplinary team and supervising PhD students. 
* Expertise in software development, preferably in Python.

## We offer

We are looking for two postdoc's and we can offer two different contracts:

* One contract for two years. In the first year you work an average of 36 hours a week and in the second year you work an average of 9 hours a week.

## Organisation

The [Computational Pathology Group](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/) is a research group of the department of [Pathology](https://www.radboudumc.nl/afdelingen/pathologie) of the Radboud University Medical Center. We are part of the interdepartmental [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) (DIAG). We develop, validate and deploy novel medical image analysis methods, usually based on machine learning technology and focusing on computer-aided diagnosis. Application areas include diagnostics and prognostics of breast, prostate and colon cancer. Our group is among the international front runners in the field, witnessed for instance by the highly successful [CAMELYON](https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/) and [PANDA](https://panda.grand-challenge.org/) grand challenges which we organized. We closely collaborate with clinicians and industry.
