description: Postdoctoral position for developing, validating, and implementing AI-based analysis models to assess safety of Oral Polio Vaccines

## Job description
Our Computational Pathology Group at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen (Netherlands) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher. You will work in a project funded by the Gates Foundation, in which we will develop, validate and implement analysis models based on artificial intelligence to assess safety of Oral Polio Vaccines. The study will be carried out in collaboration with partners in Indonesia and the USA.

## Tasks and responsibilities
This position involves a detailed analysis of the requirements, planning and development of artificial intelligence models using state-of-the-art architectures, and model validation and implementation. As a postdoc, you will also be responsible for project coordination, communication with collaborators, and possibly managing the data acquisition and storage pipelines.

It is possible to work partly from home, but we require all our team members to be on site at least 2 days per week.

## Profile
You should be a creative and enthusiastic researcher with a PhD degree in a relevant field, such as medical image analysis, computer vision, or machine learning. You should have a clear interest in developing image analysis algorithms and an affinity with medical topics. Good communication skills and expertise in software development, preferably in Python, are essential. 

## Place of work
The Computational Pathology Group is a research group of the department of [Pathology](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/departments/pathology) of the Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc). We are also part of the cross-departmental[Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) at Radboudumc. We develop, validate and deploy novel medical image analysis methods, usually based on the newest advances in machine learning with a focus on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Application areas include diagnostics and prognostics of breast, colon, prostate and lung cancer.

Our group is among the international front runners in the field, witnessed for instance by the highly successful Camelyon, Panda and Tiger grand challenges which we organized. The group currently consists of some 35 persons, including PhD students, postdocs, data and project managers, technicians, and principal investigators.
