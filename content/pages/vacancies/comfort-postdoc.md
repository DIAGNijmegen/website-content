description: We are offering a PostDoc position on multimodal AI for urologic cancer

This PostDoc project is part of the European project [“Computational Models for patient stratification in urologic cancers – Creating robust and trustworthy multimodal AI for health care – COMFORT”](https://www.comfort-ai.eu/) which aims to develop and prospectively validate multimodal, AI-based decision support tools to improve detection, diagnosis and prognosis of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) and kidney cancer (KC).

## Background

Prostate cancer (PCa) and kidney cancer (KC) are among the most prevalent cancers. Europe sees some of the highest incidence rates of KC for both men and women in the world, whereas PCa accounted for approximately 23 % of all new cancer cases diagnosed in men in European Union countries in 2020. These cancers have a significant impact on the health and quality of life of those affected and place an increasing burden on our healthcare system, with costs exceeding EUR 12 billion each year.

Modern medicine generates a tremendous amount of structured and unstructured data (such as electronic health records, biomarkers, and complex medical imaging) that surpasses human analytical abilities, resulting in inaccurate diagnoses and ineffective treatments. Efficiently leveraging health data can reduce these burdens, but current clinical methods fall short in utilising the wealth of available data.

To address these challenges, the newly launched COMFORT research project is developing a cutting-edge decision support system. The innovative tool will use artificial intelligence (AI) and data-driven insights to assist medical professionals in delivering improved care for people affected by PCa or KC.

## Job description
The goal of this PostDoc project is to create AI-based models for PCa and KC which incorporate multi-modal complex health data from multiple sources such as image data, laboratory examinations, and unstructured medical reports.
