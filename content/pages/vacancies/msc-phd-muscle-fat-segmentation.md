description: Develop deep learning algorithms for segmentation of muscles and fat tissue in 3D CT and MR images.

## Clinical problem
The composition of the body in terms of muscle and fat mass is a precise measure of the physical state of the patient. This information has many practical applications in clinical routine care, such as monitoring treatment response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy in patients with cancer, or predicting clinical outcomes in other patients. While every hospital routinely acquires hundreds of cross-sectional imaging studies (CT and MRI scans) every day that would be suitable for deriving precise body composition measurements, this potential currently remains unused. Measuring fat and muscle mass would require manually delineating tissues depicted in the scan, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming.

## Aim of the project
Your task is to develop deep learning algorithms for automatic delineation of fat and muscle compartments in 3D CT and MRI scans. Next to semantic segmentation in medical images, this involves finding solutions for practical challenges, such as efficient data annotation, automatic recognition of suitable scans, and extrapolation in scans with incompletely depicted body parts.

In collaboration with [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/) and the [Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis](https://www.jeroenboschziekenhuis.nl/), this project provides the opportunity to continue your research beyond a MSc thesis and also obtain a PhD degree. The project consists of a 6-months research project at the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](https://diagnijmegen.nl/) at Radboudumc, followed by a 6-months international internship at Siemens Healthineers' campus in Princeton in the United States. After defending your MSc thesis, you continue the project at Radboudumc as PhD candidate with the aim to obtain the PhD degree after 3 years.

## Requirements
- Student in the final year of a Master study in biomedical engineering or technical medicine, computer science, data science, artificial intelligence or a related area.
- Good programming skills are important
- Experience with medical images is a plus
