description: Develop deep learning algorithms for segmentation of muscles and fat tissue in 3D CT and MR images.

## Clinical problem
The physical state of a patient is relevant to many areas of healthcare. A precise measure of a person's physical state is his or her body composition, which entails the measurement of muscle and fat mass in the body and has been shown to impact clinical outcomes. Body composition measures have been associated with cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, COVID-19 outcome, osteoporosis, treatment response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and poor outcomes (such as overall survival, progression-free survival, postoperative complications, quality of life, and health care utilization) following surgery, trauma and cancer. As a result, there is increasing clinical interest in how body composition can be used to improve treatment and care.

Cross-sectional imaging studies (CT and MRI scans) from which body composition measurements can be extracted are routinely acquired every day in every modern hospital. However, deriving the body compositional information from these scans would require manually delineating the fat and muscle tissues depicted in the scan, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. This limits the widespread use of precise body composition measurements in routine clinical practice.

## Research question and tasks
Develop, train and test a deep learning algorithm that automatically outlines different muscles and fat in 3D CT scans. An important
aspect of this project is also the implementation as an easy to use web-app so that the software can be used by clinical researchers.

## Requirements
- Student in the final year of a Master study in computer science, artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, or a related area.
- Good programming skills are important
