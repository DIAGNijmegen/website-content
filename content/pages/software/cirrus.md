DIAG develops algorithms for the analysis of medical images. We put a lot of focus on facilitating the application of these algorithms in clinical practice and clinical research. For this, we are developing a workstation platform that can be used throughout DIAG, called CIRRUS. Based on this platform, different workstations are being developed for, such as CIRRUS Lung Screening and CIRRUS Oncology.
The workstation is based on the MeVisLab software platform and is available through research collaboration agreements.

#### Features

- Fully web-compatible and can be opened from all standard internet browsers
- Automatic prefetching of next cases in the worklist
- Seamless integation of AI algorithm results
- Reporting engine for creating structured reports that can be exported to PDF or sent to PACS
