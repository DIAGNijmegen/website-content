Farbod Khoraminia studied Biomedical Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology. Currently a PhD candidate at Erasmus MC, Farbod is working on a project funded by the EU called [CLARIFY](https://www.clarify-project.eu/), which focuses on computational pathology for skin, breast, and bladder cancer. The primary research focus is on bladder cancer, particularly on developing prognostic tools. Farbod is working on two projects using deep learning to predict molecular subtypes from histology images, and another that predicts the risk of cancer progression based on transcriptomic data. The work is guided by a team of clinical and technical supervisors: Tahlita Zuiverloon, Chris Bangma, Arno van Leenders, [member/nadieh-khalili], and [member/geert-litjens].
