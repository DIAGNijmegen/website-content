Luc Evers is a scientific researcher at the Radboudumc Center of Expertise for Parkinson & Movement Disorders and the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG). Since 2023, Luc leads the AI for Parkinson lab (https://icai.ai/icai-labs/ai-for-parkinson), a multidisciplinary research group combining neurology and AI research to create remote monitoring tools for people with Parkinsonâ€™s disease. The AI for Parkinson Lab is a public-private collaboration between Radboudumc, Verily and Radboud University, and part of the Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence (ICAI) network. 

Luc studied medicine at the Radboud University and the Honours Academy of Medical Sciences. During his PhD at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour and the Radboud Institute for Computing and Information Sciences, he specialized in machine learning and signal processing, with projects varying from the development of algorithms to using wearable sensors to inform people with PD and their healthcare providers. Key contributions include the creation of a new reference dataset capturing free-living behavior at home, and the development of novel methods to quantify gait and tremor in real-life.
