Sanyog was a MSc student that conducted his master thesis research at DIAG between September 2022 and April 2023. His Masterâ€™s thesis focused on
[Automatic classification and segmentation of subsolid pulmonary nodules using deep learning](https://www.ai-for-health.nl/projects/subsolid_nodule_segmentation/) under the supervision of [member/colin-jacobs] and [member/kiran-vaidhya-venkadesh].
Among the different types of nodules, subsolid pulmonary nodules are routinely encountered in screening and carry a higher malignancy risk.
The goal of the project is to develop a deep learning model able to classify and segment subsolid nodules.
This will help in tracking the evolution of solid core of these nodules as the medical decisions are based on accurate volumetric behavior and growth of solid core.

Before his MSc thesis project, Sanyog did a research internship at DIAG focused on [automatic landmark detection on lateral headplates for orthodontic diagnosis](https://www.ai-for-health.nl/projects/facial-landmark-detection/), under the supervision of [member/silvan-quax] and Frits Rangel. He did his Bacherlor's in information technology at [Sinhgad Institute](http://cms.sinhgad.edu/sinhgad_engineering_institutes/skncoe_vadgaon/institute_details.aspx).
After completing the Intelligent systems in medical imaging (ISMI) course during his masters, he gained interest in medical domain and specially in cancer research and diagnosis. Which led him to work with DIAG and his motivation to do a thesis on lung nodule segmentation.
