Joske van der Zande (1998) commenced her role as a PhD candidate in December 2023 within the [CARA Lab](https://www.cara-ai-lab.nl/) â€” a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration between Radboudumc, Amsterdam UMC, and Abbott. She earned her Master's degree in Technical Medicine from the University of Twente, specializing in Medical Sensing and Stimulation. Her thesis focused on the assessment of commercial single-lead ECGs for cardiac screening. This research served as a follow-up to her second Master's degree obtained in 2021 at the Lyric Institute in Bordeaux, in collaboration with the University of Bordeaux, with a focus on Cardiac EP - Electromechanical Heart Diseases.

Throughout her academic journey, she developed a passion for the implementation of technology and algorithms in healthcare, specifically integrating AI in the cardiology department. During her PhD, she will be actively involved in integrating novel AI algorithms for real-time analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the coronary arteries acquired during cardiac catheterization procedures. Her work aims to bridge the gap between AI technology and clinical practice by enhancing the output of AI models, with a focus on aspects such as interpretability, reliability, and trustworthiness. Additionally, she will conduct qualitative research to gain valuable insights into the perspectives of patients and clinicians, promoting a comprehensive understanding of their perceptions and needs. Her research is supervised by Niels van Royen, Tobias Blanke, and  [member/jos-thannhauser].
