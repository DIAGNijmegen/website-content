Lisa Klok is a PhD Candidate at the Medical Imaging department of Radboudumc, where she works in the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/). She joined the [MERAI lab](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/projects/merai/), an ICAI Lab in partnership with Radboudumc and [MeVis Medical Solutions](https://www.mevis.de), under the guidance of [Mathias Prokop](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/mathias-prokop/) and [Colin Jacobs](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/colin-jacobs/), in January 2024. Her research focuses on developing deep learning models for the automated detection of incidental findings in low dose lung CT scans.

Lisa holds a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from TU Eindhoven and a Master's degree in Forensic Science (cum Laude) from the University of Amsterdam. During her Master's program, she concentrated on the application of medical imaging modalities for forensic purposes. Her literature thesis explored the use of radiography versus CT in detecting fractures indicative of child abuse. Her Master's thesis was dedicated to developing an algorithm for extracting fingerprints from Optical Coherence Tomography scans. Following this, she joined the Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital in Tilburg as an application analyst for the Electronic Health Record (EHR).
