Edwin John is a Master's student in Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence, with a strong interest in the reliability of AI systems in clinical applications. From September 15, 2025, he will be joining the Department of Medical Imaging Group at Radboud University Medical Center for his internship under the supervision of [Lisa Klok](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/lisa-klok/) and [Colin Jacobs](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/colin-jacobs/). 
His project focuses on the challenges of lung lobe segmentation in CT imaging. The research involves an extensive evaluation of state of the art, open source algorithms, such as TotalSegmentator, and a direct comparison to the department's in-house segmentation tool. Edwin aims to contribute to the development and evaluation of reliable AI solutions for downstream clinical applications like emphysema quantification and lung nodule localization; by analyzing the impact of pathologies on segmentation performance and assessing the integration of these models into AI pipelines.
