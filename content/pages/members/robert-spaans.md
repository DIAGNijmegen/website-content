Robert Spaans is a PhD candidate at the Computational Pathology Group (CPG) at Radboud University Medical Center, working under the supervision of [member/geert-litjens] and [member/nadieh-khalili]. Robert earned his masterâ€™s degree in Technical Medicine from the University of Twente in September 2024, specializing in medical imaging and interventions. During his graduation thesis, he investigated the applicability of three-dimensional technology for robotic surgery of renal cancer at the Urology Department of St. Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein, integrating three-dimensional models of urological anatomy for preoperative planning of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy and renal cell carcinoma complexity quantification.

Starting in October 2024, Robert will conduct research at the CPG in collaboration with the Department of Urology at Canisius Wilhelmina Hospital, Nijmegen. His focus will be on improving the assessment of adverse histopathology on multi-parametric prostate MRI using AI and radiology-pathology fusion.
