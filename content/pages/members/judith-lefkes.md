Judith pursued a double-degree master's program in Cognitive Neuroscience, specializing in Neural Computation and Neurotechnology, as well as Artificial Intelligence at Radboud University. Her master's thesis research took place at the Fraunhofer Heinrich-Hertz-Institute in Berlin, where she delved into the intersection of predictive uncertainty and the explainability of deep learning models applied to medical imaging. Starting in October 2023, Judith joined the Computational Pathology Group, working under the supervision of [member/geert-litjens]. In her role within the AIS-CaP project, she will focus on developing multi-task neural network architectures that facilitate pan-task feature learning while placing a strong emphasis on enhancing explainability and transparency.
