Adam Farrag is a Master’s student in Data Science at Radboud University, specializing in the application of artificial intelligence to STEM fields. Starting September 1st, 2025, he will join the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group for his internship, working on a research project under the supervision of [Dré Peeters](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/dre-peeters/) and [Colin Jacobs](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/colin-jacobs/). 
The project focuses on monitoring of AI algorithms for lung nodule detection and malignancy risk estimation, aiming to assess their long-term performance and stability in clinical practice. By investigating factors such as scanner variability and population shifts, he will identify conditions that may compromise algorithm reliability, ultimately contributing to the safety and trustworthiness of AI-driven clinical diagnostic tools.
