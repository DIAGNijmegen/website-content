Lenka Pacnerová is a versatile researcher with advanced quantitative competencies in medical planning and capacity management for healthcare establishments. During the PhD trajectory with DIAG, her mission is to engage with interdisciplinary teams on the AI adoption and implementation challenge. On a multicenter research project - Radboudumc in partnership with the Meander Medical Centre in Amersfoort, the Isala hospital in Zwolle and the commercial partner Annalise.ai, Lenka will evaluate the added value of AI products in radiological clinical practice (chest X-ray and CT brain). Under the supervision of radiologists [member/cornelia-schaefer-prokop], [Martijn Boomsma](https://www.isala.nl/specialisten-en-medewerkers/dr-m-f-boomsma/) and [member/steven-schalekamp], the aim is to deliver scientific evidence about the return on investment for these AI tools, together with quantifying workflow efficiency and quality of care. Besides developing decision support tools, Lenka has diverse experience across business operations in other industry sectors (IT services, clean room manufacturing). She pursued the healthcare specialisation of MSc Industrial Engineering and Management at the University of Twente (2023) and engaged with [CHOIR](https://www.utwente.nl/en/choir/) during/after the study period.

In the world of healthtech innovation, Lenka is a strong advocate of collaborative decision-making especially when approaching organizational change in hospitals or public health challenges.
