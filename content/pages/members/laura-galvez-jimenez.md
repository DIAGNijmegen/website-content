Laura is a postdoctoral researcher who joined the Computational Pathology Group in February 2026. She is currently involved in multiple research projects focused on cancer detection and prediction using computational pathology methods. Under the supervision of [member/jeroen-van-der-laak], her work centers on the prediction of vulvar carcinomas and the detection of ovarian cancer. Additionally, she is contributing to a project supervised by [member/francesco-ciompi], which focuses on the detection of tumor cells in gastric cancer. She earned her doctoral degree from Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in Belgium, where she focused on developing deep learning methods to handle imperfect annotations in digital pathology.
