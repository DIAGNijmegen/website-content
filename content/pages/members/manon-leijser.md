Manon Leijser is a Master’s student in Data Science at Radboud University. Starting on September 1st, 2025, she will cooperate in a research project as her internship. The project is focused on using AI models to integrate histopathological images and transcriptomics in the study of signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC). She will focus on exploring, visualizing, and preprocessing the datasets, implementing image analysis methods with deep learning models, and identifying similarities and differences between gastric and colonic SRCC. She will be supervised by [member/francesco-ciompi] and Femke Doubrava-Simmer.
