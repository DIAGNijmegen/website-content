Ruben van der Waerden (1997) is a PhD candidate at the CARA Lab as part of the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group. Ruben completed both his Bachelor Degree in Biomedical Engineering and Master Degree in Medical Engineering at the Technical University of Eindhoven. During his master, more knowledge and interest was gained on AI-applications within the medical scene. The focus of his master thesis was on the derivation of blood pressure out of the non-invasive photoplethysmogram (PPG) using deep learning models.

Since March 2023, Ruben works as a PhD candidate within the Cardiology department to focus on automated analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images during cardiac catheterization procedures, as a potential new method to assess the risk of myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease. This research is supervised by Niels van Royen, Ivana Isgum and [member/jos-thannhauser].
