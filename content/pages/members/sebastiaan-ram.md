Sebastiaan obtained his master’s degree in Data Science from Radboud University in April 2024. His thesis, conducted within the Computational Pathology Group, focused on developing a tissue segmentation model for kidney transplant biopsies, aiming to automatically quantify inflammation in different tissue compartments. Following this project, Sebastiaan remained with the group to work on the ANTONI project. Supervised by [member/geert-litjens], this project aims to develop large multi-modal foundation models for digital pathology, with the goal of creating AI systems that can serve as co-pilots for pathologists.
