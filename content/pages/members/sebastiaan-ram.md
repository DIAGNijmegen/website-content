Sebastiaan obtained his Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering before pursuing dual Master's degrees in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Radboud University. During his Master's program, he spent time abroad in Madrid, Spain, working as a researcher on the prediction of early-onset dementia using explainable models. This experience led him to become an ambassador for the International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART). In September 2024, he will begin his Master's thesis under the supervision of [member/linda-studer], focusing on developing a tissue segmentation model for kidney transplant biopsies, with the goal of automatically quantifying inflammation in different tissue compartments.
