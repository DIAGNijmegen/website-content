Frédérique Meeuwsen obtained her medical degree from Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in 2014. After graduation, she obtained a PhD in Biomechanical Engineering at the University of Technology in Delft, mainly focusing on monitoring medical devices to improve efficiency and workflow in the operating room. In 2024 she successfully completed the Pathology residency program at Erasmus MC (Rotterdam), after a 12-month specialization internship at the Computational Pathology Group in Nijmegen.
Currently, Frédérique is a pathologist and full-time researcher in the group. She was awarded a Hanarth Fonds Fellowship to become ‘a pathologist of the future’. During this two-year project she will work on the actual implementation of AI algorithms in clinical practice, the development of new AI (e.g. for glioma classification), and try to bridge the gap between medicine and technology. Supervision by [member/jeroen-van-der-laak].
 
She has an advisory role in the [COMMITMENT project](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/projects/commitment/), and the [DALPHIN benchmark project](https://www.compayl.com/dalphin)
