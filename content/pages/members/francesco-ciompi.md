Francesco Ciompi is Associate Professor and Research Group Leader in AI for Precision Medicine at the [Department of Pathology](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/research/departments/pathology) of [Radboud University Medical Center](https://www.radboudumc.nl/patientenzorg) in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

His main research focus is artificial intelligence for precision medicine in the area of pathology, with applications to discovery and implementation of predictive and prognostic biomarkers in immuno oncology, and computer aided diagnosis for large-scale digital pathology and multi-modal data. 
As a guest lecturer at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/en), he has been the creator, main teacher and coordinator of the Master's course Intelligent Systems in Medical Imaging.

Francesco obtained his Master's degree in Electronic Engineering from the [University of Pisa](https://www.ing.unipi.it/it/) in July 2006 and the Master's degree in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence from the [Computer Vision Center](http://www.cvc.uab.es) of the Autonomous University of Barcelona in September 2008. In July 2012 he obtained the PhD (cum laude) from the [University of Barcelona](https://web.ub.edu/en/web/ub/). In 2013, he joined Radboudumc as a postdoctoral researcher and since 2016 he is co-leading the [Computational Pathology Group](http://computationalpathologygroup.eu) of Radboudumc.

He is the receiver of several Dutch and European grants, including a prestigious [VIDI personal grant](https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/nwo-talent-programme) from the NWO to improve immunotherapy treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, the [AMMODO Science Award for Groudbreaking Research](https://ammodo-science-award.org/groundbreaking/winner/computational-pathology-group/) in the field of Life Science to work on foundation models for digital pathology, grants from the [Dutch Cancer Society (KWF)](https://www.kwf.nl), leading the high-risk project [PROACTING](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/projects/proacting/) and principal investigator of the COMMITMENT project, and from the EU, leading the work package on artificial intelligence in the [BIGPICTURE](https://bigpicture.eu) and the [ExaMode](https://www.examode.eu) projects, and leading development of AI for computational pathology in the [IMAGIO](https://imagioproject.eu) and [HEREDITARY](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/news-items/2023/met-ai-op-zoek-naar-verbanden-tussen-ziekten-van-darm-en-brein) projects.  

He is the main organizer of the MICCAI 2025 Lighthouse Challenge [UNICORN](https://unicorn.grand-challenge.org), of then [TIGER challenge](https://tiger.grand-challenge.org), of the [COMPAY workshop](https://www.compaysymposium.eu) and the [COMPAYL workshop](https://www.compayl.com) at the MICCAI conference, of the [DALPHIN benchmark project](https://www.compayl.com/dalphin), member of the [International Immuno-Oncology Biomarker Working Group on Breast Cancer](https://www.tilsinbreastcancer.org) and of the editorial board of [Medical Image Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/medical-image-analysis).
