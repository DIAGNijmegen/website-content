Francesco Ciompi is Associate Professor in Computational Pathology and Research Group Leader at the [Department of Pathology](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/research/departments/pathology) of [Radboud University Medical Center](https://www.radboudumc.nl/patientenzorg) in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

His main research focus is artificial intelligence for precision oncology in the area of pathology, with applications to discovery and implementation of predictive and prognostic biomarkers in immuno oncology, and computer aided diagnosis for large-scale digital pathology and multi-modal data. 
As a guest lecturer at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/en), he has been the creator, main teacher and coordinator of the Master's course Intelligent Systems in Medical Imaging.

Francesco obtained his Master's degree in Electronic Engineering from the [University of Pisa](https://www.ing.unipi.it/it/) in July 2006 and the Master's degree in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence from the [Computer Vision Center](http://www.cvc.uab.es) of the Autonomous University of Barcelona in September 2008. In July 2012 he obtained the PhD (cum laude) from the [University of Barcelona](https://web.ub.edu/en/web/ub/).
