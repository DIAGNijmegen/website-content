Siem de Jong is a PhD candidate in the Computational Pathology group since September 2023 and is supervised by [member/francesco-ciompi]. As part of the [IMAGIO project](https://imagioproject.eu/), Siem is developing AI algorithms to annotate higher harmonic generation (HHG) images of lung tumor in biopsies, resections, and metastases in lymph nodes for intraoperative decision-making. Siem obtained his Masterâ€™s degree (cum laude) in [Biophysics and Biophotonics](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/physics-and-astronomy-biophysics-and-biophotonics/biophysics-and-biophotonics.html) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en) and [VU Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en) where he applied deep learning to HHG images of human skin tissue for stress-strain curve regression, and pediatric brain tissue for tumor classification.
