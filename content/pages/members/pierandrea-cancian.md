He earned both his Bachelor and Master degree at the Politecnico di Milano. Prior to joining the CARA Lab, Pierandrea gained valuable experience working in both industry and research, where his primary focus was on Machine Learning and Computer Vision. His involvement in various projects ranged from the segmentation of histopathological images to the detection of external damages in vehicles following car accidents.

Since June 2023, Pierandrea works as a PhD candidate on the application of AI methods for the automated analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. The primary objective of his project is to enable real-time analysis of coronary OCT during cardiac catheterization procedures.
