Sander obtained his masterâ€™s degree in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/). His master thesis was completed in collaboration with [UMC Utrecht](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/nl), where he researched vision-language models for melanoma histopathology. In February 2025, Sander joined the Computational Pathology Group to continue his research in multimodal foundation models for histopathology at the Radboud UMC. Prior to joining the Computational Pathology Group, Sander worked as a Software Engineer, where he gained experience in developing software that incorporates Generative AI models. Sander's research within the [AMMODO project](https://ammodo-science-award.org/groundbreaking/winner/computational-pathology-group/), supervised by [member/francesco-ciompi], focuses on developing and evaluating AI assistants for clinical use by pathologists.
