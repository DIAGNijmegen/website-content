Geert Litjens is a full professor of Artificial Intelligence for analysis of medical images in radiology and pathology at Radboud University Medical Center and co-chairs the [Computation Pathology Group](https://computationalpathologygroup.eu/) within the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/). His work focuses on the application of modern machine-learning methods to oncological pathology. Furthermore, he leads and participates in several research projects bridging the gap between medical specialties, such as prostate and [pancreatic](https://pancaim.eu/) cancer. Last, he led the work package on artificial intelligence within [BIGPICTURE](https://bigpicture.eu/) for the first half of the project.

Geert studied Biomedical Engineering at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/) and completed his PhD on [Computer-aided detection of prostate cancer](/publications/litj15a) at Radboud University Medical Center. He worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [National Center for Tumor Diseases](http://tigacenter.bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de/) in Heidelberg, Germany, before returning to the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/). He has been awarded several prestigious Dutch and European grants and awards, such as the [NWO Veni and Vidi](https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/nwo-talent-programme), an [ERC Starting Grant](https://erc.europa.eu/funding/starting-grants), and a [KNAW Early Career Award](https://www.knaw.nl/en/awards/awards/knaw-early-career-award). He is a member of the [MIDL Board](https://www.midl.io) and on the editorial board of [Medical Image Analysis](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/medical-image-analysis). Last, he is a prolific organizer of challenges in medical image analysis, such as [PROMISE12](https://promise12.grand-challenge.org/), [CAMELYON](http://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/), and [PANDA](https://www.kaggle.com/c/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment).
