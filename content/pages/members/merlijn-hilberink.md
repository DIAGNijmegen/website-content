Merlijn Hilberink is a third-year Biomedical Engineering student at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (HvA). He is completing his internship at the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG) under the supervision of [member/jan-tagscherer] and [member/alessa-hering]. His project contributes to the [project/oncofuture] research line, focusing on automated detection of lung lesions on CT scans using the nnDetection framework. The aim of this work is to support more efficient and consistent tumor follow-up assessment by reducing radiologists’ workload and improving the reliability of lesion detection in oncological imaging.
