Joeran Bosma is a PhD candidate working on AI-powered data mining for cancer detection and deep-learning based prostate MRI reconstruction for diagnosis and intervention (part of the FastMRI project) at the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/), under supervision of [member/henkjan-huisman], and [Jurgen Fütterer](http://magic.radboudimaging.nl/index.php/Person?name=Jurgen_F%C3%BCtterer). 

Joeran studied [Physics & Astronomy](https://www.ru.nl/english/education/masters/physics-and-astronomy/) (specialization: [Neurophysics](https://www.ru.nl/english/education/masters/neurophysics/)) at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/) Nijmegen. From September 2020 – September 2021 he performed his master’s research internship at the [project/prostateradiology] group of DIAG, under supervision of [member/henkjan-huisman] and [member/anindo-saha]. He worked on the detection and classification of prostate cancer. Specifically, he developed an automatic labelling procedure based on radiology reports, to augment the training dataset and subsequently improve model performance.
