Erik Post is a PhD candidate at the AI for Parkinson Lab. His PhD focuses on the development of digital progression biomarkers for people with Parkinson’s disease. Under supervision of [member/luc-evers], Twan van Laarhoven, Tom Heskes and Bas Bloem, Erik explores the potential of machine learning applied to inertial measurement unit data as a means to find and quantify arm swing during gait in free-living conditions. 

Prior to his PhD project, Erik obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Econometrics from the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen and a Master’s degree in Data Science & Entrepreneurship from the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science. For his thesis, he researched cardiovascular risk in the general Dutch population using machine learning-driven survival analysis in collaboration with LUMC and Pacmed.
