Tongjie Wang joined Erasmus MC as a Postdoctoral Researcher in July 2025. Under the supervision of Dr. Tahlita Zuiverloon, he is developing artificial-intelligence tools to improve risk stratification for high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer using whole-slide pathology images. Tongjie earned his PhD in Biomedical AI from the University of Edinburgh (UK), where he created multimodal models that extract features from H&E slides, sequence-level mutations, and clinical records to predict glioblastoma outcomes.
