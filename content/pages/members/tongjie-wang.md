Tongjie joined Erasmus MC as a postdoctoral researcher in July 2025. Holding a joint appointment with the Computational Pathology Group (CPG/DIAG) at Radboudumc, he is co-supervised by Dr Tahlita Zuiverloon (Erasmus MC) and [member/nadieh-khalili] (CPG/DIAG) within the AI-PRECISE project and contributes to the CHIMERA multimodal AI challenge. His research focuses on extending the CHIMERA framework to improve risk stratification for high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer from whole-slide pathology images. Tongjie earned his PhD in Biomedical AI from the University of Edinburgh, where he created multimodal models that extract features from H&E slides, sequence-level mutations, and clinical records to predict glioblastoma outcomes.
