In 2020, she completed her PhD entitled [Tissue-based biomarker assessment for predicting prognosis of triple negative breast cancer: the additional value of artificial intelligence](/publications/balk20a). Currently, Maschenka is pathology resident, while working as part-time researcher in validation studies on automated breast cancer grading and prognosis. Her research interests focus on application of artificial intelligence in clinical pathology for improved diagnostics and prognosis, with a special interest in breast pathology.
