Maschenka Balkenhol obtained her medical degree at Maastricht University (MSc) in 2014. In 2015 she joined the [Computational Pathology group](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/) of the [Department of Pathology](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/research/departments/pathology) of the [Radboud University Medical Center](https://www.radboudumc.nl/research) in Nijmegen as a PhD student under the supervision of [member/jeroen-van-der-laak], [member/nico-karssemeijer], [Peter Bult](https://www.radboudumc.nl/afdelingen/pathologie/team-pathologie) and [member/francesco-ciompi] on deep learning for improved prognostics in triple negative breast cancer ([project/prim4bc] project). In 2020, she completed her PhD entitled [Tissue-based biomarker assessment for predicting prognosis of triple negative breast cancer: the additional value of artificial intelligence](/publications/balk20a). Currently, Maschenka is a pathologist, while working as part-time researcher in validation studies on automated breast cancer grading and prognosis. Her research interests focus on application of artificial intelligence in clinical pathology for improved diagnostics and prognosis, with a special interest in breast pathology.
