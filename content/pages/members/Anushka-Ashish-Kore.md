Anushka Kore is an AI Researcher at [RTC AI](https://rtc.diagnijmegen.nl/) within the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](http://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) (DIAG). Since October 2025, she has been part of the RTC AI team, working on a project in collaboration with the Prevention Hub at the Department of Primary Care, focusing on extracting and classifying lifestyle information from unstructured clinical notes to support prevention-related research. Her work involves validating and optimizing BERT-based natural language processing models, for lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol, and drug use. The project aims to enable large-scale, privacy-preserving use of lifestyle data from Radboudumc and the RTC Health Data GP database, improving how such information can be leveraged for public health and prevention research.
 
Prior to this, Anushka completed her B.E. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Mumbai in 2022. After a year in the biomedical industry as a Product Specialist, she began her M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering at TU Delft, specializing in Medical Physics.
 
As part of her Master’s program, Anushka interned at the [Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam (BIGR)](https://bigr.nl/), embedded within IGIT (Image Guidance in Interventions and Therapy) and the ICAI Stroke Lab at Erasmus MC. Her research focused on assessing the feasibility of using deep learning methods to automate occlusion detection in stroke DSA images. Building on this, her master’s thesis ["Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning for Vascular Occlusion Detection on DSA"](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:0b267432-2371-4665-bb7a-cda3a745ba15), publicly defended in August 2025, developed a deep learning framework for automatic detection of arterial occlusions in stroke DSA sequences, integrating spatio-temporal modeling with single-frame spatial networks.
