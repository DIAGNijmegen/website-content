Anoeska Schipper completed the Research Master's track in Communication Science at the University of Amsterdam in 2012 (cum laude). She worked 7.5 years at Deloitte in eDiscovery and Technology and Innovation, developing and implementing AI-based tooling such as text classification and anomaly detection.
