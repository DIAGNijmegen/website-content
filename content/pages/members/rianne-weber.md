Rianne is a PhD student working on the OncoFuture project under the supervision of [member/alessa-hering] and Ewoud Smit. In September 2024, she graduated with a master’s degree in Computer Science with a focus on Bioinformatics from the University of Leiden. During her master’s thesis at the Division of Image Processing at the Leiden University Medical Center, she investigated the clinical viability of neural field-based AI models to generate contrast-enhanced MRI scans from low-contrast scans. For her PhD project, she is working on the clinical validation of AI models to increase the efficiency of cancer diagnosis and follow-up assessment.
