Matthijs Luijten is a master's student in Artificial Intelligence at Radboud University, following the Intelligent Technology track. Before starting his master, he followed the AI Bachelor at Radboud University. In the Computational Pathology Group, he will be working on a project to automatically analyze the progression of White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH), under the supervision of Gemma Sol√© Guardia and [member/geert-litjens]. Classifying White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH), as well as transition zones from grey to white matter (which are visible in MRI), will provide novel clinical insights in the characterization of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD).
