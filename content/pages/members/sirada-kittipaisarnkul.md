Sirada is in the final semester of the Erasmus Joint Master’s Degree in Medical Imaging and Applications (MAIA). She is currently conducting her master’s thesis research at Radboudumc under the supervision of [member/geert-litjens]. Her project focuses on the Automated Detection of DRESS Syndrome, utilizing skin biopsy samples from patients diagnosed with either DRESS syndrome or low-risk morbilliform drug eruption. The research aims to develop and train an AI algorithm to identify distinguishing features between these conditions, with the hypothesis that AI can enhance diagnostic accuracy and serve as an additional tool in clinical decision-making.
