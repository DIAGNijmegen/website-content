Susu Sun is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the Machine Learning in Medical Image Analysis group at the University of Tuebingen. Her research primarily centers on developing interpretable machine learning methods for medical image analysis, with a broader focus on enhancing the interpretability and transparency of neural networks.

Susu started her Ph.D. in June 2022 after finishing her master's degree in information and communication technology at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. In February 2024, she started a research visit to the Computational Pathology Group, under the supervision of [members/geert-litjens], at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen. Throughout this visit, Susu aims to delve into the realm of interpretable machine learning applied to pathology data.
