Evgenia is a postdoctoral researcher at the Computational Pathology Group, working on the DoPredict project in close collaboration with researchers from VU Amsterdam and AmsterdamUMC. She is supervised by [member/francesco-ciompi], and her project aims to develop AI methods to analyze the eﬀects of multiple applied drugs on cultured biopsies of lung cancer patients and potentially identify optimal treatments for individual patients. She joined the Computational Pathology Group in November 2025 after completing a PhD in Computational Immunology at Radboudumc, where she developed the methodology for robust and interpretable spatial analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in multiplex immunohistochemistry images and applied it to characterize the tumor–immune microenvironment of salivary duct carcinoma. Before her doctoral studies, Evgenia earned a master’s degree in Data Science from Radboud University in the Netherlands and previously she worked as a software engineer in international projects.
