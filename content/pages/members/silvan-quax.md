Silvan Quax completed a [BSc in Physics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/department-of-physics/education/bachelors-programme) at the [University of Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en) and a [MSc in Physics](https://www.ru.nl/english/education/masters/physics-and-astronomy/) at the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/). He did a PhD in the [Artificial Cognitive Systems group](http://artcogsys.com/) of the [Donders Institute](https://www.ru.nl/donders/) under the  supervision of Prof. dr. Marcel van Gerven, where he investigated the mechanisms that modulate our perception using neural network models. In April 2020 he joined the [Radboudumc Technology Center (RTC) Deep Learning](https://rtc.diagnijmegen.nl/) as AI Scientist and Lab Manager of the [AI for Health](https://www.ai-for-health.nl/) ICAI lab and since January 2024 he is the coordinator of the [RTC AI](https://rtc.diagnijmegen.nl/). The [RTC AI](https://rtc.diagnijmegen.nl/) leverages the expertise of the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](http://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) in using machine learning, specifically deep learning, to analyze images and other medical data. The [RTC AI](https://rtc.diagnijmegen.nl/) functions as the main portal for all questions regarding the use of deep learning in the Radboudumc and can provide expert guidance and services for big data analysis and deep learning, specifically in the field of image analysis but also on predictive analytics in general.
