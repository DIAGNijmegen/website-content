Bogdan Ioanitescu is a Master’s student in Biomedical Engineering, specialized in Medical Image Analysis. Since December 5, 2025, he has been part of the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, where he works under the supervision of [member/stan-noordman] and [member/henkjan-huisman].

His research project focuses on improving the image reconstruction pipeline for real time MRI guided prostate biopsy procedures. The work involves investigating state of the art deep learning based MRI reconstruction algorithms, to support real time instrument tracking during MRI guided prostate biopsy. This has the potential to improve procedural accuracy through automation and to reduce dependency on operator experience.

In 2024, Bogdan obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Groningen, The Netherlands. He is currently enrolled in the second year of his Master’s program at Eindhoven University of Technology, where he further expanded his expertise in artificial intelligence applications for medical image analysis. His academic background bridges clinical and technical domains, with particular interests in MRI physics, image guided therapy, and AI driven medical imaging methods.
