Zeinab Rahmanifard obtained her Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Imam Reza University in Iran, and her Master's degree in Industrial Engineering from Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch. She is currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at Radboud University. For her thesis, she is working on automatic nodal staging in lung cancer patients with PET/CT imaging. The aim of this project is to develop an AI algorithm based on a lung cancer segmentation tool and an anatomical region detection approach that can accurately predict the N-staging of lung cancer patients using FDG-PET/CT scans. Her project is supervised by [member/lars-leijten] and [member/colin-jacobs], who are working within the [project/imagio] project.
