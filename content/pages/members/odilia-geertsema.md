Odilia Geertsema joined the Computational Pathology Group of Radboud University Medical Center as a PhD Candidate in February 2026. The focus of her research is the use of computational pathology to improve the detection and treatment of endometrial cancer, for which she is supervised by [member/jeroen-van-der-laak].

Odilia comes from a physics background with a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Physics and Astronomy from the Radboud University. During her Master's Thesis, she developed an artificial intelligence model for detecting and segmenting breast arterial calcifications in mammograms at ScreenPoint Medical under the supervision of Colin Jacobs.
