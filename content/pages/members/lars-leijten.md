As a Master student of Biomedical Sciences at Radboud University Nijmegen, Lars Leijten worked as an intern at the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl). He has finished his Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Sciences in 2019 at Radboud University. In his Master's degree, Lars has pursued a field where modern technology is implemented in medical practice, which he found in an internship at DIAG. The internship was part of the [AI for Health project](https://www.ai-for-health.nl) and focuses on generating a database of labelled and segmented CT scans of spines with realistic scoliotic curvatures. Using this database, a machine learning algorithm could improve the robustness in which scoliotic spines are automatically segmented and labelled for further medical applications. Lars started his internship at DIAG in February 2022 and remained part of the team up to and including July 2022. He was supervised by [member/nikolas-lessmann] and Dennis Janssen (Department of Orthopedics).
