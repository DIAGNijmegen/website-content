Jasper Linmans is a PhD candidate in the [Computational Pathology group](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/) of the [Department of Pathology](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/research/departments/pathology) of the [Radboud University Medical Center](https://www.radboudumc.nl/research) in Nijmegen. He is under the supervision of [member/geert-litjens]. He completed his Master's degree (cum laude) in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html?cb) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/) after finishing his Bachelor's degree in Biology at the University of Amsterdam. During his Master's thesis at [AMLab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/), he worked on generative approaches to translate data samples between the domains of images and text. During his Master's degree he was also involved with extracurricular projects at AML4Health and ILPS. One of these projects for AML4Health, was focused on applying rotational equivariant networks to improve existing algorithms for automated detection of metastases in whole-slide images of lymph node sections. During his PhD he will focus on uncertainty estimation for Digital Pathology using deep learning.
