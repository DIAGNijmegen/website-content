Shaurya obtained his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, at Oregon State University in the United States. During his Bachelor's, he worked as a researcher on algorithms to generate song playlists that gradually change in mood. He also completed a research internship at Carnegie Mellon University in that time, working on a tool which explained the behavior and biases of Wikipedia's edit moderation model to editors on the platform. This experience led him to pursue a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence with a focus on the Societal Impact of AI at Radboud University, as part of the Fulbright scholarship. At DIAG, Shaurya is working on his Master's thesis under the supervision of [member/fennie-van-der-graaf], [member/lena-philipp] and [member/michel-vitale]. He will evaluate the fairness of malignancy risk estimation models for lung cancer screening, and develop methods to mitigate their biases.
