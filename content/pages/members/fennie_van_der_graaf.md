Fennie is a PhD Candidate in the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group [DIAG](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) at the Medical Imaging department of Radboud University Medical Center. In July 2023, she joined [MERAI lab](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/projects/merai/), an ICAI Lab between the partners Radboudumc and [MeVis Medical Solutions](https://www.mevis.de/) working under the guidance of [Mathias Prokop](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/mathias-prokop/) and [Colin Jacobs](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/colin-jacobs/). Her research focuses on the development of deep learning models that can be used to automatically detect incidental findings in low dose lung CT scans.

Before joining [MERAI lab](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/projects/merai/), Fennie obtained her Masters in Biomedical Engineering (diagnostic imaging track) at the University of Groningen. She did her master thesis with Thirona B.V, in the field of cycleGANs for chest x-ray image augmentation, to improve a Tuberculosis classification algorithm. She then joined Thirona B.V. as a data analysis lead in the Chest CT team, and then worked at the UMCG Medical Imaging department as a project manager.
