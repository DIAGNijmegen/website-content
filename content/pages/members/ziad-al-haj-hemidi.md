Ziad Al-Haj Hemidi is a researcher with a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Medical Informatics from the University of Lübeck in Germany. He is currently pursuing a PhD in Medical Deep Learning at the University of Lübeck under the supervision of Mattias Heinrich. His research focuses on applying deep learning techniques to accelerate MRI acquisition and correct motion artifacts.

In July 2024, Ziad joined a collaboration with the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, supervised by [member/henkjan-huisman] and [member/joeran-bosma]. This collaboration aims to curate a diverse MRI dataset of Raw k-space data and launch an MRI Reconstruction challenge. Additionally, we aim to conduct a joint research project to utilize deep learning for motion-resolved accelerated reconstructions.
