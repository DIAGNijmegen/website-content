Peter Koopmans is an assistant professor at the [Radiation Oncology department](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/research/departments/radiation-oncology) and the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/). He is an MR physicist specialized in accelerated imaging and image contrast manipulation. His work is focused on acceleration of the workflow on the [MR-Linac](https://www.radboudumc.nl/afdelingen/radiotherapie/radiotherapie-in-het-radboudumc/mr-linac), a device for image-guided radiotherapy. Objectives include, fast A.I.-driven contouring of tumors and organs, A.I. driven updating of the radiation treatment plan, and manipulating the MR acquisition to both improve tumor visibility as well as temporal resolution, to benefit the treatment of tumors in regions prone to motion (e.g. abdomen). 

Peter studied Applied Physics (biomedical engineering) at the University of Groningen, with scientific projects on otoacoustic emissions, MRI of Huntington’s disease, and temporal stability and replicability of fMRI. He obtained his PhD in MR Physics at the [Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging](https://www.ru.nl/donders/research/theme-4-neural-computation-neurotechnology/research-groups-theme-4/mr-techniques-brain-function/) on the topic of fMRI of cortical layers. On a Sir Henry Wellcome Trust postdoctoral fellowship he worked at the [FMRIB Centre](https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/about/locations/fmrib) in Oxford, UK on high-resolution diffusion MRI and parallel transmission at 7T, followed by a 5-year Emmy Nöther fellowship grant of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft to work on layer-specific fMRI of pain perception as a PI at the [Erwin L. Hahn institute for Magnetic Resonance Imaging](https://hahn-institute.de/en) in Essen, Germany.
