Simone obtained his PhD in bioengineering at Politecnico di Milano. Over the years, he has worked as a researcher at Imperial College London, the National University of Singapore, and the University of Cambridge. His scientific interests include medical image analysis and numerical simulations, with a focus on data-driven methods for clinical applications. Some of his research projects involve 3D convolutional neural networks for medical image segmentation, implicit neural representations for image denoising and super-resolution, and automatic workflows for pre-procedural planning. Currently, he is working as an assistant professor in cardiovascular image analysis within [qurAI](https://qurai.amsterdam/) and [CARA Lab](https://www.cara-ai-lab.nl/).
