Paul Konstantin Gerke is a Research Software Engineer in the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](http://diagnijmegen.nl/index.php/Home) at [Radboudumc](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/research) in Nijmegen. He studied Artificial Intelligence at [Radboud University](http://www.ru.nl/english/) from 2006 to 2013 and specialized in the area of pattern recognition, computer vision, and robotics. He also has expertise in the area of 3D image synthesis and low-level programming (e.g. for microcontrollers).

For his master thesis, Paul Konstantin created an iOS-game for the European Space Agency [Astro Drone](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Technology/Smartphone_app_turns_home_drone_into_spacecraft) with which users can contribute to research by collecting visual data with a drone. The collected data are saved in a huge data base of visual features for later data mining.
