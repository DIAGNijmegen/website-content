Gabriele Lozupone is a PhD student at the University of Cassino, and he is currently a visiting PhD at Radboudumc. He received a Master’s Degree in Computer Engineering (cum laude) in 2023 with a thesis on LLMs and Transformer Architecture. In 2023, he began his PhD focusing on the research project “Analysis of MRI images using Machine Learning techniques to support the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and monitor their progression.” Specifically, he has worked on diagnosis and prognosis methods that employ Attention Mechanisms to enhance performance and ensure the explainability of results. Under the supervision of [member/henkjan-huisman], he is starting a new research topic to achieve explainability and predict disease progression through Diffusion Models combined with self-attention-based methods. His research primarily targets neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s Disease and Parkinson’s Disease.
