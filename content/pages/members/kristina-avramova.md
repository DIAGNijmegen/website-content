Kristina Avramova is a third-year Bachelorâ€™s student in Artificial Intelligence at Radboud University. She is interested in researching AI algorithms with applications in healthcare. She is currently working on her thesis within the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG) under the supervision of [member/colin-jacobs] and [member/fennie-van-der-graaf]. 

Her thesis centers around comparing the performance of scan-level and nodule-level algorithms for estimating lung nodule malignancy risk. This project has the potential to contribute to the understanding and development of reliable and interpretable malignancy risk estimation models, to improve the efficiency of lung cancer screening trials.
