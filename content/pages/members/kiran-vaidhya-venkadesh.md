Kiran is a PhD candidate at Radboudumc. He started working at the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) in November 2019. His research interests revolve around the development of deep learning algorithms for early lung cancer detection from chest CT images. He is supervised by [member/bram-van-ginneken], [Mathias Prokop](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/people/mathias-prokop) and [member/colin-jacobs] under [project/lung-cancer-screening] at DIAG.

Kiran obtained his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in the Engineering Design department at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), in 2016, with a specialization in Biomedical Design. He worked on brain tumor segmentation using deep learning for his Master's thesis at the [MiRL](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~gankrish/) lab. After his graduation, he worked at [Predible Health](http://prediblehealth.com/) for three years and developed deep learning solutions for medical image analysis.
