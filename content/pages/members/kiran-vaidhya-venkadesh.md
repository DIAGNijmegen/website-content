Kiran is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Radboudumc, where he focuses on developing AI algorithms for radiology. He works as a Fellow in the Life Sciences edition of the [NWO Faculty of Impact](https://facultyofimpact.nl/fellows-life-sciences-health/), and his efforts are dedicated towards advancing radiology AI from the research phase to clinical implementation.

In November 2019, Kiran began working within the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) as a PhD candidate, where he was mentored by [member/colin-jacobs], [member/bram-van-ginneken], [member/mathias-prokop], and [member/alessa-hering]. He successfully defended his PhD thesis on [AI for lung cancer screening](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/publications/venk24/) in May 2024. Following his PhD, he collaborated with [member/alessa-hering] on the [COMFORT](https://comfort-ai.eu/) project.

Kiran earned both his Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the Engineering Design department at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in 2016, with a specialization in Biomedical Design. His Master's thesis was conducted at the [MiRL](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~gankrish/) lab, where he explored brain tumor segmentation using deep learning. After completing his studies, Kiran spent three years at Predible, which later became part of [Nference](https://nference.com/), where he developed deep learning solutions for medical image analysis.
