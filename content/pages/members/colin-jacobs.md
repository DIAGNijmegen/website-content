Colin Jacobs is Associate Professor in Artificial Intelligence in Thoracic Oncology and Research Group Leader at the Department of Medical Imaging of the [Radboud University Medical Center](https://www.radboudumc.nl). His research group, part of the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, focuses on [AI for Thoracic Oncology](/research/lung-cancer-image-analysis/). He is internationally recognized for his work on AI in medical imaging, specialized in the field of lung cancer screening and early detection of lung cancer. He is a Principal Investigator in the [ROBUST AI programme](https://icai.ai/ltp-robust/), and director of [MERAI Lab](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/projects/merai/), an ICAI Lab that is part of ROBUST.

In November 2015, he obtained his PhD degree from the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/) in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. His PhD research focused on the [automatic detection and characterization of pulmonary nodules in thoracic CT scans](/publications/Jaco15b/). His PhD project was a research project in collaboration with MeVis Medical Solutions that has resulted in the release of [Veolity](http://www.veolity.com), an CE-marked and FDA-approvided medical device that is an efficient AI-enabled reading solution for reading lung CT scans. Colin is the (co-)organizer of several high-profile challenges in medical imaging such as [LUNA25](https://luna25.grand-challenge.org/), [LUNA16](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/) and the [Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017).
