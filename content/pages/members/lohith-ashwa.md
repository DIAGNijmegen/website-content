Lohith Ashwa is a master’s student in Data Science at Radboud University. He previously interned at Philips, where he worked on AI-based triage score models for ICU patients. In February 2025, he joined the Computational Pathology group to begin his thesis research. His work focuses on developing interpretable AI models to predict age and sex from bone histology slides and identifying the underlying tissue features that drive these predictions. The project aims to link these insights to histological characteristics, providing a deeper understanding of how bone microarchitecture varies across individuals. Lohith is supervised by [member/gerry-koons] and [member/geert-litjens].
