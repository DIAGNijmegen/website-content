Renate Dinnessen is a PhD candidate in the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) at the Medical Imaging Department of Radboud University Medical Center. She finished the Master’s programme of Epidemiology at Maastricht University and the Bachelor’s programme of Medical Imaging and Radiotherapy at the Fontys University of Applied Sciences. 
In August 2022, she joined the [project/amara] project. The goal of this project is to improve risk stratification of incidental and screen-detected lung nodules using AI algorithms. This will accelerate the identification of malignant nodules and limit unnecessary work-up for benign nodules, therefore improving the quality of life of patients and reducing healthcare costs. She is supervised by [member/colin-jacobs].
