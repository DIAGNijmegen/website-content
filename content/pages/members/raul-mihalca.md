Raul received his Bachelor’s degree in Computing Science, specialization Data Science, at Leiden University of Applied Sciences. During his Bachelor, Raul followed a pre-master programme at the Radboud University to prepare for the Computing Science (Data Science) Master, which he is currently wrapping up.
During his Bachelor’s Raul has followed two internships (both in the industry); one focussing on creating a data mart including visualization of the data, and the other one on establishing a pipeline to identify the usage pattern of a transmission electron microscope application. During his Bachelor’s Thesis, Raul also worked part-time as a data engineer at a bank. Raul is also a teaching assistant for the text and multimedia mining course.
At the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/), Raul works on his Master’s Thesis under supervision of [Colin Jacobs](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/colin-jacobs/) and [Bogdan Obreja](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/bogdan-obreja/). The focus of the research is on enhancing nodule type classification by developing new deep learning models and performing data scale analysis.
