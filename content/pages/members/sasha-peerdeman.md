Sasha is working on the detection of lymphocytes in immunohystochemistry using deep learning algorithms at the Computational Pathology and Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, under supervision of [member/geert-litjens] and [member/khrystyna-faryna].

Sasha obtained her Bachelor of Science degree in Medicine from the Radboud University in Nijmegen. Before the start of her medical internship for her Master, she followed a minor about AI at the University of Amsterdam. There she learned the fundamentals of AI and how to code for data processing. She wants to improve the skills she has learned with an internship, before she continues her Medicine Master.
