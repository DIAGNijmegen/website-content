Eduard Chelebian studied Biomedical Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, specializing in medical image analysis. In September 2020, he started a PhD in Computerized Image Analysis at the Department of Information Technology of Uppsala University under Carolina WÃ¤hlby. He developed an interest on how deep neural networks learn and how knowledge can be transferred for different applications. In July 2022, he joined the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group of Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc) as a visiting researcher to continue studying the intermediate representations of convolutional neural networks in histopathological imaging.
