Miguel Fernandes received his Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from the Nova University of Lisbon in November 2017 (Portugal).
His Master's thesis reflected on the comparison and usage of multiple metrics of functional brain connectivity for automatic classification of patients with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. 
Until April 2019 he worked in the development of Artificial Intelligence techniques for brain activity data at the University of Lisbon, Institute of Biophysics and Biomedical Engineering.
In May 2019 he started a PhD at the Radiation Oncology department of Radboudumc, under the supervision of René Monshouwer. His PhD project is a result of the collaboration between Radboudumc, including the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG), NKI, UMC Groningen and international institutes: Institute of Radio-oncology, Helmholtz-Zentrum (Dresden, Germany) and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). At DIAG his supervisor is Jonas Teuwen. His work consists in the analysis of cardiac toxicity associated to lung cancer radiotherapy with Deep Learning techniques.
