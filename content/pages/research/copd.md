Computed tomography is an important tool to assess lung damage from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We develop AI tools for CT in COPD. [member/eva-van=rikxoort] was leading this research in a large group until she founded Thirona. Currently, research on COPD within DIAG continues in the Solve study funded by the [Dutch Lung Foundation](https://research.longfonds.nl/lung-foundation-netherlands).
