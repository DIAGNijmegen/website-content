Musculoskeletal diseases are responsible for more years lived with disability than any other kind of chronic condition. We develop image analysis algorithms that assist radiologists and orthopedic surgeons in recognizing musculoskeletal conditions early and in making well-informed treatment decisions based on quantitative imaging data. This research line is led by [member/nikolas-lessmann].

## Algorithms

Several algorithms that this group has developed can be tried on the grand-challenge.org platform:
