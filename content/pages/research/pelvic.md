DIAG has a research line on pelvic image analysis, led by [member/henkjan-huisman]. Prostate cancer is an important topic in this group, with projects on automated detection of prostate cancer with MRI and deep learning, and real-time decision support during interventions for biopsy and treatment. Other projects focus on pancreatic cancer and the detection of adhesions.
