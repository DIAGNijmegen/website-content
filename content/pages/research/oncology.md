Radiology departments make large amounts of CT scans of the abdomen and the thorax of cancer patients. Reporting those scans is time-consuming and difficult. We develop tools to speed up and improve this process. In this research line, we aim to develop, validate and deploy algorithms that assist in the interpretation of radiological imaging of cancer patients. This research line is led by [member/alessa-hering].
