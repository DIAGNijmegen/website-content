  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of deep learning (DL) models for prostate segmentation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depends on expert-annotated data and reliable baselines, which are often not publicly available. This limits both reproducibility and comparability.
   METHODS: Prostate158 consists of 158 expert annotated biparametric 3T prostate MRIs comprising T2w sequences and diffusion-weighted sequences with apparent diffusion coefficient maps. Two U-ResNets trained for segmentation of anatomy (central gland, peripheral zone) and suspicious lesions for prostate cancer (PCa) with a PI-RADS score of >=4 served as baseline algorithms. Segmentation performance was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), the Hausdorff distance (HD), and the average surface distance (ASD). The Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction was used to evaluate differences in performance. The generalizability of the baseline model was assessed using the open datasets Medical Segmentation Decathlon and PROSTATEx.
   RESULTS: Compared to Reader 1, the models achieved a DSC/HD/ASD of 0.88/18.3/2.2 for the central gland, 0.75/22.8/1.9 for the peripheral zone, and 0.45/36.7/17.4 for PCa. Compared with Reader 2, the DSC/HD/ASD were 0.88/17.5/2.6 for the central gland, 0.73/33.2/1.9 for the peripheral zone, and 0.4/39.5/19.1 for PCa. Interrater agreement measured in DSC/HD/ASD was 0.87/11.1/1.0 for the central gland, 0.75/15.8/0.74 for the peripheral zone, and 0.6/18.8/5.5 for PCa. Segmentation performances on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon and PROSTATEx were 0.82/22.5/3.4; 0.86/18.6/2.5 for the central gland, and 0.64/29.2/4.7; 0.71/26.3/2.2 for the peripheral zone.
   CONCLUSIONS: We provide an openly accessible, expert-annotated 3T dataset of prostate MRI and a reproducible benchmark to foster the development of prostate segmentation algorithms.},

  abstract = {To examine the morphologic characteristics of focal fatty foci in the myocardium of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) at computed tomography (CT).Institutional review board approval was obtained, and patient informed consent was waived. Fifty-five patients with TSC (mean age, 37 years; range, 16-67 years; 22 male patients) who had CT results available that included at least the basal portions of the heart were included. Fifty-five age- and sex-matched control subjects without TSC were selected from a CT database. Images were reviewed for the presence of areas of fat attenuation in the depicted portions of the myocardium. Descriptive statistics and the McNemar test for case-control comparisons were used.CT results demonstrated foci of fat attenuation within the myocardium in 35 (64\%) of 55 patients with TSC. Foci were well circumscribed and focal and located in the interventricular septum, left ventricle wall, right ventricle wall, and papillary muscles. Size varied between 3 x 1 mm and 62 x 31 mm. Multiple lesions were seen in 19 patients. In the control group, only one (2\%) lesion with fat attenuation was found (P < .001). Its linear shape and subendocardial location in the left ventricular wall differed from the morphology of fatty foci seen in patients with TSC.Despite incomplete depiction of the heart with CT, the majority of patients with TSC demonstrated well-circumscribed foci of fat attenuation in the myocardium that were not present in age- and sex-matched control subjects. This suggests that such fatty foci may be another characteristic of TSC.},

  abstract = {To investigate the prevalence of subependymal giant cell ependymomas (SEGA) in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study in a cohort of 285 patients with known TSC. Institutional review board approval was obtained. We included all 214 TSC-patients who had received a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain. The most recent scan was evaluated for SEGA and presence of hydrocephalus. Additionally, a literature search was performed, and pooled estimates of SEGA prevalence in TSC were calculated. We used descriptive statistics, two sample t-test, chi-squared-test, and meta-analysis as appropriate.Computed tomography showed radiological evidence of SEGA in 43 of the 214 TSC-patients (20\%); 23 of 105 men (22\%) and 20 of 109 women (18\%; P = .52). Average maximum tumor size was 11.4 mm (range, 4-29 mm). Patients with SEGA (mean, 31 years; range, 16-58 years) were on average younger than patients without SEGA (mean, 37 years; range, 10-72 years; P = 0.007). No association between tumor size and patient age was detected. Nine patients had bilateral SEGA. Hydrocephalus was present in six of the 43 patients (14\%). Meta-analysis of reported prevalence and our current study showed that studies using radiological evidence to diagnose SEGA gave a higher pooled estimate of the prevalence of SEGA in TSC (0.16; 95\% CI: 0.12, 0.21) than studies using mainly histopathological evidence of SEGA (0.09; 95\% CI: 0.07, 0.12).In our cohort, CT demonstrated evidence of SEGA in 20\% of TSC-patients. Prevalence of SEGA in TSC is higher in studies using radiological evidence to diagnose SEGA than in studies using histopathological evidence.},

  abstract = {We sought to examine the frequency of abnormal echocardiographic findings in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. In a retrospective cohort study, we included all patients with known tuberous sclerosis complex who had been sent to our cardiology department for echocardiographic screening from 1995 through August 2003 (n=56). Two research scientists independently reviewed the reports of the echocardiographic screening examinations for abnormal findings. We used descriptive statistics, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the chi(2) test. The mean age of patients included in the study was 35 years (range, 12-73 yr); 23 patients were male. Abnormal findings were seen in 22 patients (39\%). The most common abnormal findings were focal areas of increased intramyocardial echogenicity, which were seen in 16 patients (29\%). The clinical consequence of this finding is still unknown. We conclude that echocardiographic abnormalities are common in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex.},

  abstract = {Since 1995, the University Medical Center Utrecht is a nationwide referral center for patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Aim of this thesis was to make a start with the systematic evaluation of imaging in patients with TSC followed at our institution focusing on the heart, the lungs and the brain. In a case-control study, we examined the morphologic characteristics at CT of focal fatty foci noted in daily practice in the myocardium of patients known to have TSC. The fatty foci appeared to have unique CT characteristics consisting of a combination of focality, well-circumscribed form, location into the mid myocardium, pure fat density, absence of enhancement, and absence of invasive behavior. Because these characteristic well-circumscribed foci of fat attenuation were found in the myocardium at CT in the majority of patients with TSC (35 of 55 patients) and not in the control group, such fatty foci may help identify patients suspected of having the disease. Histopathology in patients with TSC showed multiple areas of mature fat cells in the myocardium without associated inflammation, without associated fibrosis, without entrapped myocardial cells, and without a capsule which seem to be unique for tuberous sclerosis complex. Adding these fatty foci in the myocardium seen on CT, MRI, echocardiography and histopathology to the list of major features of the current clinical diagnostic criteria for TSC may be considered in the future. In a cross-sectional study we reviewed the most recent CT scan of the lung bases for radiologic evidence of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) in a cohort of 186 adult patients with known TSC. Our study demonstrated pulmonary thin-walled cysts with intervening normal lung parenchyma in the lung bases in 28% of adult TSC-patients (52 of 186 patients). Gender specific prevalence was 0.42 in female and 0.13 in male TSC-patients. In another cross-sectional study we reviewed the most recent contrast-enhanced CT scan of the brain for radiologic signs of subependymal giant cell tumors (SGCT). Our study demonstrated radiologic evidence of SGCT in 20% of TSC-patients (43 of 214 patients). Gender specific prevalence was 0.18 in female and 0.22 in male TSC-patients. In addition, a meta-analysis of the reported prevalence in the English language literature, and our own study was performed. The resulting pooled estimate of the prevalence of SGCT in TSC-patients was 0.11 (95% CI:0.09, 0.14). The prevalence of SGCT in TSC was higher in studies using radiologic evidence to diagnose SGCT (0.16; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.21) than in studies using mainly histopathologic evidence (0.09; 95% CI:0.07, 0.12).},

In this paper, for the first time, a fully automatic approach for the detection of bifurcations in IVUS pullback sequences is presented. The method identifies the frames and the angular sectors in which a bifurcation is visible. This goal is achieved by applying a classifier to a set of textural features extracted from each image of an IVUS pullback. A comparison between two state-of-the-art classifiers is performed, AdaBoost and Random Forest. A cross-validation scheme is applied in order to evaluate the performances of the approaches. The obtained results are encouraging, showing a sensitivity of 75% and an accuracy of 94% by using the AdaBoost algorithm.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a fully automatic method which identifies every bifurcation in an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) sequence, the corresponding frames, the angular orientation with respect to the IVUS acquisition, and the extension. This goal is reached using a two-level classification scheme: first, a classifier is applied to a set of textural features extracted from each image of a sequence. A comparison among three state-of-the-art discriminative classifiers (AdaBoost, random forest, and support vector machine) is performed to identify the most suitable method for the branching detection task. Second, the results are improved by exploiting contextual information using a multiscale stacked sequential learning scheme. The results are then successively refined using a-priori information about branching dimensions and geometry. The proposed approach provides a robust tool for the quick review of pullback sequences, facilitating the evaluation of the lesion at bifurcation sites. The proposed method reaches an F-Measure score of 86.35\%, while the F-Measure scores for inter- and intraobserver variability are 71.63\% and 76.18\%, respectively. The obtained results are positive. Especially, considering the branching detection task is very challenging, due to high variability in bifurcation dimensions and appearance.},

  title = {Malignancy estimation of Pulmonary Nodules using Multi-View Multi-Time Point Convolutional Neural Networks},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Lung Cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths for both men and women in the United States. The aim of lung cancer screening is to detect lung cancer at an early stage. Majority of the time, after the lung nodule detection phase, only a small portion out of all the nodules that get detected turns out to be cancerous. Compared to traditional techniques that use handcrafted features and furthermore relies on tedious \& time-consuming prior lung nodule segmentation, the proposed method uses deep learning techniques in an end-to-end arrangement that performs both the feature extraction and classification directly from raw nodule patches. In this study, we focus on improving the pulmonary nodule malignancy estimation part by introducing a novel multi-view multi-timepoint convolutional neural network (MVMT-CNN) architecture that uses low dose CT images as its input. The dataset used in this study was taken from the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST)- which is the largest lung cancer screening trial known to date. We investigate the influence of whether adding temporal information of the same patient can help to improve the diagnosis. The proposed convolutional neural network architecture requires nine 2D patches- each of which represents a certain plane from the extracted 3D nodule patches. The nine planes are analyzed separately in parallel CNN streams and the output features coming from the nine different pathways are fused into one layer before passing it to the classification stage. Additionally, batch normalization and drop out layers are also incorporated in order to decrease the training time and reduce the chances of over-fitting. The average Area Under the ROC curve obtained after 5 fold cross validation along with bootstrapping were used to compare \& select the final best performing architecture. The robustness of the final selected model was examined and verified by swapping the time points to see if the network did actually learn to identify the growth of the nodule between timepoints. The proposed method confirms that using the proposed multi-view multi-timepoint CNN architecture improves the prediction ability of pulmonary nodules significantly.},

  title = {CT-based Deep Learning Towards Early Detection Of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma},
  abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the performance of a 3D nnUnet based algorithm for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)detection and assess the potential of the model for early diagnosis by conducting a subgroup analysis on small (size <2cm) tumors. Methods and Materials: Portal-venous phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) scans from a cohort of119 patients with pathology-proven PDAC and 122 consecutive patients with normal pancreas were included in thisretrospective study. For the PDAC cohort, expert segmentations of the pancreas and tumor volumes were available, alongwith the tumor sizes measured on the CT scan. For the non-PDAC cohort, the pancreas segmentations were obtained usinga pre-trained deep learning segmentation model. The pancreas segmentation determined a region of interest from the fullCE-CT as input to the 3D nnUnet.
   The network was trained for 1000 epochs with 5-fold cross-validation to differentiatebetween tumor and normal voxels. The predicted heatmaps were thresholded at 0.1. An image was considered a positivecase of PDAC if the predicted tumor volume was greater than 100 mm3. Results: The median tumor size on the PDAC cohort was 2.8 cm (range 1.2 cm - 9.3 cm). The detection task achieved anaverage sensitivity of 0.93 +- 0.04 (111/119), specificity of 0.98 +- 0.02 (119/122) and area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve of 0.96 +- 0.04. The median DICE score between the expert and the network tumor segmentations was0.68 +- 0.18. In 2 of the 3 false positive cases the network wrongly detected a hypodense region of the normal pancreas,which could be originated by fat accumulation or natural perfusion differences. The mean sensitivity in the sub-group oftumors with size smaller than 2 cm was 0.92 +- 0.1 (21/23), and the median DICE score in this sub-group was 0.56 +- 0.20. Conclusions: These preliminary results indicate that a 3D nnUnet based algorithm can accurately detect small tumors,suggesting that it could be useful at assisting in early PDAC diagnosis. Clinical Relevance/Application: Early diagnosis improves pancreatic cancer prognosis but requires significant expertise.An automatic tool for the detection of early-stage tumors would reduce expertise requirements.},

  abstract = {Early detection improves prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) but is challenging as lesions are often small and poorly defined on contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans (CE-CT). Deep learning can facilitate PDAC diagnosis, however current models still fail to identify small (<2cm) lesions. In this study, state-of-the-art deep learning models were used to develop an automatic framework for PDAC detection, focusing on small lesions. Additionally, the impact of integrating surrounding anatomy was investigated. CE-CT scans from a cohort of 119 pathology-proven PDAC patients and a cohort of 123 patients without PDAC were used to train a nnUnet for automatic lesion detection and segmentation (nnUnet_T). Two additional nnUnets were trained to investigate the impact of anatomy integration: (1) segmenting the pancreas and tumor (nnUnet_TP), (2) segmenting the pancreas, tumor, and multiple surrounding anatomical structures (nnUnet_MS). An external, publicly available test set was used to compare the performance of the three networks. The nnUnet_MS achieved the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 for the whole test set and 0.88 for tumors <2cm, showing that state-of-the-art deep learning can detect small PDAC and benefits from anatomy information.},

  title = {Towards Safe Clinical Use of Artificial Intelligence for Cancer Detection Through Uncertainty Quantification},
  abstract = {Purpose: Investigate whether quantifying deep learning (DL) models' uncertainty can help identify low performance cases that require expert attention. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included two use cases: pancreatic cancer detection on contrast-enhanced computed tomography and clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection on biparametric magnetic resonance imaging. The pancreatic cohort consisted of 242 (119 cancer) in-house cases for training and 361 cases (80 healthy, 281 cancer) from two external, public datasets for testing. The csPCa cohort consisted of 7756 (3022 csPCa) in-house examinations for training and 300 cases (88 csPCa) from an external center for testing. All tumor cases in the independent test sets were histopathology confirmed. The uncertainty of the proposed automatic cancer detection algorithms was computed using model ensembling. Fifteen DL models were trained with the nnUNet framework and integrated into previously established pipelines for each use case. The models were applied independently to the test sets and uncertainty was quantified in a case level as the standard deviation (sd) of the ensemble. Cases with sd lower than 10% were classified as having low prediction uncertainty, while the remaining were classified as having high prediction uncertainty. The mean and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for the high and low uncertainty groups were calculated. The permutation test was used to assess statistical significance. Results: The DL frameworks' performances for the uncertain groups were significantly lower than for the certain groups for both use cases. For pancreatic cancer detection, the mean AUC dropped from 98.0% (95%CI: 96.2%-99.8%) for the low uncertainty group to 78.0% (95%CI: 68.2%-87.8%) for the high uncertainty group (p<10-4). For csPCa, the mean AUC dropped from 92.4% (95%CI: 90.4%-94.4%) for the low uncertainty group to 65.7% (95%CI: 54.7%-76.7%) for the high uncertainty group (p<10-4). The low uncertainty groups included 41% of the pancreatic and 78% of the csPCa test sets. Conclusions: The proposed ensembling method can be used to identify cases where AI models' predictions are uncertain and show low performance. Clinical Relevance Statement: To be safely integrated in the clinic, AI can predict uncertainty and identify uncertain cases with lower performance that should be handled with extra care},

  title = {Air trapping on {HRCT} assessed by quantitative image analysis as an early predictor of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in lung transplant recipients},
  booktitle = ATS,
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {{RATIONALE:} {C}urrent diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ({BOS}) in lung transplant recipients by spirometry identifies the disease process after the point at which treatment appears to be effective. Earlier identification of BOS may allow improved outcomes. We aim to identify early predictors of {BOS} by quantitatively assessing air trapping in computed tomography scans ({HRCT}) of transplanted lungs. Previous studies of air trapping by visual analysis of {HRCT} were poor at early identification of {BOS}. {METHODS:} {T}he clinical {HRCT} images of eight lung transplant recipients who met spirometric criteria for {BOS} by {FEV1}, and who had the absence of infection and rejection confirmed by bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy within one month of spirometry, were reviewed. For each patient, the {HRCT} within one month of the spirometric diagnosis of {BOS} (visit 2) was evaluated. A previous {HRCT} (visit 1) at least two months prior to visit 2 and six months after transplantation was compared. Semi-automatic lung and lobar segmentation followed by quantitative image analysis were performed on the images of the transplanted lung at residual volume ({RV}) and total lung capacity ({TLC}). For each scan, previously published quantitative measures of air trapping were assessed: lobar volume at {RV} ({RVCT}), whole lung {RV/TLC} ratio ({RV/TLCCT}), density masks between -950 and -860 {HU} at {RV} ({DM}-950-860), median {HU} at {RV}, and 10th percentile {HU} at {RV} were computed. The changes in these measurements between visits 1 and 2 were compared using a t-test. {RESULTS:} {V}isit 1 scans were an average of 144 (range 42-243) days prior to visit 2 scans. The mean {RVCT} increased 52.53 cc (p=.48) and the mean change in {RV/TLCCT} increased 3.35% (p=0.47) at visit 2 when compared to visit 1. The {DM}-950-860 of the expiratory images increased by 0.48 % (p=0.78) from visit 1 to visit 2. Between the two visits, the average median {HU} at {RV} and 10th percentile of {HU} at {RV} decreased by 0.24 % (p=0.95) and 0.32 % (p=0.85), respectively. {CONCLUSION:} {I}n our small sample of lung transplant patients, we found that quantitative measures of air trapping seen at the time of spirometric {BOS} diagnosis were also seen approximately five months earlier. These measures may serve as an earlier marker of chronic lung transplant rejection; however, additional analysis of {CT} images over an extended period of time is necessary.},

  title = {The Medical Segmentation Decathlon},
  abstract = {International challenges have become the de facto standard for comparative assessment of image analysis algorithms given a specific task. Segmentation is so far the most widely investigated medical image processing task, but the various segmentation challenges have typically been organized in isolation, such that algorithm development was driven by the need to tackle a single specific clinical problem. We hypothesized that a method capable of performing well on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task and potentially outperform a custom-designed solution. To investigate the hypothesis, we organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) - a biomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a multitude of both tasks and modalities. The underlying data set was designed to explore the axis of difficulties typically encountered when dealing with medical images, such as small data sets, unbalanced labels, multi-site data and small objects. The MSD challenge confirmed that algorithms with a consistent good performance on a set of tasks preserved their good average performance on a different set of previously unseen tasks. Moreover, by monitoring the MSD winner for two years, we found that this algorithm continued generalizing well to a wide range of other clinical problems, further confirming our hypothesis. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms are mature, accurate, and generalize well when retrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance across multiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3) the training of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to non AI experts.},

Our approach objectively deals with staining variation and staining artifacts in immunohistochemically stained lung cancer tissue and is as precise as humans. This is evidenced by the low cell count difference to humans of 0.033 cells on average.

  title = {Automated Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Detection on CT Scans},
  abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) scans enable the detection of local enlargements in the abdominal aorta (AA), resulting to straight-forward quantitative and qualitative understandings, typically instated as abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Although, the segmentation of aorta is disposed to stall in presence of expanded lumen or intraluminal thrombus as a result of insufficient spiteful examples, raising the susceptibility for uneventful outcomes of an aortic rupture.
    The motion of this research proposes to develop and validate a fully automated deep learning algorithm to segment and measure AAAs on abdominal CT scans. The computer-aided detection (CAD) model is steered by a self-configuring convolutional neural network (CNN), which plumps for essential decisions in a standardised environment to design the 3D segmentation pipeline, regardless of the dataset diversity in the domain. It uses an additional 3D instance-based vertebral segmentation software bundle for independent vertebrae labelling. It coheres with a post-processing routine to perceive the growth patterns by investigation across the aortic centerline around strong anatomical landmarks. It benefits from supplementary measurement techniques of the maximal diameter and cross-section area for gaining extensive insights of the main characteristics of AAA. The system evaluates the relationship between the AA and vertebra level surface features. Conclusively, it generates a portable document, devised to group the anticipated aneurysmal information.
  The 3D CAD system agrees with expert's suggestions about the existence of the aneurysm in 398 institutional images, exhibiting a high capacity to generalize across genders and portions of a full body CT scan using solely radiologist-supported quantitative speculations from the radiology reports. The end-to-end routine achieves an 95.7% dice score coefficient (DSC) on the validation subset for patient-specific cases, indicating a modest agreement with radiologists within an average difference of 0.3 cm in the relative measurement of maximal AAA diameter, thus justifying the possibility of generalizing to the detection of aneurysms using report-based textual information only.},

  title = {Artificial Intelligence for the Classification and Quantification of Reticular Pseudodrusen in Multimodal Retinal Images},
  url = {https://www.euretina.org/congress/amsterdam-2020/virtual-2020-freepapers/},
  abstract = {Purpose:
      Reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) are retinal lesions highly correlated with the risk of developing end-stage age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and, therefore, relevant biomarkers for understanding the progression of AMD. Due to the subtle features characterizing RPD, multiple imaging modalities are often necessary to confirm the presence and extension of RPD, considerably increasing the workload of the expert graders. We propose a deep neural network (DNN) architecture that classifies and quantifies RPD using multimodal retinal images.
      Setting:
      A cross-sectional study that compares the performance of three expert graders with a DNN trained for identifying and quantifying RPD. Conducted on retinal images drawn from the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort, in three modalities: color fundus photographs (CFP), fundus autofluorescence images (FAF) and near-infrared reflectance images (NIR).
      Methods:
      Multimodal images of 278 eyes of 230 patients were retrieved from the Rotterdam Study database. Of those, 72 eyes showed presence of RPD, 108 had soft distinct/indistinct drusen, and 98 had no signs of drusen as confirmed by the Rotterdam Study graders. Delineations of the areas affected with RPD were made in consensus by two human experts using CFP and NIR images simultaneously and were used as reference standard (RS) for RPD area quantification. The data was randomly divided, patient-wise, in training (243) and test (35) sets for model development and evaluation. A DNN was developed for RPD classification and quantification. The proposed DNN is based on an encoder-decoder architecture. The model jointly inputs a set of co-registered retinal image modalities (CFP, NIR, FAF) and outputs a heatmap image containing, per pixel, the likelihood of RPD presence. The 99th percentile of the values contained in this heatmap measures the likelihood of RPD presence. Three independent graders manually delineated RPD in all eyes of the test set based on the CFP and NIR and their performance was compared with the DNN in the tasks of RPD classification and quantification.
      Results:
      The proposed DNN obtained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.939[0.818-1.0], a sensitivity (SE) of 0.928 and specificity (SP) of 0.809 for the detection of RPD in multimodal imaging. For RPD quantification, the DNN achieved a mean Dice coefficient (DSC) of 0.632+-0.261 and an intra-class correlation (ICC) of 0.676[0.294-0.999]. Comparably, for RPD classification, grader 1 obtained SE/SP pairs of 1.0/0.785, grader 2 of 1.0/0.5 and grader 3 of 1.0/0.785. For RPD quantification, the graders obtained mean DSC of 0.619+-0.196, 0.573+-0.170 and 0.697+-0.157, respectively, and an ICC of 0.721[0.340-0.999], 0.597[0.288-0.999], 0.751[0.294-0.999], respectively. Of the DNN's three false negatives, none of them was correctly classified by the three graders. The model correctly classified RPD in three of the six eyes where graders disagreed and in the only eye where none of the graders found RPD. Overall, 65.1% of the area indicated as RPD by the reference was delineated by at least one grader and only 26.5% of the total was graded as RPD by all experts. The DNN only missed 23.2% of the areas that all three graders identified correctly.
      Conclusions:
      The proposed DNN showed promising capacities in the tasks of classifying and quantifying RPD lesions on multimodal retinal images. The results show that the model is able to correctly classify and quantify RPD on eyes where lesions are difficult to spot. The probabilistic output of the model allows for the classification of RPD at different levels of confidence and indicates what retinal areas are most likely affected. This is in line with the manual assessment done by the graders. To this point, the model is developed to classify and quantify RPD only on CFP, FAF and NIR. However, introducing other imaging modalities, such as OCT, might help diminish ambiguities in the classification and quantification of this abnormality. Therefore, a future direction for improving the proposed method is to include OCT scans as an additional input to the model. Automatic classification and quantification of RPD using deep learning on multimodal images will enable the automatic and accurate analysis of increasingly large amounts of data for clinical studies and will facilitate AMD screening in the elderly  by decreasing the workload of the expert graders.

  abstract = {Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. While COPD diagnosis is based on lung function tests, early stages and progression of different aspects of the disease can be visible and quantitatively assessed on computed tomography (CT) scans. Many studies have been published that quantify imaging biomarkers related to COPD. In this paper we present a convolutional neural network that directly computes visual emphysema scores and predicts the outcome of lung function tests for 195 CT scans from the COPDGene study. Contrary to previous work, the proposed method does not encode any specific prior knowledge about what to quantify, but it is trained end-to-end with a set of 1424 CT scans for which the output parameters were available. The network provided state-of-the-art results for these tasks: Visual emphysema scores are comparable to those assessed by trained human observers; COPD diagnosis from estimated lung function reaches an area under the ROC curve of 0.94, outperforming prior art. The method is easily generalizable to other situations where information from whole scans needs to be summarized in single quantities.},

The tasks of the two-part PROSTATEx Challenges (the PROSTATEx Challenge and the PROSTATEx-2 Challenge) were (1) the computerized classification of clinically significant prostate lesions and (2) the computerized determination of Gleason Grade Group in prostate cancer, both based on multi-parametric magnetic resonance images. The Challenges incorporated well-vetted cases for training and testing, a centralized performance assessment process to evaluate results, and an established infrastructure for case dissemination, communication, and result submission. In the PROSTATEx Challenge, 32 groups applied their computerized methods (71 methods total) to 208 prostate lesions in the test set. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for these methods in the task of differentiating between lesions that were and were not clinically significant ranged from 0.45-0.87; statistically significant differences in performance among the top-performing methods, however, were not observed. In the PROSTATEx-2 Challenge, 21 groups applied their computerized methods (43 methods total) to 70 prostate lesions in the test set. When compared with the reference standard, the quadratic-weighted kappa values for these methods in the task of assigning a 5-point Gleason Grade Group to each lesion ranged from 0.24-0.27; superiority to random guessing could be established for only two methods. When approached with a sense of commitment and scientific rigor, challenges foster interest in the designated task and encourage innovation in the field.},

                              Methods: This prospective cohort study comprises 337 patients with an ischemic stroke or TIA, aged 18-50 years without a history of TIA or stroke. In addition 90 age and sex matched controls were included. At follow-up lacunes, microbleeds and white matter hyperintensitie (WMH) volume were assessed using MRI. To investigate the relation between riks factors and small vessel disease, logistic and linear regression were used.
                              Results: After mean follow-up of 9.9 (SD 8.1) years, 337 patients were included (227 with an ischemic stroke and 110 with a TIA). Mean age for patients was 49.8 (SD 10.3) years and 45.4% were men, for controls mean age was 49.4 (SD 11.9) and 45.6% were men. Compared with controls, patients more often had at least one lacune (24.0% versus 4.5%, p<0.0001). In addition, they had a higher WMH-volume (median 1.5 ml (IQR 0.5-3.7) versus 0.4 ml (IQR 0.0-1.0), p<0.001). Compared with controls, patients had the same volume of WMH on average 10-20 years earlier. In the patient group, age at stroke (beta=0.03 (95%CI 0.02-0.04) hypertension (beta=0.22, 95%CI 0.04-0.39) and smoking (beta=0.18, 95%CI 0.01-0.34) at baseline were associated with WMH-volume.
                              Conclusions: Patients with a young stroke have a higher burden of small vessel disease than controls adjusted for confounders. Cerebral aging seems accelerated by 10-20 years in these patients, which may suggest an increased vulnerability to vascular risk factors.},

  abstract = {{M}ouse models are becoming instrumental for the study of lung disease. {D}ue to its resolution and low cost, high resolution {C}omputed {T}omography (micro-{CT}) is a very adequate technology to visualize the mouse lungs in-vivo. {A}utomatic segmentation and measurement of airways in micro-{CT} images of the lungs can be useful as a preliminary step prior other image analysis quantification tasks, as well as for the study of pathologies that alter the airways structure. {I}n this paper, we present an efficient segmentation and reconstruction algorithm which simultaneously segments and reconstructs the bronchial tree, while providing the length and mean radius of each airway segment. {A} locally adaptive intensity threshold is used to account for the low signal to noise ratio and strong artifacts present in micro-{CT} images. {W}e validate our method by comparing it with manual segmentations of 10 different scans, obtaining an average true positive volume fraction of 85.52% with a false positive volume fraction of 5.04%.},

  abstract = {In this paper classification on dissimilarity representations is applied to medical imaging data with the task of discrimination between normal images and images with signs of disease. We show that dissimilarity-based classification is a beneficial approach in dealing with weakly labeled data, i.e. when the location of disease in an image is unknown and therefore local feature-based classifiers cannot be trained. A modification to the standard dissimilarity-based approach is proposed that makes a dissimilarity measure multi-valued, hence, able to retain more information. A multi-valued dissimilarity between an image and a prototype becomes an image representation vector in classification. Several classification outputs with respect to different prototypes are further integrated into a final image decision. Both standard and proposed methods are evaluated on data sets of chest radiographs with textural abnormalities and compared to several feature-based region classification approaches applied to the same data. On a tuberculosis data set the multi-valued dissimilarity-based classification performs as well as the best region classification method applied to the fully labeled data, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Az) of 0.82. The standard dissimilarity-based classification yields Az=0.80. On a data set with interstitial abnormalities both dissimilarity-based approaches achieve Az=0.98 which is closely behind the best region classification method.},

  title = {Potential of an AI-based digital biomarker to predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy response from preoperative biopsies of Luminal-B breast cancer},
  abstract = {Background & objectives: Invasive breast cancer (IBC) is increasingly treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Yet, only 15-20% of Luminal-B patients achieve pathological complete response (pCR). We developed an AI-based biomarker to predict pCR of Luminal-B IBC from preoperative biopsies stained with H&E.

   Methods: First, we trained a deep learning model on a multi-centric dataset of n=277 manually annotated breast cancer H&E-stained histopathology images to segment tumour, lymphocytes and other tissue. Second, we applied the segmentation model to an independent set of n=297 Luminal-B pre-treatment biopsies. For each case, we computed our biomarker: the proportion of tumour within 80mm distance from lymphocyte regions.

   Results: From the Luminal-B cohort, 32/297 cases (11%) were labelled as "pCR" when no remaining cancer cells were reported for the post-operative surgical resection. The biomarker showed significant (p<<0.01) correlation with pCR with a point biserial correlation coefficient of 0.27. Setting a cut-off value based on the optimal operating point of the ROC curve (AUC=0.69), we reached a sensitivity of 0.53 and a specificity of 0.74.

   Conclusion: The developed deep-learning based biomarker quantifies the proportion of inflammatory tumour regions. It shows promising results for predicting pCR for Luminal-B breast cancer from pre-treatment biopsies stained with H&E.},

  abstract = {Purpose: In this study we propose a new computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) to distinguish between malign and benign mass and non-mass lesions in breast DCE-MRI. For this purpose, we introduce new frequency textural features.
                             Methods: In this paper we propose novel normalized frequency-based features. These are obtained by applying the dual-tree complex wavelet transform to MRI slices containing a lesion for specific decomposition levels. The low-pass and band-pass frequency coefficients of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform represent the general shape and texture features respectively of the lesion. The extraction of these features is computationally efficient. We employ a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the lesions, and investigate modified cost functions and under- and oversampling strategies to handle the class imbalance.
                             Results: The proposed method has been tested on a dataset of 80 patients containing 103 lesions. An area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 for the mass and 0.94 for the non-mass lesions is obtained. Similarly, accuracies of 96.9% and 89.8%, sensitivities of 93.8% and 84.6% and specificities of 98% and 92.3% are obtained for the mass and non-mass lesions respectively.
                             Conclusions: Normalized frequency-based features can characterize benign and malignant lesions efficiently in both mass and non-mass like lesions. Additionally, the combination of normalized frequency-based features and three dimensional shape descriptors improve the CADx performance.},

  title = {Reference Tissue Normalization of Prostate MRI with automatic Multi-Organ Deep Learning Pelvis segmentation},
  abstract = {Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among male patients and second leading cause of death
    from cancer in men (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is
    currently becoming the modality of choice for clinical staging of localized prostate cancer. However,
    MRI lacks intensity quantification which hinders its diagnostic ability. The overall aim of this dissertation
    is to automate a novel normalization method that can potentially quantify general MR intensities, thus
    improving the diagnostic ability of MRI.
    Two Prostate multi-parametric MRI cohorts, of 2012 and 2016, were used in this retrospective study. To
    improve the diagnostic ability of T2-Weighted MRI, a novel multi-reference tissue normalization method
    was tested and automated. This method consists of computing the average intensity of the referencetissues
    and the corresponding normalized reference values to define a look-up-table through interpolation.
    Since the method requires delineation of multiple reference tissues, an MRI-specific Deep Learning
    model, Aniso-3DUNET, was trained on manual segmentations and tested to automate this segmentation
    step. The output of the Deep Learning model, that consisted of automatic segmentations, was validated
    and used in an automatic normalization approach. The effect of the manual and automatic normalization
    approaches on diagnostic accuracy of T2-weighted intensities was determined with Receiver Operating
    Characteristic (ROC) analyses. The Areas Under the Curve (AUC) were compared.
    The automatic segmentation of multiple reference-tissues was validated with an average DICE score
    higher than 0.8 in the test phase. Thereafter, the method developed demonstrated that the normalized
    intensities lead to an improved diagnostic accuracy over raw intensities using the manual approach, with
    an AUC going from 0.54 (raw) to 0.68 (normalized), and automatic approach, with an AUC going from
    0.68 to 0.73.
    This study demonstrates that multi-reference tissue normalization improves quantification of T2-weighted
    images and diagnostic accuracy, possibly leading to a decrease in radiologist's interpretation variability.
    It is also possible to conclude that this novel T2-weighted MRI normalization method can be automatized,
    becoming clinically applicable.},

Successful implementations in a variety of scenarios have started to demonstrate the cost benefits of digital pathology for both research and routine diagnosis, contributing to a sound business case encouraging further adoption. To further support new adopters, there is still a need for detailed assessment of the impact that this technology has on the relevant pathology workflows, with an emphasis on time-saving. To assess the impact of digital pathology adoption on logistic laboratory tasks (i.e. not including pathologists' time for diagnosis-making) in the Laboratorium Pathologie Oost Nederland, a large regional pathology laboratory in The Netherlands. To quantify the benefits of digitisation, we analysed the differences between the traditional analogue and new digital workflows, carried out detailed measurements of all relevant steps in key analogue and digital processes, and compared the time spent. We modelled and assessed the logistic savings in five workflows: (i) routine diagnosis; (ii) multidisciplinary meeting; (iii) external revision requests; (iv) extra stainings; and (v) external consultation. On average, >19 working hours were saved on a typical day by working digitally, with the highest savings in routine diagnosis and multidisciplinary meeting workflows. By working digitally, a significant amount of time could be saved in a large regional pathology laboratory with a typical case mix. We also present the data in each workflow per task and concrete logistic steps to allow extrapolation to the context and case mix of other laboratories.},

  abstract = {Aims: Most validation studies on digital pathology diagnostics have been performed in single institutes. Because rapid consultation on cases with extramural experts is one of the most important uses for digital pathology laboratory networks, the aim of this study was to validate a whole-slide image-based teleconsultation network between three independent laboratories. Methods and results: Each laboratory contributed 30 biopsies and/or excisions, totalling 90 specimens (776 slides) of varying difficulty and covering a wide variety of organs and subspecialties. All slides were scanned centrally at 940 scanning magnification and uploaded, and subsequently assessed digitally by 16 pathologists using the same image management system and viewer. Each laboratory was excluded from digital assessment of their own cases. Concordance rates between the two diagnostic modalities (light microscopic versus digital) were compared. Loading speed of the images, zooming latency and focus quality were scored. Leaving out eight minor discrepancies without any clinical significance, the concordance rate between remote digital and original microscopic diagnoses was 97.8%. The two cases with a major discordance (for which the light microscopic diagnoses were deemed to be the better ones) resulted from a different interpretation of diagnostic criteria in one case and an image quality issue in the other case. Average scores for loading speed of the images, zooming latency and focus quality were 2.37 (on a scale up to 3), 2.39 (scale up to 3) and 3.06 (scale up to 4), respectively. Conclusions: This validation study demonstrates the suitability of a teleconsultation network for remote digital consultation using whole-slide images. Such networks may contribute to faster revision and consultation in pathology while maintaining diagnostic standards.},

  abstract = {Extremely dense breast tissue is a risk factor for breast cancer and limits the detection of cancer with mammography. Data are needed on the use of supplemental magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to improve early detection and reduce interval breast cancers in such patients. In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial in the Netherlands, we assigned 40,373 women between the ages of 50 and 75 years with extremely dense breast tissue and normal results on screening mammography to a group that was invited to undergo supplemental MRI or to a group that received mammography screening only. The groups were assigned in a 1:4 ratio, with 8061 in the MRI-invitation group and 32,312 in the mammography-only group. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the incidence of interval cancers during a 2-year screening period. The interval-cancer rate was 2.5 per 1000 screenings in the MRI-invitation group and 5.0 per 1000 screenings in the mammography-only group, for a difference of 2.5 per 1000 screenings (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 3.7; P<0.001). Of the women who were invited to undergo MRI, 59% accepted the invitation. Of the 20 interval cancers that were diagnosed in the MRI-invitation group, 4 were diagnosed in the women who actually underwent MRI (0.8 per 1000 screenings) and 16 in those who did not accept the invitation (4.9 per 1000 screenings). The MRI cancer-detection rate among the women who actually underwent MRI screening was 16.5 per 1000 screenings (95% CI, 13.3 to 20.5). The positive predictive value was 17.4% (95% CI, 14.2 to 21.2) for recall for additional testing and 26.3% (95% CI, 21.7 to 31.6) for biopsy. The false positive rate was 79.8 per 1000 screenings. Among the women who underwent MRI, 0.1% had either an adverse event or a serious adverse event during or immediately after the screening. The use of supplemental MRI screening in women with extremely dense breast tissue and normal results on mammography resulted in the diagnosis of significantly fewer interval cancers than mammography alone during a 2-year screening period.

  abstract = {Our objective was to compare cathode ray tube (CRT) display with liquid crystal display (LCD) for soft-copy viewing of chest radiographs in a clinical setting.We displayed 80 posteroanterior digital chest radiographs side by side on a 5-megapixel CRT display and a 3-megapixel LCD. Gradation characteristics of both monitors were adjusted to DICOM display standards. Using a 4-point scale, seven radiologists ranked overall image quality and visibility of anatomic landmarks. Data analysis included Wilcoxon's rank sum test to assess the significance of preference for the different display modes and calculation of the percentage of images ranked equally by at least five of the seven radiologists.Wilcoxon's rank sum test found significant preferences (p < 0.001) for the CRT display for visualization of structures in low-attenuation areas of the thorax and for the LCD for visualization of structures in high-attenuation areas of the thorax. Overall image quality was ranked equal by at least five radiologists in 70\% of cases, whereas for the remaining images a significant preference was found for the CRT display.We conclude that, under subdued ambient lighting conditions and without use of windowing, for most images the overall quality is equal with high-resolution CRT display and LCD. In images judged preferentially, we found a significant superiority for LCD for delineating mediastinal structures and for CRT display for delineating structures in the lung.},

  abstract = {The prognostic value of mitotic count for invasive breast cancer is firmly established. As yet, however, limited studies have been aimed at assessing mitotic counts as a prognostic factor for triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). Here, we assessed the prognostic value of absolute mitotic counts for TNBC, using both deep learning and manual procedures. A retrospective TNBC cohort (n=298) was used. The absolute manual mitotic count was assessed by averaging counts from three independent observers. Deep learning was performed using a convolutional neural network on digitized H&E slides. Multivariable Cox regression models for relapse-free survival and overall survival served as baseline models. These were expanded with dichotomized mitotic counts, attempting every possible cut-off value, and evaluated by means of the c-statistic. We found that per 2 mm2 averaged manual mitotic counts ranged from 1 to 187 (mean 37.6, SD 23.4), whereas automatic counts ranged from 1 to 269 (mean 57.6; SD 42.2). None of the cut-off values improved the models' baseline c-statistic, for both manual and automatic assessments. Based on our results we conclude that the level of proliferation, as reflected by mitotic count, does not serve as a prognostic factor for TNBC. Therefore, TNBC patient management based on mitotic count should be discouraged.},

  abstract = {As part of routine histological grading, for every invasive breast cancer the mitotic count is assessed by counting mitoses in the (visually selected) region with the highest proliferative activity. Because this procedure is prone to subjectivity, the present study compares visual mitotic counting with deep learning based automated mitotic counting and fully automated hotspot selection. Two cohorts were used in this study. Cohort A comprised 90 prospectively included tumors which were selected based on the mitotic frequency scores given during routine glass slide diagnostics. This pathologist additionally assessed the mitotic count in these tumors in whole slide images (WSI) within a preselected hotspot. A second observer performed the same procedures on this cohort. The preselected hotspot was generated by a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to detect all mitotic figures in digitized hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections. The second cohort comprised a multicenter, retrospective TNBC cohort (n=298), of which the mitotic count was assessed by three independent observers on glass slides. The same CNN was applied on this cohort and the absolute number of mitotic figures in the hotspot was compared to the averaged mitotic count of the observers. Baseline interobserver agreement for glass slide assessment in cohort A was good (kappa 0.689; 95% CI 0.580-0.799). Using the CNN generated hotspot in WSI, the agreement score increased to 0.814 (95% CI 0.719-0.909). Automated counting by the CNN in comparison with observers counting in the predefined hotspot region yielded an average kappa of 0.724. We conclude that manual mitotic counting is not affected by assessment modality (glass slides, WSI) and that counting mitotic figures in WSI is feasible. Using a predefined hotspot area considerably improves reproducibility. Also, fully automated assessment of mitotic score appears to be feasible without introducing additional bias or variability.},

  abstract = {Much research has focused on finding novel prognostic biomarkers for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), whereas only scattered information about the relation between histopathological features and survival in TNBC is available. This study aims to explore the prognostic value of histological subtypes in TNBC. A multicenter retrospective TNBC cohort was established from five Dutch hospitals. All non-neoadjuvantly treated, stage I-III patients with estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer diagnosed between 2006 and 2014 were included. Clinical and follow-up data (overall survival; OS, relapse free survival; RFS) were retrieved and a central histopathological review was performed. Of 597 patients included (median follow up 62.8 months, median age at diagnosis 56.0 years), 19.4% developed a recurrence. The most prevalent histological subtypes were carcinoma of no special type (NST) (88.4%), metaplastic carcinoma (4.4%) and lobular carcinoma (3.4%). Collectively, tumors of special type were associated with a worse RFS and OS compared to carcinoma NST (RFS HR 1.89; 95% CI 1.18-3.03; p = 0.008; OS HR 1.94; 95% CI 1.28-2.92; p = 0.002). Substantial differences in survival, however, were present between the different histological subtypes. In the presented TNBC cohort, special histological subtype was in general associated with less favorable survival. However, within the group of tumors of special type there were differences in survival between the different subtypes. Accurate histological examination can provide specific prognostic information that may potentially enable more personalized treatment and surveillance regimes for TNBC patients.},

  title = {Tissue-based biomarker assessment for predicting prognosis of triple negative breast cancer: the additional value of artificial intelligence},
  url = {https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/220344},
  abstract = {Despite much research, currently still about 1 in 4 patients with TNBC will develop a recurrence after which the survival outlook is very poor. To date, no prognostic markers are available for TNBC to adequately stratify patients for the risk of developing a recurrence. The emergence of powerful computer algorithms, in particular deep learning models, enable more in depth and more extensive biomarker exploration. In addition, these algorithms are objective and reproducible, in contrast to most human visual biomarker assessment. The first aim of this thesis was to establish a well-defined cohort of TNBC, consisting of tissue sections, clinical and pathology data as well as comprehensive follow up data. Secondly, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the mitotic count, which has widespread clinical use as part of the Nottingham grading system. We studied mitotic count both via conventional manual assessment and automatic assessment, to see if we could find a cut-off value which is better tailored for TNBC. Our third aim was to evaluate the prognostic value of TILs, a promising biomarker not yet used in clinical practice.

     To study the prognostic value of biomarkers in TNBC, the following objectives were defined:
     1.	Establish a multicentre TNBC cohort including tissue sections and follow up data (Chapter 2)
     2.	Develop a baseline prognostic model for TNBC based on the currently known clinicopathological variables (Chapter 2)
     3.	Establish a computer algorithm (Chapter 3) which can automatically find mitoses in WSI of breast cancer, and validate the algorithm (Chapter 4)
     4.	Explore the prognostic value of the mitotic count for TNBC using manual and automatic assessment (Chapter 5)
     5.	Optimize the assessment of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes using deep learning and study its prognostic value in TNBC (Chapter 6)},

  abstract = {The tumour microenvironment has been shown to be a valuable source of prognostic information for different cancer types. This holds in particular for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a breast cancer subtype for which currently no prognostic biomarkers are established. Although different methods to assess tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been published, it remains unclear which method (marker, region) yields the most optimal prognostic information. In addition, to date, no objective TILs assessment methods are available. For this proof of concept study, a subset of our previously described TNBC cohort (n = 94) was stained for CD3, CD8 and FOXP3 using multiplex immunohistochemistry and subsequently imaged by a multispectral imaging system. Advanced whole-slide image analysis algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNN) were used to register unmixed multispectral images and corresponding H&E sections, to segment the different tissue compartments (tumour, stroma) and to detect all individual positive lymphocytes. Densities of positive lymphocytes were analysed in different regions within the tumour and its neighbouring environment and correlated to relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). We found that for all TILs markers the presence of a high density of positive cells correlated with an improved survival. None of the TILs markers was superior to the others. The results of TILs assessment in the various regions did not show marked differences between each other. The negative correlation between TILs and survival in our cohort are in line with previous studies. Our results provide directions for optimizing TILs assessment methodology.},

We describe the available data-base comprising of multi-center, multi-vendor and multi-frequency IVUS datasets, their acquisition, the creation of the reference standard and the evaluation measures. The approaches address segmentation of the lumen, the media, or both borders; semi- or fully-automatic operation; and 2-D vs. 3-D methodology. Three performance measures for quantitative analysis have been proposed. The results of the evaluation indicate that segmentation of the vessel lumen and media is possible with an accuracy that is comparable to manual annotation when semi-automatic methods are used, as well as encouraging results can be obtained also in case of fully-automatic segmentation. The analysis performed in this paper also highlights the challenges in IVUS segmentation that remains to be solved.},

  abstract = {An intraluminal coronary stent is a metal scaffold deployed in a stenotic artery during Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). In order to have an effective deployment, a stent should be optimally placed with regard to anatomical structures such as bifurcations and stenoses. Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) is a catheter-based imaging technique generally used for PCI guiding and assessing the correct placement of the stent. A novel approach that automatically detects the boundaries and the position of the stent along the IVUS pullback is presented. Such technique aims at optimizing the stent deployment. The method requires the identification of the stable frames of the sequence and the reliable detection of stent struts. Using this data, a measure of likelihood for a frame to contain a stent is computed. Then, a robust binary representation of the presence of the stent in the pullback is obtained applying an iterative and multi-scale quantization of the signal to symbols using the Symbolic Aggregate approXimation algorithm. The technique was extensively validated on a set of 103 IVUS of sequences of in-vivo coronary arteries containing metallic and bio-absorbable stents acquired through an international multi-centric collaboration across five clinical centers. The method was able to detect the stent position with an overall F-measure of 86.4%, a Jaccard index score of 75% and a mean distance of 2.5 mm from manually annotated stent boundaries, and in bio-absorbable stents with an overall F-measure of 88.6%, a Jaccard score of 77.7 and a mean distance of 1.5 mm from manually annotated stent boundaries. Additionally, a map indicating the distance between the lumen and the stent along the pullback is created in order to show the angular sectors of the sequence in which the malapposition is present. Results obtained comparing the automatic results versus the manual annotation of two observers shows that the method approaches the inter-observer variability. Similar performances are obtained on both metallic and bio-absorbable stents, showing the flexibility and robustness of the method. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

A prototype anthropomorphic breast phantom with inserted gold discs of 0.1 mm and 0.25 mm diameter was imaged with two digital mammography systems (system A and B) at four different dose levels. From the acquired processed and unprocessed images, signal-present and signal-absent regions of interest (ROIs) were extracted. The ROIs were evaluated by a non-pre-whitening MO with eye filter (NPWE) and by three human observers in a two-alternative forced-choice experiment. We compared the human and the MO performance on a simple detection task of the calcification-like discs in ROIs with and without postprocessing. Proportion of correct responses of the human (PC ) and NPWE (PC ) experiments was calculated and the correlation between the two was analyzed using a mixed-effect regression model. Correlation results including the goodness of fit (r ) of PC and PC for all different parameters investigated were evaluated to determine whether NPWE MO can be used to predict human observer performance. PC and PC increased with dose for all conditions investigated (signal size, processing status, and different system). In case of the 0.1 mm discs, for system A, r between PC with PC was 0.81. For system B, r was 0.93. In case of the 0.25 mm discs, r in system A was 0.79 and for system B, r was 0.82. For the combined parameters investigated, and after excluding the 0.1 mm discs on system A because the results were influenced by aliasing, the overall r was 0.81. Image processing did not affect the detectability of calcification-like signals. No significant difference (P > 0.05) was found between the predicted PC by the MO and the PC for all different conditions. The framework seems promising to be used in objective image quality assessment. It was found to be relatively robust for the range of parameters investigated. However, further optimization of the anthropomorphic breast phantom and investigation of other MOs for a broader range of image quality assessment tasks is needed.},

A set of DM images of an anthropomorphic breast phantom with and without calcification-like signals was acquired at four different dose levels. For each dose level, 200 square regions-of-interest (ROIs) with and without signal were extracted. Signal detectability was assessed on ROI basis using the CHO with various DoG channel parameters and it was compared to that of the human observers. It was found that varying these DoG parameter values affects the correlation ( r2 ) of the CHO with human observers for the detection task investigated. In conclusion, it appears that the the optimal DoG channel sets that maximize the prediction ability of the CHO might be dependent on the type of background and signal of ROIs investigated.},

Participating women get a mammogram consisting of four digital mammography (DM) images every  two years. These mammograms are reviewed by two radiologists independently. On the images, breast cancer- among other manifestations- can appear as low-contrast soft-tissue lesions or very small calcifications.

  abstract = {Tissue segmentation is an important pre-requisite for efficient and accurate diagnostics in digital pathology. However, it is well known that whole-slide scanners can fail in detecting all tissue regions, for example due to the tissue type, or due to weak staining because their tissue detection algorithms are not robust enough. In this paper, we introduce two different convolutional neural network architectures for whole slide image segmentation to accurately identify the tissue sections. We also compare the algorithms to a published traditional method. We collected 54 whole slide images with differing stains and tissue types from three laboratories to validate our algorithms. We show that while the two methods do not differ significantly they outperform their traditional counterpart (Jaccard index of 0.937 and 0.929 vs. 0.870, p < 0.01).},

  abstract = {Automated detection of cancer metastases in lymph nodes has the potential to improve assessment of prognosis for patients. To enable fair comparison between the algorithms for this purpose, we set up the CAMELYON17 challenge in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2017 conference in Melbourne. Over 300 participants registered on the challenge website, of which 23 teams submitted a total of 37 algorithms before the initial deadline. Participants were provided with 899 whole-slide images for developing their algorithms.The developed algorithms were evaluated based on the test set encompassing 100 patients and 500 whole-slide images. The evaluation metric used was a quadratic weighted Cohen's kappa. We discuss the algorithmic details of the ten best preconference and two post-conference submissions. All these participants used convolutional neural networks in combination with pre- and postprocessing steps. Algorithms differed mostly in neural network architecture, training strategy and pre- and postprocessing methodology. Overall, the kappa metric ranged from 0.89 to -0.13 across all submissions. The best results were obtained with pre-trained architectures such as ResNet. Confusion matrix analysis revealed that all participants struggled with reliably identifying isolated tumor cells, the smallest type of metastasis, with detection rates below 40%. Qualitative inspection of the results of the top participants showed categories of false positives, such as nerves or contamination, which could be targets for further optimization. Last, we show that simple combinations of the top algorithms result in higher kappa metric values than any algorithm individually, with 0.93 for the best combination.},

  abstract = {Modern pathology diagnostics is being driven toward large scale digitization of microscopic tissue sections. A prerequisite for its safe implementation is the guarantee that all tissue present on a glass slide can also be found back in the digital image. Whole-slide scanners perform a tissue segmentation in a low resolution overview image to prevent inefficient high-resolution scanning of empty background areas. However, currently applied algorithms can fail in detecting all tissue regions.
                             In this study, we developed convolutional neural networks to distinguish tissue from background. We collected 100 whole-slide images of 10 tissue samples--staining categories from five medical centers for development and testing. Additionally, eight more images of eight unfamiliar categories were collected for testing only. We compared our fully-convolutional neural networks to three traditional methods on a range of resolution levels using Dice score and sensitivity.
                             We also tested whether a single neural network can perform equivalently to multiple networks, each specialized in a single resolution. Overall, our solutions outperformed the traditional methods on all the tested resolutions. The resolution-agnostic network achieved average Dice scores between 0.97 and 0.98 across the tested resolution levels, only 0.0069 less than the resolution-specific networks. Finally, its excellent generalization performance was demonstrated by achieving averages of 0.98 Dice score and 0.97 sensitivity on the eight unfamiliar images. A future study should test this network prospectively.},

  title = {Additional Value of Brain {CT} Perfusion in The Detection of Intracranial Vessel Occlusion in Acute Ischemic Stroke: A (Multi Experience Level) Inter-Observer Study},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the additional value of brain {CT} perfusion ({CTP}) for intracranial vessel occlusion detection in acute ischemic stroke for observers with different levels of experience.

                             METHOD AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively included all patients with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke (onset of less than 9 hours) who were scanned with non-enhanced {CT} ({NECT}), {CT} angiography ({CTA}) and {CTP} in the year 2015. Four observers with different levels of experience (neuroradiologist, non-neuroradiologist, two radiology residents) evaluated the imaging data with 2 imaging strategies. Method 1 included {NECT} and {CTA}. For method 2, additional {CTP} maps were provided for the evaluation of intracranial vessel occlusion on {CTA}. The observers were blinded to patient identity and clinical outcome. Receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) was used for the evaluation of accuracy in intracranial vessel occlusion detection. The reference standard of vessel occlusion was set based on the evaluation by the four observers, and the judgment of an independent neuroradiologist serving as a referee in case of discrepancy.

                             RESULTS: In total 110 patients were included, preliminary analyses included 94 patients. There was an increase of {AUC} in the overall detection of intracranial vessel occlusion for observer 1, 3 and 4, though only for observer 1 the increase in {AUC} was statistically significant (p=0.041). Increase of intracranial vessel occlusion detection mainly concerned distal vessel occlusions. No significant added value of {CTP} was found for proximal vessel occlusions, with already a high accuracy based on {NECT} and {CTA} for all experience levels with sensitivity ranging between 86-94% and specificity between 92-100%.

                             CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the use of {CTP} can aid in the detection of distal intracranial vessel occlusions on {CTA} in case {CTP} is integrated in the reading strategy. It is also demonstrated that {CTP} was not of added value for the detection of proximal intracranial vessel occlusions. Finally, there was no major difference in the diagnostic accuracy of intracranial vessel occlusion detection for the different levels in experience of the observers.

                             CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: Our study demonstrated that brain {CT} perfusion can aid in the detection of distal intracranial vessel occlusions, which is clinically relevant for optimizing the imaging strategy in acute ischemic stroke.},

                             Materials and methods: Medical-ethical committee approval of our hospital was obtained and informed consent was waived. Patients suspected of acute ischemic stroke who underwent non-contrast CT(NCCT), CTA and whole-brain CTP in our center in the year 2015 were included. Three observers with different levels of experience evaluated the imaging data of 110 patients for the presence or absence of intracranial arterial vessel occlusion with two strategies. In the first strategy, only NCCT and CTA were available. In the second strategy, CTP maps were provided in addition to NCCT and CTA. Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis was used for the evaluation of diagnostic accuracy.

                             Results: Overall, a brain perfusion deficit was scored present in 87-89% of the patients with an intracranial vessel occlusion, more frequently observed in the anterior than in the posterior circulation. Performance of intracranial vessel occlusion detection on CTA was significantly improved with the availability of CTP maps as compared to the first strategy (P = 0.023), due to improved detection of distal and posterior circulation vessel occlusions (P-values of 0.032 and 0.003 respectively). No added value of CTP was found for intracranial proximal vessel occlusion detection, with already high accuracy based on NCCT and CTA alone.

                             Conclusion: The performance of intracranial vessel occlusion detection on CTA was improved with the availability of brain CT perfusion maps due to the improved detection of distal and posterior circulation vessel occlusions.},

In addition, the workshop included an invited keynote talk given by Heidi Roberts, Professor of Radiology at the University of Toronto. The proceedings of this workshop are organized into two parts. The first part consists of sixteen regular workshop papers that deal with different aspects of pulmonary image analysis, including topics like segmentation, registration, quantification, computer-aided detection/diagnosis of lung disease, and visualization. The second part of the proceedings is a collection of papers submitted for the international segmentation challenge called LOLA11 (LObe and Lung Analysis 2011, http://www.lola11.com). The goal of LOLA11 was to compare methods for (semi-) automatic segmentation of the lungs and lobes from chest computed tomography scans. Nine international teams participated in this challenge.

  abstract = {his paper presents a set of novel structural texture features for quantifying nuclear chromatin patterns in cells on a conventional Pap smear. The features are derived from an initial segmentation of the chromatin into bloblike texture primitives. The results of a comprehensive feature selection experiment, including the set of proposed structural texture features and a range of different cytology features drawn from the literature, show that two of the four top ranking features are structural texture features. They also show that a combination of structural and conventional features yields a classification performance of 0.954+-0.019 (AUC+-SE) for the discrimination of normal (NILM) and abnormal (LSIL and HSIL) slides. The results of a second classification experiment, using only normal-appearing cells from both normal and abnormal slides, demonstrates that a single structural texture feature measuring chromatin margination yields a classification performance of 0.815+-0.019. Overall the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed structural approach and that it is possible to detect malignancy associated changes (MACs) in Papanicoloau stain.},

Experimental results demonstrate that staining protocols in different laboratories and staining on different days of the week are the major factors causing color variations in histopathological images. The proposed algorithm for standardizing histology slides is based on an initial clustering of the image into two tissue components having different absorption characteristics for different dyes. The color distribution for each tissue component is standardized by aligning the 2D histogram of color distribution in the hue-saturation-density (HSD) model. Qualitative evaluation of the proposed standardization algorithm shows that color constancy of the standardized images is improved. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the algorithm outperforms competing methods. In conclusion, the paper demonstrates that staining variations, which may potentially hamper usefulness of computer assisted analysis of histopathological images, can be reduced considerably by applying the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for automatic detection of regions of interest in whole slide histopathological images. The proposed algorithm generates and classifies superpixels at multiple resolutions to detect regions of interest. The algorithm emulates the way the pathologist examines the whole slide histopathology image by processing the image at low magnifications and performing more sophisticated analysis only on areas requiring more detailed information. However, instead of the traditional usage of fixed sized rectangular patches for the identification of relevant areas, we use superpixels as the visual primitives to detect regions of interest. Rectangular patches can span multiple distinct structures, thus degrade the classification performance. The proposed multi-scale superpixel classification approach yields superior performance for the identification of the regions of interest. For the evaluation, a set of 10 whole slide histopathology images of breast tissue were used. Empirical evaluation of the performance of our proposed algorithm relative to expert manual annotations shows that the algorithm achieves an area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.958, demonstrating its efficacy for the detection of regions of interest.},

  abstract = {Diagnosis of breast carcinomas has so far been limited to the morphological interpretation of epithelial cells and the assessment of epithelial tissue architecture. Consequently, most of the automated systems have focused on characterizing the epithelial regions of the breast to detect cancer. In this paper, we propose a system for classification of hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained breast specimens based on convolutional neural networks that primarily targets the assessment of tumorassociated stroma to diagnose breast cancer patients. We evaluate the performance of our proposed system using a large cohort containing 646 breast tissue biopsies. Our evaluations show that the proposed system achieves an area under ROC of 0.92, demonstrating the discriminative power of previously neglected tumor associated stroma as a diagnostic biomarker.},

The primary aim of the research described in this thesis was to develop automated systems for analysis of H&E stained breast histopathological images. This involved automatic detection of ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS), invasive, and metastatic breast cancer in whole-slide histopathological images. A secondary aim was to identify new diagnostic biomarkers for the detection of invasive breast cancer. To this end the research was undertaken with the following objectives:

    1. Development of an algorithm for standardization of H&E stained WSIs;
    2. Detection, classification and segmentation of primary breast cancer;
    3. Evaluation of the state of the art of machine learning algorithms for automatic detection of lymph nodes metastases;

  abstract = {Currently, histopathological tissue examination by a pathologist represents the gold standard for breast lesion diagnostics. Automated classification of histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs) is challenging owing to the wide range of appearances of benign lesions and the visual similarity of ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) to invasive lesions at the cellular level. Consequently, analysis of tissue at high resolutions with a large contextual area is necessary. We present context-aware stacked convolutional neural networks (CNN) for classification of breast WSIs into normal/benign, DCIS, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). We first train a CNN using high pixel resolution to capture cellular level information. The feature responses generated by this model are then fed as input to a second CNN, stacked on top of the first. Training of this stacked architecture with large input patches enables learning of fine-grained (cellular) details and global tissue structures. Our system is trained and evaluated on a dataset containing 221 WSIs of hematoxylin and eosin stained breast tissue specimens. The system achieves an AUC of 0.962 for the binary classification of nonmalignant and malignant slides and obtains a three-class accuracy of 81.3% for classification of WSIs into normal/benign, DCIS, and IDC, demonstrating its potential for routine diagnostics.},

  abstract = {The performance of deep learning applications in digital histopathology can deteriorate significantly due to staining variations across centers. We employ cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (cycleGANs) for unpaired image-to-image translation, facilitating between-center stain transformation. We find that modifications to the original cycleGAN architecture make it more suitable for stain transformation, creating artificially stained images of high quality. Specifically, changing the generator model to a smaller U-net-like architecture, adding an identity loss term, increasing the batch size and the learning all led to improved training stability and performance. Furthermore, we propose a method for dealing with tiling artifacts when applying the network on whole slide images (WSIs). We apply our stain transformation method on two datasets of PAS-stained (Periodic Acid-Schiff) renal tissue sections from different centers. We show that stain transformation is beneficial to the performance of cross-center segmentation, raising the Dice coefficient from 0.36 to 0.85 and from 0.45 to 0.73 on the two datasets.},

  abstract = {Variation between stains in histopathology is commonplace across different medical centers. This can have a significant effect on the reliability of machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose to reduce performance variability by using -consistent generative adversarial (CycleGAN) networks to remove staining variation. We improve upon the regular CycleGAN by incorporating residual learning. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our stain transformation method and compare its usefulness in addition to extensive data augmentation to enhance the robustness of tissue segmentation algorithms. Our steps are as follows: first, we train a model to perform segmentation on tissue slides from a single source center, while heavily applying augmentations to increase robustness to unseen data. Second, we evaluate and compare the segmentation performance on data from other centers, both with and without applying our CycleGAN stain transformation. We compare segmentation performances in a colon tissue segmentation and kidney tissue segmentation task, covering data from 6 different centers. We show that our transformation method improves the overall Dice coefficient by 9% over the non-normalized target data and by 4% over traditional stain transformation in our colon tissue segmentation task. For kidney segmentation, our residual CycleGAN increases performance by 10% over no transformation and around 2% compared to the non-residual CycleGAN.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose- Since cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is associated with cognitive and motor impairment and both might ultimately lead to nursing home admission, our objective was to investigate the association of SVD markers with nursing home admission. Methods- The RUN DMC study (Radboud University Nijmegen Diffusion Tensor and Magnetic Resonance Cohort) is a prospective cohort of 503 independent living individuals with SVD. Date of nursing home admission was retrieved from the Dutch municipal personal records database. Risk of nursing home admission was calculated using a competing risk analysis, with mortality as a competing risk. Results- During follow-up (median 8.7 years, interquartile range 8.5-8.9), 31 participants moved to a nursing home. Before nursing home admission, 19 participants were diagnosed with dementia, 6 with parkinsonism, and 10 with stroke. Participants with the lowest white matter volume had an 8-year risk of nursing home admission of 13.3% (95% CI, 8.6-18.9), which was significantly different from participants with middle or highest white matter volume (respectively, 4.8% [95% CI, 2.3-8.8] and 0%; P<0.001). After adjusting for baseline age and living condition, the association of white matter volume and total brain volume with nursing home admission was significant, with, respectively, hazard ratios of 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-0.95] ( P value 0.025) and 0.92 [95% CI, 0.85-0.98] ( P<0.001) per 10 mL. The association of white matter hyperintensities and lacunes with nursing home admission was not significant. Conclusions- This study demonstrates that in SVD patients, independent from age and living condition, a lower white matter volume and a lower total brain volume is associated with an increased risk of nursing home admission. Nursing home admission is a relevant outcome in SVD research since it might be able to combine both cognitive and functional consequences of SVD in 1 outcome.},

We used an optimized sampling procedure to extract airway and non-airway voxel samples from a large set of scans for which a semi-automatically constructed reference standard was available. We created a set of features which represent tubular and texture properties that are characteristic for small airway voxels. A random forest classifier was used to determine for each voxel if it belongs to the airway class. Our method was validated on a set of 20 clinical thoracic CT scans from the COPDGene study. Experiments show that our method is effective in extracting the full airway system and in detecting a large number of small airways that were missed by the semi-automatically constructed reference standard.},

The submitted algorithms have been tested on 70 undisclosed volumes. The dataset is created in collaboration with seven hospitals and research institutions and manually reviewed by independent three radiologists. We found that not a single algorithm performed best for liver and tumors. The best liver segmentation algorithm achieved a Dice score of 0.96(MICCAI) whereas for tumor segmentation the best algorithm evaluated at 0.67(ISBI) and 0.70(MICCAI). The LITS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking resource.},

                             To create a radiomics approach based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) features extracted from an auto-fixed volume of interest (VOI) that quantifies the phenotype of clinically significant (CS) peripheral zone (PZ) prostate cancer (PCa).

                             Methods
                             This study included 206 patients with 262 prospectively called mpMRI prostate imaging reporting and data system 3-5 PZ lesions. Gleason scores > 6 were defined as CS PCa. Features were extracted with an auto-fixed 12-mm spherical VOI placed around a pin point in each lesion. The value of dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging(DCE), multivariate feature selection and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) vs. univariate feature selection and random forest (RF), expert-based feature pre-selection, and the addition of image filters was investigated using the training (171 lesions) and test (91 lesions) datasets.

                             Results
                             The best model with features from T2-weighted (T2-w) + diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) + DCE had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.870 (95% CI 0.980-0.754). Removal of DCE features decreased AUC to 0.816 (95% CI 0.920-0.710), although not significantly (p = 0.119). Multivariate and XGB outperformed univariate and RF (p = 0.028). Expert-based feature pre-selection and image filters had no significant contribution.

                             Conclusions
                             The phenotype of CS PZ PCa lesions can be quantified using a radiomics approach based on features extracted from T2-w + DWI using an auto-fixed VOI. Although DCE features improve diagnostic performance, this is not statistically significant. Multivariate feature selection and XGB should be preferred over univariate feature selection and RF. The developed model may be a valuable addition to traditional visual assessment in diagnosing CS PZ PCa.},

  abstract = {Objectives
   To investigate a previously developed radiomics-based biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI) approach for discrimination of clinically significant peripheral zone prostate cancer (PZ csPCa) using multi-center, multi-vendor (McMv) and single-center, single-vendor (ScSv) datasets.

   Methods
   This study's starting point was a previously developed ScSv algorithm for PZ csPCa whose performance was demonstrated in a single-center dataset. A McMv dataset was collected, and 262 PZ PCa lesions (9 centers, 2 vendors) were selected to identically develop a multi-center algorithm. The single-center algorithm was then applied to the multi-center dataset (single-multi-validation), and the McMv algorithm was applied to both the multi-center dataset (multi-multi-validation) and the previously used single-center dataset (multi-single-validation). The areas under the curve (AUCs) of the validations were compared using bootstrapping.

   Results
   Previously the single-single validation achieved an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI 0.71-0.92), a significant performance reduction of 27.2% compared to the single-multi-validation AUC of 0.59 (95% CI 0.51-0.68). The new multi-center model achieved a multi-multi-validation AUC of 0.75 (95% CI 0.64-0.84). Compared to the multi-single-validation AUC of 0.66 (95% CI 0.56-0.75), the performance did not decrease significantly (p value: 0.114). Bootstrapped comparison showed similar single-center performances and a significantly different multi-center performance (p values: 0.03, 0.012).

   Conclusions
   A single-center trained radiomics-based bpMRI model does not generalize to multi-center data. Multi-center trained radiomics-based bpMRI models do generalize, have equal single-center performance and perform better on multi-center data.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the referral pattern after the transition to full-field digital mammography (FFDM) in a population-based breast cancer screening programme. METHODS: Preceding the nationwide digitalisation of the Dutch screening programme, an FFDM feasibility study was conducted. Detection and referral rates for FFDM and screen-film mammography (SFM) were compared for first and subsequent screens. Furthermore, radiological characteristics of referrals in digital screening were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 312,414 screening mammograms were performed (43,913 digital and 268,501 conventional), with 4,473 consecutive referrals (966 following FFDM). Initially the FFDM referral rate peaked, and many false-positive results were noted as a consequence of pseudolesions and increased detection of (benign) microcalcifications. A higher overall referral rate was observed in FFDM screening in both first and subsequent examinations (p < .001), with a significant increase in cancer detection (p = .010). CONCLUSION: As a result of initial inexperience with digital screening images implementing FFDM in a population-based breast cancer screening programme may lead to a strong, but temporary increase in referral. Dedicated training in digital screening for radiographers and screening radiologists is therefore recommended. Referral rates decrease and stabilise (learning curve effect) at a higher level than in conventional screening, yet with significantly enhanced cancer detection.},

  abstract = {Purpose:To compare screen-film mammography with digital mammography in a breast cancer screening program, with a focus on the clinical relevance of detected cancers.Materials and Methods:The study was approved by the regional medical ethics review board. Informed consent was not required. Before the nationwide transition to digital mammography in the Dutch biennial screening program, the performance of digital mammography was studied in three screening regions. For initial screening examinations, mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal views were obtained of each breast. In subsequent examinations, the mediolateral oblique view was standard. A craniocaudal view was added if indicated. Screening outcomes obtained with screen-film mammography and digital mammography, including radiologic and pathologic characteristics, were compared for initial and subsequent examinations.Results:A total of 1 198 493 screening examinations were performed between 2003 and 2007. Recall was indicated in 18 896 cases (screen-film mammography: 2.6\% at initial examinations, 1.3\% at subsequent examinations; digital mammography: 4.4\% at initial examinations, 2.1\% at subsequent examinations; P < .001 for both). Breast cancer was diagnosed in 6410 women (detection rate per 1000 women with screen-film mammography: 5.6 at initial examinations, 5.2 at subsequent examinations; detection rate per 1000 women with digital mammography: 6.8 at initial examinations, 6.1 at subsequent examinations; P = .02 and P < .001, respectively). Digital mammography depicted significantly more ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions, irrespective of screening round. Invasive carcinoma was detected significantly more often in subsequent examinations, particularly when associated with microcalcifications (P = .047). The distribution of the histopathologic differentiation grades for DCIS and invasive carcinoma were similar with both modalities. However, with digital mammography more high-grade DCIS lesions were detected at subsequent examinations (P = .013).Conclusion:In a population-based breast screening program, the performance of digital mammography in the detection of DCIS and invasive carcinoma was substantially better than that of screen-film mammography. There is no sign of an increase in detection of low-grade DCIS lesions-indicative of possible overdiagnosis-with digital breast cancer screening. Rather, digital mammography appears to add to the detection of high-grade DCIS.A,A(c) RSNA, 2012.},

  abstract = {Objective: To estimate the potential of low-dose images in digital mammography by analysing the effect of substantial dose reduction in craniocaudal (CC) views on clinical performance. Methods: At routine mammography, additional CC views were obtained with about 10\% of the standard dose. Five radiologists retrospectively read the standard [mediolateral oblique (MLO)AC/a,!aEURdeg+AC/a,!aEURdegCC] and combination low-dose mammograms (standard MLO+low-dose CC). If present, lesion type, conspicuity, and suggested work-up were recorded. Final diagnoses were made by histology or follow-up. A t-test or Chi-square test was used to compare results. Results: 421 cases were included, presenting 5 malignancies, 66 benign lesions and multiple non-specific radiologic features. Using MLO with low-dose CC, all lesions were detected by at least one reader, but altogether less often than with standard mammography (sensitivity 73.9\% versus 81.5\%). Missed lesions concerned all types. Lesions detected with both protocols were described similarly (p=0.084) with comparable work-up recommendations (p=0.658). Conclusion: Mammography with ultra-low-dose CC images particularly influences detection. While sensitivity decreased, specificity was unaffected. In this proof-of-concept study a lower limit was to be determined that is not intended nor applicable for clinical practice. This should facilitate further research in optimisation of a low-dose approach, which has potential in a relatively young and largely asymptomatic population. Advances in Knowledge: Tungsten/silver-acquired mammography images might facilitate substantial dose reduction. Ultra-low-dose CC images reduce sensitivity, but not specificity. Low-dose images have potential in a largely young and asymptomatic population; a baseline is set for further research in optimization of a low-dose approach.},

  title = {Automated structure segmentation and lymphocyte detection in kidney transplant whole slide images using a convolutional neural network},
  abstract = {Much research is done to understand and prevent renal allograft rejection. Where acute rejection is brought back to a minimum, late rejection still occurs too frequent. Renal allografts with declined function are classified into rejection types by pathologists to improve treatment. This classification is based upon various grading criteria in stained pathological slides. Criteria depend on the different structures present in the kidney and quantification of inflammation. Since the digitization of pathological slides into whole slide images (WSIs), computer aided analyses have proven useful. Artificial neural networks have shown consistent in automated image analyses with quality comparable to trained experts. Here, we examine a convolutional neural networks as a means to aid analysis of renal allograft WSIs on two subjects: segmentation of kidney structures and segmentation of lymphocytes. A dataset of renal allograft biopsies from the Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands was used. Overall structure segmentation performance is good with a dice coefficient of 0.88. Segmentation of certain specific structures could be increased, but overall the segmentation maps are presumably valuable. Performance of lymphocyte segmentation proves more difficult with a dice coefficient of 0.60 and a large amount of false positives in lymphocyte instance detection. Segmentation performance of the model is currently not sufficient for the difficult task, but indicates future possibilities for lymphocyte segmentation using convolutional neural networks.},

  abstract = {The increasing incidence of pancreatic cancer will make it the second deadliest cancer in 2030. Artificial intelligence can help provide and improve widespread diagnostic expertise and accurate interventional image interpretation. Accurate segmentation of the pancreas is essential to create annotated data sets to train AI, and for computer assisted interventional guidance. Automated deep learning segmentation performance in pancreas CT imaging is low due to poor grey value contrast and complex anatomy. A good solution seemed a recent interactive deep learning segmentation framework for brain CT that helped strongly improve initial automated segmentation with minimal user input. This method yielded no satisfactory results for pancreas CT, possibly due to a sub-optimal neural architecture. We hypothesize that a state-of-the-art U-net neural architecture is better because it can produce a better initial segmentation and is likely to be extended to work in an interactive approach. We implemented the existing interactive method, iFCN, and developed an interactive version of U-net method we call iUnet. The iUnet is fully trained to produce the best possible initial segmentation. In interactive mode it is additionally trained on a partial set of layers on user generated scribbles. We compare initial segmentation performance of iFCN and iUnet on a 100CT dataset using DSC analysis. Secondly, we assessed the performance gain in interactive use with three observers on segmentation quality and time. Average automated baseline performance was 78\% (iUnet) vs 72\% (FCN). Manual and semi-automatic segmentation performance was: 87\% in 15 min. for manual, and 86\% in 8 min. for iUNet. We conclude that iUnet provides a better baseline than iFCN and can reach expert manual performance significantly faster than manual segmentation in case of pancreas CT. Our novel iUnet architecture is modality and organ agnostic and can be a potential novel solution for semi-automatic medical imaging segmentation in general.},

                            A current challenge in real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided minimally invasive images is needle tracking and planning. We propose a pipeline for automatic object detection using a state-of-the-art object detection network. Predictions by the object detection network were used to translate the MRI plane to keep a guidewire tip in a plane. We evaluated the pipeline on displacement error between the prediction and the actual location of the guidewire tip in a setup with an anthropomorphic blood vessel. For this setup, we hypothesized that the network should be able to correctly predict the actual location within a margin of 10 mm, at least within 1000 ms.
                            Results show that the pipeline can accurately track the guidewire tip in real-time (within 458 ms), with a mean displacement error of 7 mm (s = 4). Based on this evidence, we have demonstrated the feasibility of deep learning assisted image-guided interventions, creating possibilities for other deep learning guided interventions. Our proposed method shows potential for cryoablation. During these types of minimally invasive procedures tracking needles can be a challenge.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of the oncogenesis of high-grade serous cancer of the ovary and its precursor lesions, such as serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), has significantly increased over the last decades. Adequate and reproducible diagnosis of these precursor lesions is important. Diagnosing STIC can have prognostic consequences and is an absolute requirement for safely offering alternative risk reducing strategies, such as risk reducing salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy. However, diagnosing STIC is a challenging task, possessing only moderate reproducibility. In this review and meta-analysis, we look at how pathologists come to a diagnosis of STIC. We performed a literature search identifying 39 studies on risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in women with a known BRCA1/2 PV, collectively reporting on 6833 patients. We found a pooled estimated proportion of STIC of 2.8% (95% CI, 2.0-3.7). We focused on reported grossing protocols, morphological criteria, level of pathologist training, and the use of immunohistochemistry. The most commonly mentioned morphological characteristics of STIC are (1) loss of cell polarity, (2) nuclear pleomorphism, (3) high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, (4) mitotic activity, (5) pseudostratification, and (6) prominent nucleoli. The difference in reported incidence of STIC between studies who totally embedded all specimens and those who did not was 3.2% (95% CI, 2.3-4.2) versus 1.7% (95% CI, 0.0-6.2) (p 0.24). We provide an overview of diagnostic features and present a framework for arriving at an adequate diagnosis, consisting of the use of the SEE-FIM grossing protocol, evaluation by a subspecialized gynecopathologist, rational use of immunohistochemical staining, and obtaining a second opinion from a colleague.},

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the current standard of care in assessing the presence and quantity of retinal fluid and image-guided treatment management. Deep learning methods have made their impact across medical imaging, and many retinal OCT analysis methods have been proposed. However, it is currently not clear how successful they are in interpreting the retinal fluid on OCT, which is due to the lack of standardized benchmarks. To address this, we organized a challenge RETOUCH in conjunction with MICCAI 2017, with eight teams participating. The challenge consisted of two tasks: fluid detection and fluid segmentation. It featured for the first time: all three retinal fluid types, with annotated images provided by two clinical centers, which were acquired with the three most common OCT device vendors from patients with two different retinal diseases. The analysis revealed that in the detection task, the performance on the automated fluid detection was within the inter-grader variability. However, in the segmentation task, fusing the automated methods produced segmentations that were superior to all individual methods, indicating the need for further improvements in the segmentation performance.},

We explored the application of deep learning techniques to detect TB in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained slides, and used convolutional neural networks to classify image patches as containing tumor buds, tumor glands and background. As a reference standard for training we stained slides both with H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC), where one pathologist first annotated buds in IHC and then transferred the obtained annotations to the corresponding H&E image. We show the effectiveness of the proposed three-class approach, which allows to substantially reduce the amount of false positives, especially when combined with a hard-negative mining technique. Finally we report the results of an observer study aimed at investigating the correlation between pathologists at detecting TB in IHC and H&E.},

  abstract = {Tumor budding (TB) is a promising and cost-effective biomarker with strong prognostic value in colorectal cancer. We previously found moderate agreement between two pathologists scoring TB using the International Tumor Budding Consensus Conference (ITBCC) guidelines, while considerable discrepancy in identifying individual tumor buds was observed. To explore this issue further, we performed a large-scale international digital observer study on the assessment of individual tumor buds. We extracted 3000 tumor bud candidates by application of digital image analysis algorithms. For every candidate, an image patch (size 256x256um) was extracted from pan-cytokeratinstained whole-slide images of 36 patients with reported TB. Members of a tumor budding consortium were invited to categorize each individual object as (1) tumor bud, (2) poorly differentiated cluster, or (3) none of the previous, based on best practice and current definitions. Agreement was assessed with Cohen's and Fleiss Kappa. Cohen's and Fleiss Kappa showed a fair to moderate overall agreement between observers (range 0.24-0.65 and 0.37 respectively) when asked to score 3000 individual objects. Despite adequate agreement between observers in the assessment of TB on patient level, the agreement on individual tumor bud level using immunohistochemistry is only fair. To better understand the causes of this disagreement, more research is needed involving H&E stained images.

  abstract = {Tumor budding is a promising and cost-effective biomarker with strong prognostic value in colorectal cancer. However, challenges related to interobserver variability persist. Such variability may be reduced by immunohistochemistry and computer-aided tumor bud selection. Development of computer algorithms for this purpose requires unequivocal examples of individual tumor buds. As such, we undertook a large-scale, international, and digital observer study on individual tumor bud assessment. From a pool of 46 colorectal cancer cases with tumor budding, 3000 tumor bud candidates were selected, largely based on digital image analysis algorithms. For each candidate bud, an image patch (size 256 x 256 um) was extracted from a pan cytokeratin-stained whole-slide image. Members of an International Tumor Budding Consortium (n = 7) were asked to categorize each candidate as either (1) tumor bud, (2) poorly differentiated cluster, or (3) neither, based on current definitions. Agreement was assessed with Cohen's and Fleiss Kappa statistics. Fleiss Kappa showed moderate overall agreement between observers (0.42 and 0.51), while Cohen's Kappas ranged from 0.25 to 0.63. Complete agreement by all seven observers was present for only 34% of the 3000 tumor bud candidates, while 59% of the candidates were agreed on by at least five of the seven observers. Despite reports of moderate-to-substantial agreement with respect to tumor budding grade, agreement with respect to individual pan cytokeratin-stained tumor buds is moderate at most. A machine learning approach may prove especially useful for a more robust assessment of individual tumor buds.},

  title = {Computer-assisted hot-spot selection for tumor budding assessment in colorectal cancer},
  abstract = {Background & objectives
                            Tumor budding (TB) is an established prognosticator for colorectal cancer. Detection of the hot-spot to score TB is based on visual inspection, hindering reproducibility of this important factor. We present an algorithm that can potentially assist pathologists in this task.

                            Methods
                            We used a previously developed algorithm for the detection of tumor buds in pan-cytokeratin stained whole slide images, calculating the number of buds for each location using a circle with 0.785mm2 surface area. From these numbers, density heatmaps were produced. The algorithm was applied to 270 slides from Bern University hospital, in which hot-spots and tumor buds were visually identified.

                            Results
                            Heat maps were created and we located the hand-selected hotspot and noted the associated TB number. The differences and similarities between computer identified and manually selected hot-spots were visually assessed as well as via histograms. Preliminary results show that the heatmaps are helpful, as locations with the highest TB density (the top 15%) also include the hand-selected hotspots. The full results will be presented during the conference.

                            Conclusion
                            The presented algorithm can assist the pathologist in selecting the hot-spot with the highest tumor bud count with more ease at low magnification and can help to reduce the high interobserver variability among pathologists in scoring tumor budding.},

  abstract = {Background & objectives
                            Tumor budding (TB) is an established prognosticator for colorectal cancer. Deep learning based TB assessment has the potential to improve diagnostic reproducibility and efficiency.  We developed an algorithm that can detect individual tumor buds in pan-cytokeratin stained colorectal cancer slides

                            Methods
                            Tumor-bud candidates (n=1765, collected from 58 whole slide images; WSI) were labeled by seven experts as either TB, poorly differentiated cluster, or neither. The 58 slides were randomly split into a training (49) and test-set (9). A deep learning (DL) model was trained using the buds identified by the experts in the training set.

                            Results
                            The algorithm was tested on the nine remaining WSI and 270 WSI from pan-cytokeratin stained slides from Bern University hospital, in which hot spots and TB were manually scored. An F1 score of 0.82 was found for correspondence at the bud level between experts and DL. A correlation of 0.745 was found between the manually counted buds within the hotspots and the automated method in the 270 WSIs.

                            Conclusion
                            Assessment of tumor budding as a prognostic factor for colorectal cancer can be automated using deep learning. At the level of individual tumor buds, correspondence between DL and  experts is high and comparable to the inter-rater variability. However, compared to the manual procedure, the algorithm yields higher counts for cases with relatively high bud densities (>15). Follow-up studies will focus on the assessment of TB in H&E stained slides.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of computer-aided detection (CAD, IQQA-Chest; EDDA Technology, Princeton Junction, NJ) used as second reader on the detection of small pulmonary nodules in chest radiography (CXR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 113 patients (mean age 62 years) with CT and CXR within 6 weeks were selected. Fifty-nine patients showed 101 pulmonary nodules (diameter 5-15mm); the remaining 54 patients served as negative controls. Six readers of varying experience individually evaluated the CXR without and with CAD as second reader in two separate reading sessions. The sensitivity per lesion, figure of merit (FOM), and mean false positive per image (mFP) were calculated. Institutional review board approval was waived. RESULTS: With CAD, the sensitivity increased for inexperienced readers (39\% vs. 45\%, P < .05) and remained unchanged for experienced readers (50\% vs. 51\%). The mFP nonsignificantly increased for both inexperienced and experienced readers (0.27 vs. 0.34 and 0.16 vs. 0.21). The mean FOM did not significantly differ for readings without and with CAD irrespective of reader experience (0.71 vs. 0.71 and 0.84 vs. 0.87). All readers together dismissed 33\% of true-positive CAD candidates. False-positive candidates by CAD provoked 40\% of all false-positive marks made by the readers. CONCLUSION: CAD improves the sensitivity of inexperienced readers for the detection of small nodules at the expense of loss of specificity. Overall performance by means of FOM was therefore not affected. To use CAD more beneficial, readers need to improve their ability to differentiate true from false-positive CAD candidates.},

Seventy-three percent of patients showed variable degrees of radiographic findings of a "dirty lung."

Figure of merit (FOM), sensitivity per lesion, mean number of false-positive marks per image, and accuracy were calculated.Five of the six readers showed a slight increase in sensitivity with the use of gray-scale reversal, but on average, the difference was not significant (48\% vs 50\%; p > 0.05). The mean number of false-positive marks per image also nonsignificantly increased from 0.20 to 0.23. The increases in both sensitivity and the mean number of false-positive marks per image translated into nonsignificant decreases in average FOM (0.79 vs 0.77) and accuracy (72\% vs 71\%). Data analysis of subgroups of nodules or different reader groups, depending on level of experience, did not reveal significant differences.Using PACS display of digital chest radiographs, gray-scale reversal does not help the radiologists in detecting pulmonary nodules.},

Delineation of anatomic structures and devices used for patient monitoring, overall image quality and disease were scored by four readers. In 12 patients pairs of follow-up CR and DR images were available, and in 15 patients pairs of CR and DR(50\%) images were available. In these pairs the overall image quality was also compared side-by-side.Delineation of anatomy in the mediastinum was scored better with DR or DR(50\%) than with CR. Devices used for patient monitoring were seen best with DR, with DR(50\%) being superior to CR. In the side-by-side comparison, the overall image quality of DR and DR(50\%) was rated better than CR in 96\% (46/48) and 87\% (52/60), respectively. Inter-observer agreement for the assessment of pathology was fair for CR and DR(50\%) (? = 0.33 and ? = 0.39, respectively) and moderate for DR (? = 0.48).Mobile DR units offer better image quality than CR for bedside chest radiography and allow for 50\% dose reduction. Inter-observer agreement increases with image quality and is superior with DR, while DR(50\%) and CR are comparable.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To use a hybrid digital phantom to study the effect of mAs on quantitative evaluation of cerebral CT perfusion scans. Material and Methods: The hybrid digital phantom consists of scans of a homogeneous skull phantom on which circular objects (10-15-20mm) are digitally superimposed. Tissue perfusion curves derived from patient data were superimposed on the background (white matter) and on the objects (grey matter). We tested a CTP sequence using 30 scans every 2s over 60s (80kV, 5mm thickness) derived from a 320-row CT scanner. The mAs values per CTP sequence were varied per scan (10-230mAs). A synthetic dataset without noise was the gold standard. CBF maps for each mAs setting and for the synthetic dataset were calculated using the ASIST CT program. Noise in CBF maps was measured in the background; contrast between background and objects was measured in circular ROIs with a diameter of half the object diameter. Size- and dose-dependence of absolute values and CNR in CBF maps was calculated. Results: Above 55 mAs per scan, the CBV values for the 20mm objects were within 12% of the gold standard. At 10 mAs CBF was overestimated by >100%. With smaller objects the estimation of CBF became less precise. CNR for CBF in 20mm decreased rapidly: CNR at 230 mAs was 4.2 and decreased to 2.4 at 100 mAs and 0.4 at 10 mAs. Conclusion: Absolute CBF values require sufficient dose to be correct: values at low dose are overestimated. In addition, CNR rapidly decreases with lower dose.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To quantitatively evaluate the effect of dose reduction of a standard head CTP protocol on the perfusion maps. Material and Methods: A hybrid digital perfusion phantom was used to simulate dose reduction in a CT perfusion acquisition. Noise patterns were obtained by scanning an epoxy filled human skull phantom on multiple mAs levels on a 320-row scanner and combined with tissue attenuation curves obtained from 5 patient data for grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), artery and vein. We simulated a real clinical CTP head protocol available on the Toshiba CT console (1 scan at 200 mAs, 13 scans at 100 mAs, 5 scans at 75 mAs and all at 80 kV) with a total duration of 55s (5mm slab thickness) and artificially reduced the dose from 100% to 10% in steps of 10%. CBF, CBV and MTT maps were calculated using PMA (ASIST-JAPAN). Mean values of GM and WM were evaluated. Results: Absolute CBF and CBV values stay within 20% of the values at original dose for CTP acquisitions at more than 50% of the original dose for both GM and WM. At 10% of the original dose, WM CBV values were overestimated with 24-107%, GM CBV values with 4-32%, and WM CBF values with 42-106%. GM CBF values were within 20% of the values at 100% of original dose. MTT values were less affected by dose reduction.

  abstract = {Purpose Optimizing CT brain perfusion protocols is a challenge because of the complex interaction between image acquisition, calculation of perfusion data and patient hemodynamics. Several digital phantoms have been developed to avoid unnecessary patient exposure or suboptimum choice of parameters. We expand this idea by using realistic noise patterns and measured tissue attenuation curves representing patient-specific hemodynamics. The purpose of this work is to validate that this approach can realistically simulate mean perfusion values and noise on perfusion data for individual patients. Materials and Methods The proposed 4D digital phantom consists of three major components: 1) a definition of the spatial structure of various brain tissues within the phantom, 2) measured tissue attenuation curves and 3) measured noise patterns. Tissue attenuation curves were measured in patient data using regions of interest (ROIs) in gray matter and white matter. By assigning the tissue attenuation curves to the corresponding tissue curves within the phantom, patient-specific CTP acquisitions were retrospectively simulated. Noise patterns were acquired by repeatedly scanning an anthropomorphic skull phantom at various exposure settings. We selected 20 consecutive patients that were scanned for suspected ischemic stroke and constructed patient-specific 4D digital phantoms using the individual patients' hemodynamics. We compared the perfusion maps of the patient data with the digital phantom data. Agreement between phantom- and patient-derived data was determined for mean perfusion values and for standard deviation in de perfusion data using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and a linear fit. Results ICCs ranged between 0.92-0.99 for mean perfusion values. ICCs for the standard deviation in perfusion maps were between 0.86-0.93. Linear fitting yielded slope values between 0.90-1.06. Conclusions A patient-specific 4D digital phantom allows for realistic simulation of mean values and standard deviation in perfusion data and makes it possible to retrospectively study how the interaction of patient hemodynamics and scan parameters affects CT perfusion values.},

  abstract = {Adversarial attacks are considered a potentially serious security threat for machine learning systems. Medical image analysis (MedIA) systems have recently been argued to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to strong financial incentives and the associated technological infrastructure. In this paper, we study previously unexplored factors affecting adversarial attack vulnerability of deep learning MedIA systems in three medical domains: ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology. We focus on adversarial black-box settings, in which the attacker does not have full access to the target model and usually uses another model, commonly referred to as surrogate model, to craft adversarial examples that are then transferred to the target model. We consider this to be the most realistic scenario for MedIA systems. Firstly, we study the effect of weight initialization (pre-training on ImageNet or random initialization) on the transferability of adversarial attacks from the surrogate model to the target model, i.e., how effective attacks crafted using the surrogate model are on the target model. Secondly, we study the influence of differences in development (training and validation) data between target and surrogate models. We further study the interaction of weight initialization and data differences with differences in model architecture. All experiments were done with a perturbation degree tuned to ensure maximal transferability at minimal visual perceptibility of the attacks. Our experiments show that pre-training may dramatically increase the transferability of adversarial examples, even when the target and surrogate's architectures are different: the larger the performance gain using pre-training, the larger the transferability. Differences in the development data between target and surrogate models considerably decrease the performance of the attack; this decrease is further amplified by difference in the model architecture. We believe these factors should be considered when developing security-critical MedIA systems planned to be deployed in clinical practice. We recommend avoiding using only standard components, such as pre-trained architectures and publicly available datasets, as well as disclosure of design specifications, in addition to using adversarial defense methods. When evaluating the vulnerability of MedIA systems to adversarial attacks, various attack scenarios and target-surrogate differences should be simulated to achieve realistic robustness estimates. The code and all trained models used in our experiments are publicly available.

  title = {Augmenting AI with Automated Segmentation of Report Findings Applied to Prostate Cancer Detection in Biparametric MRI},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To improve risk stratification of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) with a 3D deep learning detection model, by augmenting the largest prostate MRI dataset reported in literature to date. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 6,866 prostate bpMRI studies (axial T2- weighted, high b-value (>= 1400) and apparent diffusion coefficient scans) from 5,646 consecutive patients, with elevated PSA or clinical suspicion of PCa, between 2014-2020 for training. All studies were evaluated by experienced radiologists during clinical routine. The findings in 2,659 studies were manually segmented. We propose a hybrid framework to augment our detection model with more training data. After training with expert csPCa segmentations, we generate automatic cancer segmentations by masking our model predictions with the number of csPCa lesions automatically extracted from radiology reports. An augmented detection model is then trained jointly on manual and automatically generated csPCa segmentations. Models trained on expert or augmented cancer segmentations are evaluated on 296 visits of 296 consecutive men with elevated PSA or clinical suspicion of prostate cancer from an independent, external, centre. Ground truth is provided by MR-guided and TRUS-guided biopsies, and radical prostatectomy when available. Studies are considered positive if they have at least one Gleason grade group >= 2 lesion (csPCa). We trained our models on expert and augmented segmentations with 5-fold cross-validation and 5 restarts. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC). We performed a permutation test to obtain the statistical significance level. RESULTS: Augmenting the training set with automatic csPCa segmentations guided by report findings, sig- nificantly improves the case-level risk stratification of csPCa. For the external test set, the AUROC increased from 85.7 +- 2.5% to 89.0 +- 1.2% (P < 0.0001). On the external test set, experienced radiologists had a sensitivity of 91.4+-2.7% at 78.3+-2.4% specificity. At the same sensitivity, adding automatic segmentations improved the model's specificity from 46.8 +- 12.8% to 62.0 +- 7.1% (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Augmenting training with automatic report driven segmentations of prostate cancer in bpMRI significantly improved the risk-stratification of the deep learning prostate cancer detection model. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Risk stratification for clinically significant prostate cancer using prostate MRI is in- strumental to reduce over-treatment. Deep learning can assist, but requires expensive expert segmentations.},

  abstract = {Prostate MRI interpreted by expert radiologists provides the best non-invasive diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), but is a limited resource. Deep learning has the potential to assist, but requires expensive expert annotations. We developed an automatic labelling procedure guided by radiology reports from clinical routine, capable of generating high quality voxel-level annotations. First, we parse the radiology report to extract the number of clinically significant findings (nsig), and then generate annotation by keeping the nsig most confident lesion candidates from a csPCa segmentation model. We included 7,756 prostate bpMRI studies (axial T2, high b-value and ADC scans), of which 3,052 were manually annotated and 4,704 were automatically annotated, resulting in the largest prostate MRI dataset reported in literature. We evaluated the automatic annotation procedure using the manual annotations: our score extraction correctly identified nsig for 99.3% of the visits, our prostate cancer segmentation model correctly localised 83.7 +- 3.0% of the lesions, and the automatic annotations of correctly localised lesions have good spatial congruence, with Dice similarity coefficients of 0.71+-0.15. Augmenting the training set with automatically labelled visits significantly improved prostate cancer detection performance, as evaluated on 296 visits from an independent, external, centre with ground truth provided by MR-guided and TRUS-guided biopsies, or radical prostatectomy when available. Patient-based diagnostic AUROC increased from 86.6 +- 1.8% to 88.7 +- 1.1% (P = 0.047) and lesion-based diagnostic pAUC increased from 1.940+-0.082 to 2.050+-0.031 (P = 0.016), with mean+-std. over 25 independent runs.},

  title = {Automated Detection and Assessment of Vertebral Fractures in CT Images},
  abstract = {Osteoporotic vertebral fractures are associated with an increased mortality, morbidity, a decrease in quality of life and are strong predictors of future osteoporotic fractures. Many guidelines on management of osteoporosis recommend pharmacological intervention when vertebral fractures are present. However, they remain largely underdiagnosed, due to frequently occurring asymptomatic and often not being reported by clinicians when present in computed tomography (CT) scans. The aim of this study is to explore the use of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to assist clinicians with detection and assessment of vertebral fractures based on CT images, thereby enabling preventive treatment and improving the outcome for osteoporosis patients. In the first part of this work we developed an automated method that performs Genant's semiquantitative method, one of the most widely used methods for assessment of vertebral fractures today. Results on a test set of 12 patients (116 vertebrae) show that the method is able to grade vertebral fractures with substantial agreement with two radiologists, with a quadratic weighted kappa value of 0.92. In the second part of this work we address the most notable limitations of Genant's semiquantitative method. We developed an automated scoring method that aims to bring both convenience and consistency to the field. The scoring method compares the shape of the vertebral body with the expected shape to calculate an abnormality score, which quantifies collapse of the vertebra and can be used to identify fractures. We again evaluated the scoring method on a test set of 12 patients (116 vertebrae) and show that the abnormality score corresponds well with assessment of two radiologists, with a quadratic weighted kappa value of 0.85 while addressing the main limitations of Genant's semiquantitative method.},

  abstract = {Emphysema has considerable variability in its regional distribution. Craniocaudal emphysema distribution is an important predictor of the response to lung volume reduction. However, there is little consensus regarding how to define upper lobe-predominant and lower lobe-predominant emphysema subtypes. Consequently, the clinical and genetic associations with these subtypes are poorly characterized. We sought to identify subgroups characterized by upper-lobe or lower-lobe emphysema predominance and comparable amounts of total emphysema by analyzing data from 9,210 smokers without alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency in the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) cohort. CT densitometric emphysema was measured in each lung lobe. Random forest clustering was applied to lobar emphysema variables after regressing out the effects of total emphysema. Clusters were tested for association with clinical and imaging outcomes at baseline and at 5-year follow-up. Their associations with genetic variants were also compared. Three clusters were identified: minimal emphysema (n = 1,312), upper lobe-predominant emphysema (n = 905), and lower lobe-predominant emphysema (n = 796). Despite a similar amount of total emphysema, the lower-lobe group had more severe airflow obstruction at baseline and higher rates of metabolic syndrome compared with subjects with upper-lobe predominance. The group with upper-lobe predominance had greater 5-year progression of emphysema, gas trapping, and dyspnea. Differential associations with known COPD genetic risk variants were noted. Subgroups of smokers defined by upper-lobe or lower-lobe emphysema predominance exhibit different functional and radiological disease progression rates, and the upper-lobe predominant subtype shows evidence of association with known COPD genetic risk variants. These subgroups may be useful in the development of personalized treatments for COPD.},

  title = {Automatically Generated CT Severity Scores for COVID-19 Predict Death or Intubation at 1-Month Follow-Up},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of CORADS-AI, an automatic system that was originally developed for scoring the presence and current extent of a COVID19 infection from chest Computed Tomography (CT), to predict death or intubation after one month for positive COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: CORADS-AI was developed in a previous study using CT scans from COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands. From a CT scan, CORADS-AI automatically segments each pulmonary lobe and produces a CT Severity Score (CTSS) at the lobe and patient level. This score is based on the percentage of affected tissue and has been used in routine clinical practice. We applied CORADS-AI to all 1205 patients that were involved in the STOIC study, had a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR result, and for which a CT scan was publicly available. 301 of them had died or had to be intubated at 1-month follow-up. We applied logistic regression with 5-fold cross validation on patient sex, age, and the patient level CTSS output of CORADS-AI to predict death or intubation after one month. We compared our method with the logistic regression model from the original STOIC study. This model received age, sex, several clinical variables, and manual CT annotations for lung disease extent as input. It was developed with all 4238 patients from the STOIC study that were positive for COVID-19 both according to RT-PCR testing and CT reading. RESULTS: Our model obtained an AUC of 0.72+-0.02 (mean+-std. dev.) for predicting death or intubation after one month. When using solely the patient level CTSS output, we obtained an AUC of 0.68+-0.03. In comparison, the original STOIC study reported an AUC of their model of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.71). CONCLUSIONS: We showed that CORADS-AI can predict death or intubation after one month for positive COVID-19 patients. Adding age and sex information to the model improved its results. The performance was comparable to that of the model developed in the original STOIC study, which used additional clinical variables and manual CT annotations. This comparison should be interpreted carefully, since that model was evaluated on a different subset of the STOIC cohort. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: We showed the potential of CORADS-AI, of which the output format is already used in clinical practice, for aiding radiologists in predicting the course of a COVID-19 infection.},

  abstract = {The size of a lesion is a feature often used in computer-aided detection systems for classification between benign and malignant lesions. However, size of a lesion presented by its area might not be as reliable as volume of a lesion. Volume is more independent of the view (CC or MLO) since it represents three dimensional information, whereas area refers only to the projection of a lesion on a two dimensional plane. Furthermore, volume might be better than area for comparing lesion size in two consecutive exams and for evaluating temporal change to distinguish benign and malignant lesions. We have used volumetric breast density estimation in digital mammograms to obtain thickness of dense tissue in regions of interest in order to compute volume of lesions. The dataset consisted of 382 mammogram pairs in CC and MLO views and 120 mammogram pairs for temporal analysis. The obtained correlation coefficients between the lesion size in the CC and MLO views were 0.70 (0.64-0.76) and 0.83 (0.79-0.86) for area and volume, respectively. Two- tailed z-test showed a significant difference between two correlation coefficients (p=0.0001). The usage of area and volume in temporal analysis of mammograms has been evaluated using ROC analysis. The obtained values of the area under the curve (AUC) were 0.73 and 0.75 for area and volume, respectively. Although a higher AUC value for volume was found, this difference was not significant (p=0.16).},

  abstract = {Temporal comparison of lesions might improve classification between benign and malignant lesions in full-field digital mammograms (FFDM). The authors compare the use of volumetric features for lesion classification, which are computed from dense tissue thickness maps, to the use of mammographic lesion area. Use of dense tissue thickness maps for lesion characterization is advantageous, since it results in lesion features that are invariant to acquisition parameters.The dataset used in the analysis consisted of 60 temporal mammogram pairs comprising 120 mediolateral oblique or craniocaudal views with a total of 65 lesions, of which 41 were benign and 24 malignant. The authors analyzed the performance of four volumetric features, area, and four other commonly used features obtained from temporal mammogram pairs, current mammograms, and prior mammograms. The authors evaluated the individual performance of all features and of different feature sets. The authors used linear discriminant analysis with leave-one-out cross validation to classify different feature sets.Volumetric features from temporal mammogram pairs achieved the best individual performance, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az value). Volume change (Az = 0.88) achieved higher Az value than projected lesion area change (Az = 0.78) in the temporal comparison of lesions. Best performance was achieved with a set that consisted of a set of features extracted from the current exam combined with four volumetric features representing changes with respect to the prior mammogram (Az = 0.90). This was significantly better (p = 0.005) than the performance obtained using features from the current exam only (Az = 0.77).Volumetric features from temporal mammogram pairs combined with features from the single exam significantly improve discrimination of benign and malignant lesions in FFDM mammograms compared to using only single exam features. In the comparison with prior mammograms, use of volumetric change may lead to better performance than use of lesion area change.},

Our aim was to investigate if forced fluid infusion may be replaced by a new pharmacological therapy to stabilize circulation after brain death in an animal model, and to assess therapy effects on lung function and morphology trough blood gas parameters and state-of-the-art High-resolution CT (HRCT).Brain death was caused by surgical decapitation. To maintain mean aortic pressure > 60 mmHg, pigs were treated with forced electrolyte solution infusion (GI; n = 6) or the pharmacological therapy (GII; n = 11). GIII (n = 11) were non-decapitated controls. Lung function was investigated with blood gases and lung morphology with HRCT.GI pigs became circulatory instable 4-6 h after brain death in spite of forced fluid infusion, five pigs showed moderate to severe pulmonary edema on HRCT and median final PaO2 /FiO2 was 29 kPa (Q1; Q3; range 26; 40; 17-76). GII and GIII were circulatory stable (mean aortic pressure > 80 mmHg) and median final PaO2 /FiO2 after 24 h was 72 kPa (Q1; Q3; range 64; 76; 53-91) (GII) and 66 kPa (55; 78; 43-90) (GIII). On HRCT, only two pigs in GII had mild pulmonary edema and none in GIII. More than 50\% of HRCT exams revealed unexpected lung disease even in spite of PaO2 /FiO2 > 40 kPa.Pharmacological therapy but not forced fluid infusion prevented circulatory collapse and extensive HRCT verified pulmonary edema after acute brain death. HRCT was useful to evaluate lung morphology and revealed substantial occult parenchymal changes justifying efforts toward a more intense use of HRCT in the pre-transplant evaluation.},

  url = {http://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/18825},
  abstract = {This thesis describes the components of an automated detection method for masses and architectural distortions, signs of infiltrating cancer. Masses and architectural distortions can be very subtle and are frequently missed by radiologists. Because the success of treatment of breast cancer depends largely on the stage of the tumor at the time of detection, early detection is very important. Masses have two main image characteristics that can be used for detection: a radiating pattern of spicules and a mass. Sometimes both characteristics are present, but often only spicules or just a faint mass is visible. To achieve high sensitivity on the whole spectrum of possible appearances of masses and distortions, detection of both characteristics is essential. Chapter 2 describes a sensitive method to detect radiating spicule patterns using statistical analysis of line orientations. However, many masses do not show clear spiculation, and must be detected by their mass. Chapter 3 describes how the spicule detection method can be transformed to a mass detection method. Instead of a map of line orientations, a map of gradient orientations is computed. Statistical analysis of this orientation map was used to detect masses. A large set of mammograms taken from the Nijmegen screening program was used to test a detection method based on spicules, a detection method based on masses, and a detection method that detects both spicules and masses. Best results were obtained when both the spiculation and mass features were used. Of all masses, 85% was detected at a specificity level of 1 false positive per image, 55% at 1 false positive per 10 images. The diameter of masses in mammograms varies from 5 mm to 5 cm, inspiring many research groups to use multi-scale approaches to detect masses. However, the benefit of applying their method in a multi-scale way is almost never compared to a single-scale version of their method. In Chapter 4, the mass detection method of Chapter 3 and two popular pattern recognition techniques to detect bright areas were applied in a single and multi-scale way to examine the possible gain of multi-scale detection. It appeared that the multi-scale versions of the mass detection method had similar performance as a single-scale approach if this scale was chosen appropriately. Of course, when the scale for the single-scale approach was chosen sub-optimally the performance was lower. This study shows that it is not self-evident that a multi-scale mass detection method gives better results than a single-scale version of the method. A multi-scale method is sensitive for masses over a range of sizes, but is also sensitive for false positives of different sizes. The specificity level that was achieved by the mass detection method described in Chapter 3 is not high enough for successful application in the clinic or in screening. To improve the specificity, a second stage was designed, that classifies each detected region based on regional criteria like contrast, shape, and texture. Based on such features, many normal tissue regions could be discriminated from real masses. To compute these features, a segmentation of the suspicious regions is required. In Chapter 5, a method is described to segment masses 126 using a discrete dynamic contour model. For each region a size estimate was available of the suspect region, and an appropriate initial starting contour was created that was fitted to the edge of the region. The method proved to be fast and robust, and outperformed a region growing approach. In Chapter 6, the contour model was used to segment regions that were found by the mass detection method of Chapter 3. A number of features were implemented that capture image characteristics that radiologists use to determine whether a suspicious region is a mass or dense normal tissue. Classification using these regional features gave a large reduction in false positives at each desired sensitivity level. On two large datasets a relatively high sensitivity was achieved even at high specificity levels. In Chapter 7,
                              all segmentation methods of Chapter 5 were used to segment and classify the detected regions. The adaptive discrete contour method that was used in Chapter 6 and the preprocessed probabilistic region growing method gave similar results. The experiments of Chapter 8 showed that a substantial number of the tumors that were missed by radiologists in a screening program despite double reading, were detected by the mass detection method of Chapter 3. Successful detection of missed tumors indicates that a CAD system can be a useful tool for radiologists if the prompts are sufficiently specific. Chapter 9 describes two experiments that were done using a commercially available prompting device. A large experiment showed that the specificity of radiologists does not decrease when they are prompted. This is an important result because some fear that the large number of false positive prompts of a CAD system might increases the recall rate. Results of a second experiment indicated that radiologists have much more difficulty with interpreting suspicious signs than is generally believed. It seems that many screening errors that are thought to be due to oversight, are due to misinterpretation. Both experiments showed large differences in the performance levels of radiologists. Detection of masses is reaching a level of performance where successful use in screening or clinical practice is possible. Approximately 75% of all masses are detected in at least one view at a specificity level of 0.1 false positives per image. Improvement of the mass and spicule features is still possible, and more sophisticated features can be used to remove false positives. Because the data sets that are used for training are becoming larger, better classifiers can be produced. A considerable improvement can be expected when suspicious regions in one view are correlated to suspicious regions in the other view. Many strong false positives are only present in one of the views, real lesions are most often visible in both. Together with asymmetry features and a method to detect temporal changes in mammograms, another considerable reduction in false positives seems possible},

We have applied a member of this family, a discrete dynamic contour model, to the task of mass segmentation in digital mammograms. The method was compared to a recently published region growing method on a dataset of 214 mammograms. Both methods need a starting point. In a first experiment, for each mass the center of gravity of the annotation was used. In a second experiment, a pixel-based initial detection step was used to generate starting points. The latter starting points are often located less proper for good segmentation, requiring the methods to be robust. The performance was measured using an overlap criterion based on the annotation made by an experienced radiologist and the segmented region. The discrete contour model proved to be a robust method to segment masses, and outperformed a probabilistic region growing method. However, just like for the region growing methods, a good choice for the seed point appeared to be of great importance.},

  abstract = {We have developed a breast coordinate system that is based on breast anatomy to register female breasts into a common coordinate frame in 2D mediolateral (ML) or mediolateral oblique (MLO) view mammograms. The breasts are registered according to the location of the pectoral muscle and the nipple and the shape of the breast boundary because these are the most robust features independent of the breast size and shape. On the basis of these landmarks, we have constructed a nonlinear mapping between the parameter frame and the breast region in the mammogram. This mapping makes it possible to identify the corresponding positions and orientations among all of the ML or MLO mammograms, which facilitates an implicit use of the registration, i.e., no explicit image warping is needed. We additionally show how the coordinate transform can be used to extract Gaussian derivative features so that the feature positions and orientations are registered and extracted without non-linearly deforming the images. We use the proposed breast coordinate transform in a cross-sectional breast cancer risk assessment study of 490 women, in which we attempt to learn breast cancer risk factors from mammograms that were taken prior to when the breast cancer became visible to a radiologist. The coordinate system provides both the relative position and orientation information on the breast region from which the features are derived. In addition, the coordinate system can be used in temporal studies to pin-point anatomically equivalent locations between the mammograms of each woman and among the mammograms of all of the women in the study. The results of the cross-sectional study show that the classification into cancer and control groups can be improved by using the new coordinate system, compared to other systems evaluated. Comparisons were performed using the area-under-the-receiveroperating- characteristic-curve (AUC) score. In general, the new coordinate system makes an accurate anatomical registration of breasts possible, which suggests its wide applicability wherever 2D mammogram registration is required.},

  abstract = {Using combinations of different volumetric datasets is becoming more common in scientific applications, especially medical environments such as neurosurgery where multiple imaging modalities are required to provide insight to both anatomical and functional structures in the brain. Such data sets are usually in different orientations and have different resolutions. Furthermore, it is often interesting, e.g. for surgical planning or intraoperative applications to add the visualization of foreign objects (e.g., surgical tools, reference grids, 3D measurement widgets). We propose a flexible framework based on GPU-accelerated ray-casting and depth peeling, that allows volume rendering of multiple, arbitrarily positioned volumes intersected with opaque or translucent geometric objects. These objects can also be used as convex or concave clipping shapes. We consider the main contribution of our work to be the flexible combination of the above-mentioned features in a single framework. As such, it can serve as a basis for neurosurgery applications but also for other fields where multi-volume rendering is important.},

Usually the fiber tracking parameters are set once and are then re-used for several patient datasets. However, the stability of the chosen parameters is not evaluated and a small change in the parameter values can give very different results. The user remains completely unaware of such effects. Furthermore, it is difficult to reproduce output results between different users. We propose a visualization tool that allows the user to visually explore how small variations in parameter values affect the output of fiber tracking. With this knowledge the user cannot only assess the stability of commonly used parameter values but also evaluate in a more reliable way the output results between different patients. Existing tools do not provide such information. A small user evaluation of our tool has been done to show the potential of the technique.},

However, the output of fiber tracking contains a significant amount of uncertainty accumulated in the various steps of the processing pipeline. Existing DTI visualization methods do not present these uncertainties to the end-user. This creates a false impression of precision and accuracy that can have serious consequences in applications that rely heavily on risk assessment and decision-making, such as neurosurgery. On the other hand, adding uncertainty to an already complex visualization can easily lead to information overload and visual clutter. In this work, we propose Illustrative Confidence Intervals to reduce the complexity of the visualization and present only those aspects of uncertainty that are of interest to the user. We look specifically at the uncertainty in fiber shape due to noise and modeling errors. To demonstrate the flexibility of our framework, we compute this uncertainty in two different ways, based on (1) fiber distance and (2) the probability of a fiber connection between two brain regions. We provide the user with interactive tools to define multiple confidence intervals, specify visual styles and explore the uncertainty with a Focus+Context approach. Finally, we have conducted a user evaluation with three neurosurgeons to evaluate the added value of our visualization.},

  title = {Visualization of uncertainty in fiber tracking based on diffusion tensor imaging},
  year = {2012},
  url = {http://repository.tue.nl/732944},
  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an imaging technique based on magnetic resonance that describes, in each point of the tissue, the distribution of diffusing water molecules. The distribution is mathematically modelled using a second-order tensor. In fibrous tissues the diffusion tensor will have an elongated, ellipsoid shape whose main axis is assumed to be aligned with the underlying fiber structure. Fiber tractography traces paths through the tensor field by following each tensor's main direction thereby resulting in a three-dimensional reconstruction of the fibers. This is particularly interesting for the exploration and visualization of neuronal connections in brain white matter and has great potential for applications in neuroscience and neurosurgery. DTI and fiber tractography are unique in that they provide insight into white matter structures in vivo and non-invasively. However, despite these capabilities the application of DTI and fiber tractography in clinical practice remains limited. The image acquisition and post-processing pipeline is complex and consists of many stages. At each stage errors and uncertainties are introduced due to image noise, magnetic distortions, partial volume effects, scanner settings, diffusion model assumptions and user parameters. These uncertainties are propagated through the pipeline and possibly enhanced in subsequent stages thereby leading to potentially unreliable results in the final tractography output. To the user the processing pipeline behaves like a black box whose internal details remain hidden and whose quality of output cannot be reliably assessed. Contrary to standard CT and MR images it is not possible to look at the "raw" diffusion-weighted images. Without further processing the images are practically meaningless. This means the user either has to accept (and trust) the processing output or refrain from using fiber tracking all together. In this thesis we assume that the user has certain reservations about the quality of the tractography output. Unfortunately, there is no gold standard against which the output of tractography can be validated. Consequently, we cannot make definitive statements about the "true" certainty or uncertainty of fiber reconstructions. We can, however, discuss tractography output in terms of stability and reproducibility. The output of tractography algorithms can be subject to large variations. In this thesis we present a number of visualization strategies that make these variations visible to the user and allow a better assessment of the reliability of fiber reconstructions obtained from any given tractography algorithm.},

Automating the interpretation has the potential to overcome this drawback and to deliver objective and reproducible results. The CAD4TB software is a computer-aided detection system that has shown promising preliminary findings. Evaluation studies in different settings are needed to assess diagnostic accuracy and practicability of use.CAD4TB was evaluated on chest radiographs of patients with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis enrolled in two cohort studies in Tanzania. All patients were characterized by sputum smear microscopy and culture including subsequent antigen or molecular confirmation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) to determine the reference standard. Chest radiographs were read by the software and two human readers, one expert reader and one clinical officer. The sensitivity and specificity of CAD4TB was depicted using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the area under the curve calculated and the performance of the software compared to the results of human readers.Of 861 study participants, 194 (23\%) were culture-positive for M.tb. The area under the ROC curve of CAD4TB for the detection of culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis was 0.84 (95\% CI 0.80-0.88). CAD4TB was significantly more accurate for the discrimination of smear-positive cases against non TB patients than for smear-negative cases (p-value<0.01). It differentiated better between TB cases and non TB patients among HIV-negative compared to HIV-positive individuals (p<0.01). CAD4TB significantly outperformed the clinical officer, but did not reach the accuracy of the expert reader (pAC/a,!A =AC/a,!A 0.02), for a tuberculosis specific reading threshold.CAD4TB accurately distinguished between the chest radiographs of culture-positive TB cases and controls. Further studies on cost-effectiveness, operational and ethical aspects should determine its place in diagnostic and screening algorithms.},

  abstract = {Finding abnormalities in diagnostic images is a difficult task even for expert radiologists because the normal tissue locations largely outnumber those with suspicious signs which may thus be missed or incorrectly interpreted. For the same reason the design of a Computer-Aided Detection (CADe) system is very complex because the large predominance of normal samples in the training data may hamper the ability of the classifier to recognize the abnormalities on the images. In this paper we present a novel approach for computer-aided detection which faces the class imbalance with a cascade of boosting classifiers where each node is trained by a learning algorithm based on ranking instead of classification error. Such approach is used to design a system (CasCADe) for the automated detection of clustered microcalcifications (AZA 1/4 Cs), which is a severely unbalanced classification problem because of the vast majority of image locations where no AZA 1/4 C is present. The proposed approach was evaluated with a dataset of 1599 full-field digital mammograms from 560 cases and compared favorably with the Hologic R2CAD ImageChecker, one of the most widespread commercial CADe systems. In particular, at the same lesion sensitivity of R2CAD (90\%) on biopsy proven malignant cases, CasCADe and R2CAD detected 0.13 and 0.21 false positives per image (FPpi), respectively (p-value=0.09), whereas at the same FPpi of R2CAD (0.21), CasCADe and R2CAD detected 93\% and 90\% of true lesions respectively (p-value=0.11) thus showing that CasCADe can compete with high-end CADe commercial systems.},

Quantum noise removal or equalization has been shown to be an important step in the automatic detection of microcalcifications. However, it is often limited by the difficulty of robustly estimating the noise parameters on the images. In this study, a nonparametric image intensity transformation method that equalizes quantum noise in digital mammograms is described. A simple Look-Up-Table for Quantum Noise Equalization (LUT-QNE) is determined based on the assumption that noise properties do not vary significantly across the images. This method was evaluated on a dataset of 252 raw digital mammograms by comparing noise statistics before and after applying LUT-QNE. Performance was also tested as a preprocessing step in two microcalcification detection schemes. Results show that the proposed method statistically significantly improves microcalcification detection performance.},

Recent advances in Computer-Aided Detection (CADe) for the automatic detection of clustered microcalcifications on mammograms show that cascade classifiers can compete with high-end commercial systems. In this paper, we introduce a deep cascade detector where the learning algorithm of each binary pixel classifier has been redesigned in the early stopping mechanism conventionally used to avoid overfitting to the training data. In this way, we strongly increase the number of features considered in each stage of the cascade (hence the term "deep"), yet we still benefit from the cascade framework by obtaining a very fast processing of mammograms (less than one second per image). We evaluated the proposed approach on a database of full-field digital mammograms; the experiments revealed a statistically significant improvement of deep cascade with respect to the traditional cascade framework. We also obtained statistically significantly higher performance than one of the most wide-spread commercial CADe systems, the Hologic R2CAD ImageChecker. Specifically, at the same number of false positives per image of R2CAD (0.21), the deep cascade detected 96 % of true lesions against the 90 % of R2CAD, whereas at the same lesion sensitivity of R2CAD (90 %), we obtained 0.05 false positives per image for the deep cascade against the 0.21 of R2CAD.},

These lesions appear on mammograms as tiny deposits of calcium smaller than 20 pixels in diameter. At this scale, high frequency image noise is dominated by quantum noise, which in raw mammograms can be described with a squareroot noise model. Under this assumption, we derive an adaptive variance stabilizing transform (VST) that stabilizes the noise to unitary standard deviation in all the images. This is achieved by estimating the noise characteristics from the image at hand. We tested the adaptive VST as a preprocessing stage for four existing computerized MC detection methods on three datasets acquired with mammographic units from different manufacturers. In all the test cases considered, MC detection performance on transformed mammograms was statistically significantly higher than on unprocessed mammograms. Results were also superior in comparison with a 'fixed' (nonparametric) VST previously proposed for digital mammograms.},

To provide our initial clinical experience of this technique and comparison to iodine maps derived from dual energy imaging CONTENT ORGANIZATION A. Principles B. Data acquisition C. Postprocessing: Registration, motion correction and filtering D. Clinical examples E. Comparison with dual energy CT F. Advantages and limitations SUMMARY Iodine maps derived from dual energy CT have been successfully used for assessment of acute pulmonary embolism. We present technical principles and initial results of a technique deriving iodine maps from subtracting precontrast scans from pulmonary CTA. Accurate image registration is crucial: Artifacts may arise from pulsation, motion or differences in inspiratory level. With good registration, partially obstructed vessels can be distinguished from complete occlusions and correlated with perfusion defects in the lung parenchyma. Color coding of lung parenchyma can enhance perfusion differences at a quality that is superior to iodine maps from dual energy imaging. Radiation dose can be kept below 5 mSv for standard size patients. This subtraction technique allows for excellent evaluation of lung parenchyma and pulmonary vessels and achieves a more than 3 times higher contrast-to-noise ratio than dual energy images at identical dose.},

The resulting features of the extracted shapes, completed the data for a <color,texture, shape>-vector. Combined with the intersection distance measure, this vector is used for {OBIR}, as are its components. Although shape matching by itself provides good results, the complete vector outperforms its components, with up to 80% precision.

In two separate experiments, color and gray scale versions of 180 textures, drawn from the {OuTex} and {VisTex} texture databases were clustered by 34 subjects. The mutual agreement among these subjects was 51% and 52% for, respectively, the experiments with color and gray scale textures. The average agreement between the k-means algorithm and the participants was 36%, where k-means approximated some participants up to 60%. Since last yearA-A?A 1/2 s results were not replicated, an additional data analysis was developed, which uses the semantic labels available in the database. This analysis shows that semantics play an important role in human texture clustering and once more illustrate the complexity of texture recognition. The current findings, the introduction of {M-HinTS}, and the set of analyzes discussed, are the start of a next phase in unraveling human texture recognition.},

Next to these regular papers, we invited researchers to join in two comparative studies where algorithms were applied to a common data set, and submit a paper to the workshop about their system. The first of these challenges is EXACT09, on the extraction of the pulmonary airway tree from CT data. The second one, VOLCANO'09, is on the analysis of size changes in pulmonary nodules from consecutive CT scans. The results of these challenges are described in two overview papers that can be found in these proceedings.

  abstract = {Segmentation of thrombus in abdominal aortic aneurysms is complicated by regions of low boundary contrast and by the presence of many neighboring structures in close proximity to the aneurysm wall. This paper presents an automated method that is similar to the well known Active Shape Models (ASM), which combine a three-dimensional shape model with a one-dimensional boundary appearance model. Our contribution is twofold: First, we show how the generalizability of a shape model of curvilinear objects can be improved by modeling the objects axis deformation independent of its cross-sectional deformation. Second, a non-parametric appearance modeling scheme that effectively deals with a highly varying background is presented. In contrast with the conventional ASM approach, the new appearance model trains on both true and false examples of boundary profiles. The probability that a given image profile belongs to the boundary is obtained using k nearest neighbor (kNN) probability density estimation. The performance of this scheme is compared to that of original ASMs, which minimize the Mahalanobis distance to the average true profile in the training set. A set of leave-one-out experiments is performed on 23 datasets. Modeling the axis and cross-section separately reduces the shape reconstruction error in all cases. The average reconstruction error was reduced from 2.2 to 1.6 mm. Segmentation using the kNN appearance model significantly outperforms the original ASM scheme; average volume errors are 5.9% and 46% respectively.},

Of these 70 publications, 33 presented quantitatively validated results. There is still no consensus on which targeting technique to use for surgery planning; methods vary greatly between centers. Some groups apply indirect methods involving anatomical landmarks, or atlases incorporating anatomical or functional data. Others perform direct visualization on MR imaging, using T2-weighted spin echo or inversion recovery protocols. The combined studies do not offer a straightforward conclusion on the best targeting protocol. Indirect methods are not patient specific, leading to varying results between cases. On the other hand, direct targeting on MR imaging suffers from lack of contrast within the subthalamic region, resulting in a poor delineation of the STN. These deficiencies result in a need for intraoperative adaptation of the original target based on test stimulation with or without microelectrode recording. It is expected that future advances in MR imaging technology will lead to improvements in direct targeting. The use of new MR imaging modalities such as diffusion MR imaging might even lead to the specific identification of the different functional parts of the STN, such as the dorsolateral sensorimotor part, the target for deep brain stimulation.},

  title = {Hitting the right target : noninvasive localization of the subthalamic nucleus motor part for specific deep brain stimulation},
  year = {2011},
  url = {http://repository.tue.nl/715250},
  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has gained momentum as a therapy for advanced ParkinsonA-A?A 1/2 s disease. The stimulation effectively alleviates the patientsA-A?A 1/2  typical motor symptoms on a long term, but can give rise to cognitive and psychiatric adverse effects as well. Based on primate studies, the STN has been divided into three functionally different parts, which were distinguished by their afferent and efferent connections. The largest part is the motor area, followed by an associative and a limbic area. The serious adverse effects on cognition and behavior occurring after deep brain stimulation are assumed to be caused by electrical current spread to the associative and limbic areas of the STN. Therefore, selective stimulation of the motor part of the STN seems crucial, both to obtain the best possible therapeutic effect on the motor symptoms and to minimize the debilitating effects on cognition and behavior. However, current medical imaging techniques do not yet facilitate the required accurate identification of the STN itself, let alone its different functional areas. The final target for DBS is still often adjusted using intraoperative electrophysiology. Therefore, in this thesis we aimed to improve imaging for deep brain stimulation using noninvasive MRI protocols, in order to identify the STN and its motor part. We studied the advantages and drawbacks of already available noninvasive methods to target the STN. This review did not lead to a straightforward conclusion; identification of the STN motor part remained an open question. In follow-up on this question, we investigated the possibility to distinguish the different functional STN parts based on their connectivity information. Three types of information were carefully analyzed in this thesis. First, we looked into the clustering of local diffusion information within the STN region. We visually inspected the complex diffusion profiles, derived from postmortem rat brain data with high angular resolution, and augmented this manual segmentation method using k-means and graph cuts clustering. Because the weighing of different orders of diffusion information in the traditionally used L2 norm on the orientation distribution functions (ODFs) remained an open issue, we developed a specialized distance measure, the so-called Sobolev norm. This norm does not only take into account the amplitudes of the diffusion profiles, but also their extrema. We showed it to perform better than the L2 norm on synthetic phantom data and real brain (thalamus) data. The research done on this topic facilitates better classification by clustering of gray matter structures in the (deep) brain. Secondly, we were the first to analyze the STNA-A?A 1/2 s full structural connectivity, based on probabilistic fiber tracking in diffusion MRI data of healthy volunteers. The results correspond well to topical literature on STN projections. Furthermore, we assessed the structural connectivity per voxel of the STN seed region and discovered a gradient in connectivity to the premotor cortex within the STN. While going from the medial to the lateral part of the STN, the connectivity increases, confirming the expected lateral location of the STN motor part. Finally, the connectivity analysis produced evidence for the existence of a A-A?A 1/2 hyperdirect?? pathway between the motor cortex and the STN in humans, which is very useful for future research into stimulation targets. The results of these experiments indicate that it is possible to find the motor part of the STN as specific target for deep brain stimulation using structural connectivity information acquired in a noninvasive way. Third and last, we studied functional connectivity using resting state functional MRI data of healthy volunteers. The resulting significant clusters provided us with the first complete description of the STNA-A?A 1/2 s resting state functional connectivity, which corresponds with the expectations based on available literature. Moreover, we performed a reverse regression procedure with the average time
                             series signals in motor and limbic areas as principal regressors. The results were analyzed for each STN voxel separately and also showed mediolateral gradients in functional connectivity within the STN. The lateral STN part exhibited more motor connectivity, while the medial part seemed to be more functionally connected to limbic brain areas, as described in neuronal tracer studies. These results show that functional connectivity analysis also is a viable noninvasive method to find the motor part of the STN. The work on noninvasive MRI methods for identification of the STN and its functional parts, as presented in this thesis, thus contributes to future specific stimulation of the motor part of the STN for deep brain stimulation in patients with ParkinsonA-A?A 1/2 s disease. This may help to maximize the motor effects and minimize severe cognitive and psychiatric side effects.},

Identification of the motor part of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) as part of the presurgical workup could minimize these adverse effects. In this study, we assessed the STN's connectivity to motor, associative, and limbic brain areas, based on structural and functional connectivity analysis of volunteer data. For the structural connectivity, we used streamline counts derived from HARDI fiber tracking. The resulting tracks supported the existence of the so-called "hyperdirect" pathway in humans. Furthermore, we determined the connectivity of each STN voxel with the motor cortical areas. Functional connectivity was calculated based on functional MRI, as the correlation of the signal within a given brain voxel with the signal in the STN. Also, the signal per STN voxel was explained in terms of the correlation with motor or limbic brain seed ROI areas. Both right and left STN ROIs appeared to be structurally and functionally connected to brain areas that are part of the motor, associative, and limbic circuit. Furthermore, this study enabled us to assess the level of segregation of the STN motor part, which is relevant for the planning of STN DBS procedures.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Purpose: To develop a fully automatic deep learning method for 3D segmentation of the spleen on computed tomography (CT) scans and to compare the automatically measured spleen volume with the standard splenic index approximation formula that requires three 2D manual measurements. Method and Materials:145 CT thorax-abdomen scans were collected from our institute. All scans were contrast enhanced and acquired with a slice thickness of 1 or 2 mm. The spleens were manually segmented in 3D by trained human observers in all scans. We used 100 scans for training and 45 scans as an independent test set. In the test set, the standard approximation formula was applied by a human observer to get an estimation of the splenic volume. The system fully analyzes the entire thorax-abdomen CT scan to segment the exact location of the spleen, without any need for pre-processing. Multiple U-net convolutional neural networks were trained for different orthogonal directions using the training data set. A validation set consisting of 30% of the training data was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the neural network. A dedicated hard mining selection strategy was employed to improve the learning process. The predictions of the U-nets were averaged and subsequently thresholded to obtain a 3D spleen segmentation. The mean absolute error of the splenic volume was used to measure the accuracy of the deep learning approach and the standard approximation formula in comparison to the manual reference standard. The performance of the deep learning approach was also evaluated by computing the Dice similarity coefficient on the test set. Results: The deep learning approach resulted in a mean absolute error of 8.5% (SD 11.6) in the splenic volume while the approximation formula gave a significantly higher (p<0.01) mean absolute error of 17.7% (SD 14.7). The average Dice score between the deep learning segmentations and the reference segmentations was 0.91 (SD 0.08). Conclusion: Splenic volume can be fully automatically assessed using a U-net deep learning approach, with an accuracy that is substantially better than the clinically widely used approximation formula. Clinical relevance/Application: An accurate splenic volume measurement can be used for assessing splenomegaly and for detecting changes in splenic volume over time.},

  abstract = {Prostate cancer is generally graded by pathologists based on hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained slides. Because of the large size of the tumor areas in radical prostatectomies (RP), this task can be tedious and error prone with known high interobserver variability. Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled development of automated systems that may assist pathologists in prostate diagnostics. As prostate cancer originates from glandular tissue, an important prerequisite for development of such algorithms is the possibility to automatically differentiate between glandular tissue and other tissues. In this paper, we propose a method for automatically segmenting epithelial tissue in digitally scanned prostatectomy slides based on deep learning. We collected 30 single-center whole mount tissue sections, with reported Gleason growth patterns ranging from 3 to 5, from 27 patients that underwent RP. Two different network architectures, U-Net and regular fully convolutional networks with varying depths, were trained using a set of sparsely annotated slides. We evaluated the trained networks on exhaustively annotated regions from a separate test set. The test set contained both healthy and cancerous epithelium with different Gleason growth patterns. The results show the effectiveness of our approach given a pixel-based AUC score of 0.97. Our method contains no prior assumptions on glandular morphology, does not directly rely on the presence of lumina and all features are learned by the network itself. The generated segmentation can be used to highlight regions of interest for pathologists and to improve cancer annotations to further enhance an automatic cancer grading system.},

We propose a new deep learning method to segment epithelial tissue in digitised hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained prostatectomy slides using immunohistochemistry (IHC) as reference standard. We used IHC to create a precise and objective ground truth compared to manual outlining on H&E slides, especially in areas with high-grade PCa. 102 tissue sections were stained with H&E and subsequently restained with P63 and CK8/18 IHC markers to highlight epithelial structures. Afterwards each pair was co-registered. First, we trained a U-Net to segment epithelial structures in IHC using a subset of the IHC slides that were preprocessed with color deconvolution. Second, this network was applied to the remaining slides to create the reference standard used to train a second U-Net on H\&E. Our system accurately segmented both intact glands and individual tumour epithelial cells. The generalisation capacity of our system is shown using an independent external dataset from a different centre. We envision this segmentation as the first part of a fully automated prostate cancer grading pipeline.},

  booktitle = {United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology (USCAP) 108th Annual Meeting},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Grading prostate cancer is a time-consuming process and suffers from high inter- and intra-observer variability. Advances in computer-aided diagnosis have shown promise in improving histopathological diagnosis. We trained a deep learning system using data retrieved from the patients records to grade digitized prostate biopsies. Our system is the first that can automatically classify background, benign epithelium, Gleason 3, 4, and 5 on a gland-by-gland level in prostate biopsies. 532 glass slides containing 2162 prostate biopsies, evaluated by an experienced urogenital pathologist were collected and scanned. 596 biopsies were kept separate for evaluation, the remaining 1576 were used to train the deep learning algorithm (see table for Gleason grade distribution). A single label denoting the Gleason score (e.g. 3+4=7) was available for each biopsy, without information on tumor location or volume. To generate detailed annotations for training we used two previously trained deep learning networks to first segment the epithelium and, subsequently, to detect cancer. The Gleason grade from the patient record was assigned to the cancerous epithelium. These generated weakly annotated regions of tumor were then used to train a Gleason grading system. To evaluate, the system was applied to the biopsies in the test set. We used the total predicted surface area of each growth pattern to determine the Gleason score of the biopsy. Predicted tumor areas smaller than 15% of total epithelial tissue were considered unreliable (e.g. incomplete glands at the edges of the biopsy) and ignored for slide level classification. For predicted grades only areas larger than 5% of all epithelial tissue were considered, which is also common in clinical practice. Predicting whether a biopsy contains tumor resulted in an accuracy of 86% (linear weighted kappa (k) of 0.73, area under the ROC curve of 0.96). We compared the predicted primary Gleason grade to the one from the pathologists' report. Our system achieved an accuracy of 75% (k 0.64). On predicting the Grade Group (using primary and secondary pattern), our system achieved an accuracy of 67% (k 0.57). Misclassifications of more than one grade are rare. Our deep learning system automatically identifies Gleason patterns and benign tissue on a gland-by-gland basis. This can be used to determine the biopsy-level Grade Group and Gleason score, and show which parts of the tissue contribute to this prediction. Improvements need to be made to decrease misclassifications, for example in areas with inflammation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:
                             The Gleason score is the strongest correlating predictor of recurrence for prostate cancer, but has substantial inter-observer variability, limiting its usefulness for individual patients. Specialised urological pathologists have greater concordance; however, such expertise is not widely available. Prostate cancer diagnostics could thus benefit from robust, reproducible Gleason grading. We aimed to investigate the potential of deep learning to perform automated Gleason grading of prostate biopsies.

                             METHODS:
                             In this retrospective study, we developed a deep-learning system to grade prostate biopsies following the Gleason grading standard. The system was developed using randomly selected biopsies, sampled by the biopsy Gleason score, from patients at the Radboud University Medical Center (pathology report dated between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2017). A semi-automatic labelling technique was used to circumvent the need for manual annotations by pathologists, using pathologists' reports as the reference standard during training. The system was developed to delineate individual glands, assign Gleason growth patterns, and determine the biopsy-level grade. For validation of the method, a consensus reference standard was set by three expert urological pathologists on an independent test set of 550 biopsies. Of these 550, 100 were used in an observer experiment, in which the system, 13 pathologists, and two pathologists in training were compared with respect to the reference standard. The system was also compared to an external test dataset of 886 cores, which contained 245 cores from a different centre that were independently graded by two pathologists.

                             FINDINGS:
                             We collected 5759 biopsies from 1243 patients. The developed system achieved a high agreement with the reference standard (quadratic Cohen's kappa 0*918, 95% CI 0*891-0*941) and scored highly at clinical decision thresholds: benign versus malignant (area under the curve 0*990, 95% CI 0*982-0*996), grade group of 2 or more (0*978, 0*966-0*988), and grade group of 3 or more (0*974, 0*962-0*984). In an observer experiment, the deep-learning system scored higher (kappa 0*854) than the panel (median kappa 0*819), outperforming 10 of 15 pathologist observers. On the external test dataset, the system obtained a high agreement with the reference standard set independently by two pathologists (quadratic Cohen's kappa 0*723 and 0*707) and within inter-observer variability (kappa 0*71).

                             INTERPRETATION:
                             Our automated deep-learning system achieved a performance similar to pathologists for Gleason grading and could potentially contribute to prostate cancer diagnosis. The system could potentially assist pathologists by screening biopsies, providing second opinions on grade group, and presenting quantitative measurements of volume percentages.

  abstract = {The Gleason score is the most important prognostic marker for prostate cancer patients, but it suffers from significant observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on deep learning can achieve pathologist-level performance at Gleason grading. However, the performance of such systems can degrade in the presence of artifacts, foreign tissue, or other anomalies. Pathologists integrating their expertise with feedback from an AI system could result in a synergy that outperforms both the individual pathologist and the system. Despite the hype around AI assistance, existing literature on this topic within the pathology domain is limited. We investigated the value of AI assistance for grading prostate biopsies. A panel of 14 observers graded 160 biopsies with and without AI assistance. Using AI, the agreement of the panel with an expert reference standard increased significantly (quadratically weighted Cohen's kappa, 0.799 vs. 0.872; p = 0.019). On an external validation set of 87 cases, the panel showed a significant increase in agreement with a panel of international experts in prostate pathology (quadratically weighted Cohen's kappa, 0.733 vs. 0.786; p = 0.003). In both experiments, on a group-level, AI-assisted pathologists outperformed the unassisted pathologists and the standalone AI system. Our results show the potential of AI systems for Gleason grading, but more importantly, show the benefits of pathologist-AI synergy.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise for diagnosing prostate cancer in biopsies. However, results have been limited to individual studies, lacking validation in multinational settings. Competitions have been shown to be accelerators for medical imaging innovations, but their impact is hindered by lack of reproducibility and independent validation. With this in mind, we organized the PANDA challenge--the largest histopathology competition to date, joined by 1,290 developers--to catalyze development of reproducible AI algorithms for Gleason grading using 10,616 digitized prostate biopsies. We validated that a diverse set of submitted algorithms reached pathologist-level performance on independent cross-continental cohorts, fully blinded to the algorithm developers. On United States and European external validation sets, the algorithms achieved agreements of 0.862 (quadratically weighted k, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.840-0.884) and 0.868 (95% CI, 0.835-0.900) with expert uropathologists. Successful generalization across different patient populations, laboratories and reference standards, achieved by a variety of algorithmic approaches, warrants evaluating AI-based Gleason grading in prospective clinical trials.},

  abstract = {The histological grading of prostate biopsies is a crucial element in the diagnostic pathway of prostate cancer. The known high inter- and intraobserver variability show potential and a need for assisting pathologists in this task. Furthermore, a global shortage of pathologists stresses the demand for reproducible, more efficient, and easily accessible diagnostic solutions. This thesis's primary aim was to investigate and design an AI-based system to detect and grade prostate cancer in biopsies. A second aim was to evaluate the potential clinical merits of AI-assisted grading when such systems are embedded in the pathologist's workflow. To this extent, the following objectives were undertaken as part of this thesis:

   1. The development of an automated system that can distinguish epithelial tissue from other tissue types within H&E stained prostate specimens (Chapter 2);
   2. The development and validation of an automated system for grading prostate biopsies using the Gleason grading system (Chapter 3);
   3. A multi-center independent evaluation of state-of-the-art algorithms for automated Gleason grading sourced through a large-scale medical AI competition(Chapter 4);
   4. The investigation of the potential merits of AI-assisted grading of prostate cancer through an observer study (Chapter 5).},

  abstract = {Despite inhaled medications that decrease exacerbation risk, some COPD patients experience frequent exacerbations. We determined prospective risk factors for exacerbations among subjects in the COPDGene Study taking inhaled medications.2113 COPD subjects were categorized into four medication use patterns: triple therapy with tiotropium (TIO) plus long-acting beta-agonist/inhaled-corticosteroid (ICS), tiotropium alone, ICS, and short-acting bronchodilators. Self-reported exacerbations were recorded in telephone and web-based longitudinal follow-up surveys. Associations with exacerbations were determined within each medication group using four separate logistic regression models. A head-to-head analysis compared exacerbation risk among subjects using tiotropium vs. ICS.In separate logistic regression models, the presence of gastroesophageal reflux, female gender, and higher scores on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire were significant predictors of exacerbator status within multiple medication groups (reflux: OR 1.62-2.75; female gender: OR 1.53 - OR 1.90; SGRQ: OR 1.02-1.03). Subjects taking either ICS or tiotropium had similar baseline characteristics, allowing comparison between these two groups. In the head-to-head comparison, tiotropium users showed a trend towards lower rates of exacerbations (OR=0.69 [95 \% CI 0.45, 1.06], p=0.09) compared with ICS users, especially in subjects without comorbid asthma (OR=0.56 [95\% CI 0.31, 1.00], p=0.05).Each common COPD medication usage group showed unique risk factor patterns associated with increased risk of exacerbations, which may help clinicians identify subjects at risk. Compared to similar subjects using ICS, those taking tiotropium showed a trend towards reduced exacerbation risk, especially in subjects without asthma.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00608764, first received 1/28/2008.},

  abstract = {We propose a method to identify breast parenchyma regions containing mass-like abnormalities in dedicated breast CT images using texture feature descriptors. From 53 complete patient breast CT scans (29 of which containing masses), we first isolated the breast parenchyma through automatic segmentation, and we collected a total of 14,751 normal 2-D image patches (negatives), and 525 containing a breast mass (positives). We extracted 141 texture features (10 first-order descriptors, 6 Haralick features, 20 run-length features, 45 structural and pattern descriptors, 60 Gabor features), which we then analyzed through multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and linear discriminant analysis, and which resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92. We finally trained and validated a neural network using these data, dividing them into multiple batches, with each batch always containing the whole set of positive cases, and as many different negative examples. To avoid the possible bias due to the high skewness in class proportion, the training was performed on all these batches independently, without re-initializing the network weights after each training. The network was tested using an additional independent 18 patient breast CT scans (8 normal and 10 containing a mass), on a total of 6,635 image patches (213 positives, 6,422 negatives) which were not used during the training/validation phase, and resulted in a precision of 94.8%, a recall of 93.9%, and an AUC of 0.99. Our results suggest that the proposed approach could be further evaluated and expanded for computer-aided detection tasks in breast CT imaging.},

Since medical facilities around the world differ enormously in what laboratory tests or chest imaging may be available, DFCN is designed to be robust to missing input data. An ablation study extensively evaluates the performance benefits of the DFCN as well as its robustness to missing inputs. Data from 1088 patients with confirmed RT-PCR results are obtained from two independent medical facilities. The data includes results from 27 laboratory tests and a chest x-ray scored by a deep learning model. Training and test datasets are taken from different medical facilities. Data is made publicly available. The performance of DFCN in predicting the RT-PCR result is compared with 3 related architectures as well as a Random Forest baseline. All models are trained with varying levels of masked input data to encourage robustness to missing inputs. Missing data is simulated at test time by masking inputs randomly. DFCN outperforms all other models with statistical significance using random subsets of input data with 2-27 available inputs. When all 28 inputs are available DFCN obtains an AUC of 0.924, higher than any other model. Furthermore, with clinically meaningful subsets of parameters consisting of just 6 and 7 inputs respectively, DFCN achieves higher AUCs than any other model, with values of 0.909 and 0.919.},

  abstract = {We propose a deep learning system to automatically detect four explainable emphysema signs on frontal and lateral chest radiographs. Frontal and lateral chest radiographs from 3000 studies were retrospectively collected. Two radiologists annotated these with 4 radiological signs of pulmonary emphysema identified from the literature. A patient with >=2 of these signs present is considered emphysema positive. Using separate deep learning systems for frontal and lateral images we predict the presence of each of the four visual signs and use these to determine emphysema positivity. The ROC and AUC results on a set of 422 held-out cases, labeled by both radiologists, are reported. Comparison with a black-box model which predicts emphysema without the use of explainable visual features is made on the annotations from both radiologists, as well as the subset that they agreed on. DeLong's test is used to compare with the black-box model ROC and McNemar's test to compare with radiologist performance. In 422 test cases, emphysema positivity was predicted with AUCs of 0.924 and 0.946 using the reference standard from each radiologist separately. Setting model sensitivity equivalent to that of the second radiologist, our model has a comparable specificity (p = 0.880 and p = 0.143 for each radiologist respectively). Our method is comparable with the black-box model with AUCs of 0.915 (p = 0.407) and 0.935 (p = 0.291), respectively. On the 370 cases where both radiologists agreed (53 positives), our model achieves an AUC of 0.981, again comparable to the black-box model AUC of 0.972 (p = 0.289). Our proposed method can predict emphysema positivity on chest radiographs as well as a radiologist or a comparable black-box method. It additionally produces labels for four visual signs to ensure the explainability of the result. The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6373392.},

  volume = {PP},
  abstract = {An important limitation of state-of-the-art deep learning networks is that they do not recognize when their input is dissimilar to the data on which they were trained and proceed to produce outputs that will be unreliable or nonsensical. In this work, we describe FRODO (Free Rejection of Out-of-Distribution), a publicly available method that can be easily employed for any trained network to detect input data from a different distribution than is expected. FRODO uses the statistical distribution of intermediate layer outputs to define the expected in-distribution (ID) input image properties. New samples are judged based on the Mahalanobis distance (MD) of their layer outputs from the defined distribution. The method can be applied to any network, and we demonstrate the performance of FRODO in correctly rejecting OOD samples on three distinct architectures for classification, localization, and segmentation tasks in chest X-rays. A dataset of 21,576 X-ray images with 3,655 in-distribution samples is defined for testing. The remaining images are divided into four OOD categories of varying levels of difficulty, and performance at rejecting each type is evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. FRODO achieves areas under the ROC (AUC) of between 0.815 and 0.999 in distinguishing OOD samples of different types. This is shown to be comparable with the best-performing state-of-the-art method tested, with the substantial advantage that FRODO integrates seamlessly with any network and requires no extra model to be constructed and trained.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study used intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to evaluate radial artery volume changes after intraarterial administration of nitroglycerin and/or verapamil. BACKGROUND: Radial artery spasm, which is associated with radial artery size, is the main limitation of the transradial approach in percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). METHODS: This prospective, randomized study compared the effect of two intra-arterial vasodilator regimens on radial artery volume: 0.2 mg of nitroglycerin plus 2.5 mg of verapamil (Group 1; n = 15) versus 2.5 mg of verapamil alone (Group 2; n = 15). Radial artery lumen volume was assessed using IVUS at two time points: at baseline (5 minutes after sheath insertion) and post-vasodilator (1 minute after drug administration). The luminal volume of the radial artery was computed using ECOC Random Fields (ECOC-RF), a technique used for automatic segmentation of luminal borders in longitudinal cut images from IVUS sequences. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in arterial lumen volume in both groups, with an increase from 451 A,A+- 177 mmA,A3 to 508 A,A+- 192 mmA,A3 (p = 0.001) in Group 1 and from 456 A,A+- 188 mmA,A3 to 509 A,A+- 170 mmA,A3 (p = 0.001) in Group 2. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of absolute volume increase (58 mmA,A3 versus 53 mmA,A3, respectively; p = 0.65) or in relative volume increase (14% versus 20%, respectively; p = 0.69). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of nitroglycerin plus verapamil or verapamil alone to the radial artery resulted in similar increases in arterial lumen volume according to ECOC-RF IVUS measurements.},

  abstract = {Synaptic morphology is tightly related to synaptic efficacy, and in many cases morphological synapse defects ultimately lead to synaptic malfunction. The Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a well-established model for glutamatergic synapses, has been extensively studied for decades. Identification of mutations causing NMJ morphological defects revealed a repertoire of genes that regulate synapse development and function. Many of these were identified in large-scale studies that focused on qualitative approaches to detect morphological abnormalities of the Drosophila NMJ. A drawback of qualitative analyses is that many subtle players contributing to NMJ morphology likely remain unnoticed. Whereas quantitative analyses are required to detect the subtler morphological differences, such analyses are not yet commonly performed because they are laborious. This protocol describes in detail two image analysis algorithms "Drosophila NMJ Morphometrics" and "Drosophila NMJ Bouton Morphometrics", available as Fiji-compatible macros, for quantitative, accurate and objective morphometric analysis of the Drosophila NMJ. This methodology is developed to analyze NMJ terminals immunolabeled with the commonly used markers Dlg-1 and Brp. Additionally, its wider application to other markers such as Hrp, Csp and Syt is presented in this protocol. The macros are able to assess nine morphological NMJ features: NMJ area, NMJ perimeter, number of boutons, NMJ length, NMJ longest branch length, number of islands, number of branches, number of branching points and number of active zones in the NMJ terminal.},

  abstract = {The presence of collateral blood flow is found to be a strong predictor of patient outcome after acute ischemic stroke. Collateral blood flow is defined as an alternative way to provide oxygenated blood to ischemic cerebral tissue. Assessment of collateral blood supply is currently performed by visual inspection of a Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) which introduces inter-observer variability and depends on the grading scale. Furthermore, variations in the arterial contrast arrival time may lead to underestimation of collateral blood supply in a CTA which exerts a negative influence on the prediction of patient outcome. In this study, the feasibility of a Computer-aided Diagnosis system is investigated capable of objectively predicting patient outcome. We present a novel automatic method for quantitative assessment of cerebral hypoperfusion in timing-invariant (i.e. delay insensitive) CTA (TI-CTA). The proposed Vessel Density Symmetry algorithm automatically generates descriptive maps based on hemispheric asymmetry of blood vessels. Intensity and symmetry based features are extracted from these descriptive maps and subjected to a best-first-search feature selection. Linear Discriminant Analysis is performed to combine selected features into a likelihood of good patient outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the CAD by leave-one- patient-out cross validation. A Positive Predicting Value of 1 was obtained at a sensitivity of 25% with an area under the ROC-curve of 0.86. The results show that the CAD is feasible to objectively predict patient outcome. The presented CAD could make an important contribution to acute ischemic stroke diagnosis and treatment.},

  abstract = {We present a method for automatic separation and classification of pulmonary arteries and veins in computed tomography. Our method takes advantage of local information to separate segmented vessels, and global information to perform the artery-vein classification. Given a vessel segmentation, a geometric graph is constructed that represents both the topology and the spatial distribution of the vessels. All nodes in the geometric graph where arteries and veins are potentially merged are identified based on graph pruning and individual branching patterns. At the identified nodes, the graph is split into subgraphs that each contain only arteries or veins. Based on the anatomical information that arteries and veins approach a common alveolar sag, an arterial subgraph is expected to be intertwined with a venous subgraph in the periphery of the lung. This relationship is quantified using periphery matching and is used to group subgraphs of the same artery-vein class. Artery-vein classification is performed on these grouped subgraphs based on the volumetric difference between arteries and veins. A quantitative evaluation was performed on 55 publicly available non-contrast {CT} scans. In all scans, two observers manually annotated randomly selected vessels as artery or vein. Our method was able to separate and classify arteries and veins with a median accuracy of 89\%, closely approximating the inter-observer agreement. All {CT} scans used in this study, including all results of our system and all manual annotations, are publicly available at http://arteryvein.grand-challenge.org.},

  title = {Sensitivity of airway wall thickness measurements: influence of small airways},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2015},
  url = {http://rsna2015.rsna.org/program/},
  abstract = {PURPOSE
                             Changes in the morphology of the airways contributes to lung function impairment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Measurements of airway morphology might be influenced by the quality of the airway segmentation. In this study we investigate the stability of a commonly used airway measurement (Pi10) from CT scans for varying segmentation depths of the airways.
                             METHOD AND MATERIALS
                             Inspiratory low-dose thoracic CT scans of 267 subjects, well distributed over GOLD stages, were selected for this study. Airways were automatically extracted by a state-of-the-art segmentation method and manually corrected to ensure a leakage free segmentation. Airway wall thickness quantification was performed in orthogonal cross-sections every 1mm throughout the entire airway tree using an intensity-integration technique which accounts for partial volume effects. Using regression on all cross-sectional measurements, airway morphology was expressed as the square root of wall area at airways with a perimeter of 10mm (Pi10). To determine the sensitivity of the Pi10 measurement to the length of the segmented airway tree, sensitivity analysis was performed on Pi10 by leaving-out wall measurements of the smallest airways and recalculating the Pi10. For each subject, Pi10 regression analysis was repeated excluding airways with a lumen perimeter below 6mm, 8mm or 10mm. The recalculated Pi10 measurements were compared to the baseline Pi10.
                             RESULTS
                             The segmented airway trees consisted for 55% of airways with lumen diameters below 10mm, 19% below 8mm, and 1% below 6mm.The average baseline Pi10 of all subjects was 2.43 +/- 0.56 (range [1.40, 4.36]), which corresponds to an average airway wall thickness (for an airway with a lumen perimeter of 10mm) of 0.52mm +/- 0.21mm. By excluding airways with a lumen perimeter below 6, 8 or 10mm from the regression analysis, absolute changes in Pi10 were 0.003 +/- 0.004 (0.11%), 0.035 +/- 0.023 (1.46%), and 0.107 +/- 0.087 (4.6%), respectively, corresponding to changes in airway wall thickness (at 10mm lumen perimeter) of 0.001, 0.013, and 0.039mm.
                             CONCLUSION
                             The commonly used Pi10 measurement to express airway morphology from a CT scan is insensitive to the exclusion of smaller airways in the computation.
                             CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION
                             When expressing airway morhplogy as Pi10, there is no need to (manually) adjust automatic airway segmentation methods to include smaller airways in order to obtain an accurate Pi10 measurement.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE
                             Automated classification of pulmonary arteries and veins in thoracic CT scans is an unsolved problem which is important for e.g. CAD of pulmonary embolisms and treatment planning. This study presents and validates a new anatomy-based method to automatically classify arteries and veins in non-contrast chest CT scans.
                             METHOD AND MATERIALS
                             A set of 55 full inspiration non-contrast low dose chest CT scans (16x0.75mm, 120-140kVp, 30mAs) with variable severity of emphysema and interstitial lung diseases, were taken from a lung cancer screening trial. In all state-of-the-art vessel segmentation algorithms, arteries and veins are attached at locations where they cross, since these algorithms are not designed to distinguish between bifurcating and crossing vessels. This method starts with automatic vessel segmentation, followed by pruning the vessel segmentation to detect locations that are inconsistent with the topology of a tree structure. By disconnecting the vessels at these locations, the vessel segmentation is separated into subtrees that fulfill a tree structure and are assumed to be of an arterial or venous label. Next, subtrees are grouped using anatomical knowledge that arterial and venous capillaries meet each other at the alveoli, which implies that the corresponding peripheral arteries and veins go towards similar regions. By analyzing the peripheral vessels in each subtree, subtrees of the same artery-vein label are grouped without knowing the actual label. To extract the final artery-vein labels of the grouped subtrees, classification is performed using the fact that veins have an overall larger volume compared to arteries. For quantitative evaluation, two human observers manually labeled a total of 2750 randomly selected arteries and veins from all 55 scans. The accuracy and Cohen's kappa between the observers and between the method and observers were used for evaluation.
                             RESULTS
                             Inter-observer Cohen's kappa was 0.84 with 93% accuracy. The proposed method achieved a mean accuracy of 88% and a Cohen's kappa of 0.76.
                             CONCLUSION
                             A new concept for artery-vein separation and classification was presented that uses anatomical information from peripheral arteries and veins. The performance of the presented method closely approximated the inter-observer agreement.
                             CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION
                             Automatic artery-vein classification is essential for investigating pulmonary hypertension, COPD and for improving CAD systems for pulmonary embolisms.},

  abstract = {{RATIONALE:}
                             To evaluate the relative contributions of quantitative {CT} ({QCT}) measures of emphysema, air trapping, and airway wall thickening and narrowing, to airflow obstruction in cigarette smokers with and without chronic obstructive lung disease ({COPD}).
                             {METHOD:}
                             2000 cigarette smokers participating in the {COPDG}ene study were evaluated, 818 subjects were excluded because of missing {QCT}. Thirona Lung Quantification software was used to extract {QCT} measures from inspiratory and expiratory {CT} scans for each subject, including emphysema (%{LAA}-950, defined as the percentage of low attenuation areas ({LAA}) below -950{HU} in inspiratory scans), gas trapping (%{LAA}-856, defined as the percentage of {LAA} below -856{HU} in expiration), and an index score for airway wall thickening and/or narrowing (Pi10, defined as the root of the wall area of a hypothetical airway of 10-mm internal perimeter). The evaluated spirometry measures included the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second ({FEV}1) and forced vital capacity ({FVC}), and the predicted percentage of {FEV}1 ({FEV}1%-predicted).
                             {QCT} measures were correlated to {FEV}1/{FVC} and {FEV}1%-predicted using Pearson correlation. In addition, multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the predicted value of the {QCT} measures on both {FEV}1/{FVC} and {FEV}1%-predicted. For these models, the spirometry measures were log10-transformed to ensure a distribution of residuals closer to normal.
                             {RESULTS:}
                             The 1183 subjects were divided over {GOLD} stagesChar16 0 to 4:478, 100, 279, 143 and 47. 136 subjects were unclassified by {GOLD}. %{LAA}-950, %{LAA}-856, and Pi10 correlated significantly with both {FEV}1/{FVC} (p<0.0001, r= -0.758, r=-0.829, and r=-0.423, respectively) and {FEV}1%-predicted (p<0.0001, r= -0.628, r=-0.728, and r=-0.547, respectively). In the regression model for {FEV}1/{FVC}, the combination of the three {QCT} measures accounted for 74.5% of the variation in {FEV}1/{FVC}, with a relative contribution of 68.7% for %{LAA}-856, 3.1% for Pi10, and 2.6% for %{LAA}-950. In the regression model for {FEV}1%-predicted, the combination of the three {QCT} measures accounted for 65.8% of the variation in {FEV}1%-predicted, with a relative contribution of 52.9% for %{LAA}-856, 11.6% for Pi10, and 1.3% for %{LAA}-950.
                             {CONCLUSION:}
                             Gas trapping and airway wall thickening and/or narrowing are the major contributors to airflow obstruction in cigarette smokers.},

  year = {2016},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: We investigated the relationship between airway dimensions and airflow obstruction and respiratory quality of life in current and former cigarette smokers. METHOD AND MATERIALS:
                             Cigarette smokers were studied that enrolled in the COPDGene study. Spirometry assessment included forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), % predicted FEV1 (FEV1%-p), % predicted FVC (FVC%-p), and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Respiratory quality of life was assessed by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score and 6 Minute Walking Distance (SMWD). Inspiratory CT was available to extract the airways, the amount of emphysema, and the total lung capacity (TLC). Lumen perimeters and airway wall areas were automatically extracted perpendicular to the airways. Linear regression was performed on these measurements to calculate an index score of airway wall thickness, expressed as the square root of wall area at airways with a perimeter of 10mm (Pi10). Emphysema was defined as the percentage of low-attenuation area below -950 HU (LAA%-950). Multiple linear regression was used to determine the predictive value of Pi10 and smoking status on airflow obstruction and respiratory quality of life. An interaction was included in the model to investigate if the effect of Pi10 differed by smoking status. All models were adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, pack years, bronchodilator responsiveness, TLC, and LAA%-950. RESULTS: 1544 cigarette smokers (894 former smokers) were included, with a mean age of 60.7 A-A?A 1/2  8.9 years and a mean Pi10 of 2.23 A-A?A 1/2  0.57mm. Pi10 was significantly associated with all airflow obstruction and respiratory quality of life measures (all p<0.001). The interaction between Pi10 and smoking status was significant for all measures except FVC%-p (p=0.30) and SGRQ score (p=0.064). This indicates that the effect of Pi10 on FEV1%-p, PEF, FEV1/FVC and SMWD was significantly reduced in current smokers compared to former smokers. CONCLUSION: Pi10 independently contributes to airflow obstruction and respiratory quality of life. This effect is stronger in former smokers as compared to current smokers. CLNICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: Pi10 is an independent marker for airflow obstruction and respiratory quality of life and may be more strongly associated with these outcomes in former smokers than current smokers.},

  title = {CT-based models for prediction of chronic obstructed pulmonary disease and smoking-related morbidity in cigarette smokers},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To predict COPD and smoking-related morbidity in cigarette smokers using quantitative CT (QCT) measures. METHOD AND MATERIALS: 1544 subjects were included from the COPDGene study. COPD was defined by a ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 sec. (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) < 0.7. Smoking-related morbidity was defined as FEV1/FVC < 0.70 with either a St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score >= 25 or an exacerbation frequency >= 2/year. On inspiratory CT, multiple cross-sectional lumen perimeters and airway wall areas were extracted from the airways. Using linear regression, airway wall thickness was defined as the square root of wall area of an airway with a perimeter of 10mm (Pi10). Total lung capacity (TLC) and emphysema were measured on inspiratory CT, where emphysema was defined as the % of low-attenuation areas (LAA%) < -950HU (LAA%-950). Air-trapping was defined on expiratory CT as LAA% < -856HU (LAA%-856). Six logistic regression models were fitted for both the prediction of COPD and smoking-related morbidity using a random subset of 761 subjects. Model 1 included only age, gender, BMI, pack years, smoking status, and TLC, while models 2 to 6 additionally included: LAA%-950 (model 2), LAA%-856 (model 3), Pi10 (model 4), LAA%-950 + Pi10 (model 5), and LAA%-950 + LAA%-856 + Pi10 (model 6). The models were validated on a separate set (810 subjects) using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). RESULTS:
                             The validation set consisted of 369 subjects with and 441 without COPD. QCT measures were independent predictors of COPD in all models (p<0.001), with AUC values for models 1 to 6 of 0.77, 0.85, 0.90, 0.87, 0.91, and 0.93, respectively. The validation set consisted of 216 subject with and 594 without smoking-related morbidity. QCT measures were independent predictors of smoking-related morbidity in all models (p<0.001, except for LAA%-950 in model 5), with AUC values for models 1 to 6 of 0.72, 0.83, 0.87, 0.83, 0.88, and 0.89, respectively. CONCLUSION: LAA%-950, LAA%-856, and Pi10 are independent predictors of COPD and smoking-related morbidity. The model including only inspiratory QCT predictors has similar predictive value to the model that also includes expiratory air-trapping. CLNICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: Since LAA%-950 and Pi10 can be readily extracted from inspiratory images, these measures may be useful to predict smoking related morbidity in lung cancer screening.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel method to improve airway segmentation in thoracic computed tomography (CT) by detecting and removing leaks. Leak detection is formulated as a classification problem, in which a convolutional network (ConvNet) is trained in a supervised fashion to perform the classification task. In order to increase the segmented airway tree length, we take advantage of the fact that multiple segmentations can be extracted from a given airway segmentation algorithm by varying the parameters that influence the tree length and the amount of leaks. We propose a strategy in which the combination of these segmentations after removing leaks can increase the airway tree length while limiting the amount of leaks. This strategy therefore largely circumvents the need for parameter fine-tuning of a given airway segmentation algorithm.

                             The ConvNet was trained and evaluated using a subset of inspiratory thoracic CT scans taken from the COPDGene study. Our method was validated on a separate independent set of the EXACT?09 challenge. We show that our method significantly improves the quality of a given leaky airway segmentation, achieving a higher sensitivity at a low false-positive rate compared to all the state-of-the-art methods that entered in EXACT09, and approaching the performance of the combination of all of them.},

  abstract = {Subsolid pulmonary nodules are commonly encountered in lung cancer screening and clinical routine. Compared to other nodule types, subsolid nodules are associated with a higher malignancy probability for which the size and mass of the nodule and solid core are important indicators. However, reliably measuring these characteristics on computed tomography (CT) can be hampered by the presence of vessels encompassed by the nodule, since vessels have similar CT attenuation as solid cores. This can affect treatment decisions and patient management. We present a method based on voxel classification to automatically identify vessels and solid cores in given subsolid nodules on CT. Three experts validated our method on 170 screen-detected subsolid nodules from the Multicentric Italian Lung Disease trial. The agreement between the proposed method and the observers was substantial for vessel detection and moderate for solid core detection, which was similar to the inter-observer agreement. We found a relatively high variability in the inter-observer agreement and low method-observer agreements for delineating the borders of vessels and solid cores, illustrating the difficulty of this task. However, 92.4% of the proposed vessel and 80.6% of the proposed solid core segmentations were labeled as usable in clinical practice by the majority of experts.},

  abstract = {Airway wall thickening in cigarette smokers is thought to be a result of inflammatory changes and airway remodeling. This study investigates if CT-derived airway wall thickening associates to disease severity in smokers with and without COPD and if airway wall thickening is reversible by smoking cessation. We examined 2000 smokers and 46 never-smokers who returned for a 5-year follow-up visit in the COPDGene-study. Multivariable regression analyses were performed at visit 1 to associate airway wall thickness (expressed as Pi10) with percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1%-predicted), 6-min walking distance (6MWD), and St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Longitudinal analyses were performed to assess the effect of smoking cessation on Pi10 using linear mixed models. A higher Pi10 was significantly associated with worse FEV1%-predicted, 6MWD, and SGRQ in all GOLD-stages. Longitudinal analyses showed that subjects that quit smoking significantly decreased in Pi10 (DPi10 = -0.18 mm, p < 0.001). Subjects that started smoking had a significant increase in Pi10 (DPi10 = 0.14 mm, p < 0.001). Pi10 is a clinically relevant biomarker of smoking-related airway injury in smokers with and without COPD. The change in Pi10 with change in smoking status suggests that it can quantify a reversible component of smoking-related airway inflammation.},

The procedural risks of renal artery dilatation are compounded by the danger of occlusion of one of the branch arteries during maneuvers to dilate the other. Long-term results of surgical vascular reconstruction at a renal artery bifurcation are not satisfactory. Untreated, these stenoses lead to intractable hypertension and impairment or loss of renal function. We present a patient with hypertension and impaired function of the right kidney on account of a renal arterial bifurcation stenosis. Using a bilateral transfemoral arterial approach 2 balloon catheters were simultaneously placed into the origins of the renal artery branches and both arteries were successfully dilated by the kissing balloons technique. This method provides an elegant alternative to difficult surgery to save an endangered kidney.},

Our proposed design cascading two models working on voxel- and object-level allowed for a significant reduction of false positive findings by 85% when compared with the raw neural network output. In comparison with the human performance, our approach achieves a similar segmentation quality for detected tumors (mean Dice 0.69 vs. 0.72), but is inferior in the detection performance (recall 63% vs. 92%).

For testing, patient's precise reference segmentations that fulfill the quality requirements for liver surgery were manually created. One radiologist and two radiology residents were asked to provide manual routine segmentations. We used our automatic segmentation method Liver-Net to produce liver masks for the test cases and asked a radiologist assistant and one further resident to correct the automatic results. All observers were asked to measure their interaction time. Both manual routine and corrected segmentations were compared with the reference annotations. The manual routine segmentations achieved a mean Dice index of 0.95 and a mean relative error (RVE) of 4.7%. The quality of liver masks produced by the Liver-Net was on average 0.95 Dice and 4.5% RVE. Liver masks resulting from manual corrections of automatically generated segmentations compared to routine results led to a significantly lower inter-observer variability (mean per case absolute RVE difference across observers 0.69%) when compared to manual routine ones (2.75%). The mean interaction time was 2 min for manual corrections and 10 min for manual routine segmentations. The quality of automatic liver segmentations is on par with those from manual routines. Using automatic liver masks in the clinical workflow could lead to a reduction of segmentation time and a more consistent liver volume estimation across different observers.},

  abstract = {{T}his study investigated the reproducibility of {HRCT} densitometric measures of emphysema in patients scanned twice one week apart. 24 emphysema patients from a multicenter study were scanned at full inspiration {(TLC)} and expiration {(RV)}, then again a week later for four scans total. Scans for each patient used the same scanner and protocol, except for tube current in three patients. Lung segmentation with gross airway removal was performed on the scans. Volume, weight, mean lung density {(MLD)}, relative area under -950{HU} ({RA}-950), and 15th percentile ({PD}-15) were calculated for {TLC}, and volume and an airtrapping mask ({RA}-air) between -950 and -850{HU} for {RV}. For each measure, absolute differences were computed for each scan pair, and linear regression was performed against volume difference in a subgroup with volume difference <500mL. Two {TLC} scan pairs were excluded due to segmentation failure. The mean lung volumes were 5802 +/- 1420m{L} for {TLC}, 3878 +/- 1077m{L} for {RV}. The mean absolute differences were 169m{L} for {TLC} volume, 316mL for {RV} volume, 14.5g for weight, 5.0{HU} for {MLD}, 0.66p.p. for {RA}-950, 2.4{HU} for {PD}-15, and 3.1p.p. for {RA}-air. The <500m{L} subgroup had 20 scan pairs for {TLC} and {RV}. The {R}2 values were 0.8 for weight, 0.60 for {MLD}, 0.29 for {RA}-950, 0.31 for {PD}-15, and 0.64 for {RA}-air. Our results indicate that considerable variability exists in densitometric measures over one week that cannot be attributed to breathhold or physiology. This has implications for clinical trials relying on these measures to assess emphysema treatment efficacy.},

  abstract = {{RATIONALE:} {T}o examine the reproducibility of {H}igh-resolution {C}omputed {T}omography ({HRCT}) densitometric measures of emphysema in patients scanned twice one week apart, and to assess the effects of breathhold (measured by {CT} lung volume) and scanner calibration (measured by separate phantom scans) on reproducibility. {METHODS:} {CT} scans were obtained from our anonymized research database for 27 emphysema patients scanned at full inspiration on two separate visits (median 7 days, standard deviation 2.4 days). Patients were instructed on proper breathholding before scanning to maximize breathhold reproducibility. For each patient, the same scanner and protocol was used for both visits. An air and water phantom was scanned on the same scanner within 24 hours of each patient. For each scan, lung segmentation was performed including removal of gross airway structure. Lung volume ({V}), relative area below -950{HU} ({RA}950) and 15th percentile density ({PD}15) were computed, and mean {H}ounsfield {U}nit ({HU}) of water ({P}water) and air ({P}air) were 15 obtained from the corresponding phantom scan. Difference between visits was computed for each quantity ({?V}, {?RA}950, {?PD}15, {?P}water,{ ?P}air), and {B}land-{A}ltman analysis was used to assess reproducibility for {V}, {RA}950, and {PD}15. This analysis was repeated for a subgroup with {|?V|}<250mL (representing excellent breathhold reproducibility). Next, linear regression was performed for {?RA}950 versus {?V}, {?P} water, and {?P}air, and also for {?PD}15 versus {?V}, {?P}water, and {?P}air . {RESULTS:} {T}able 1 summarizes the quantities in this study. Table 2 displays the results of {B}land-{A}ltman analysis. {R}eproducibility of breathhold and {RA}950 were high, with limits of agreement within 500mL and 1.5 percentage points (p.p.), respectively. {R}eproducibility for {PD}15 was poorer overall but improved noticeably in the <250mL subgroup, from 7 to 3{HU}. This effect was not observed for {RA}950. For {?RA}950, linear regression revealed an {R^2} of 0.43, 0.00, and 0.00 versus {?V}, {?P}water , and {?P}air , respectively. {?PD}15 exhibited an {R^2} of 0.74, 0.03, and 0.01 versus ?V, {?P}water, and {?P}air. Linear regression against {?V} is displayed in {F}igures 1 and 2. {CONCLUSION:} This study consists of a population of patients with high breathhold reproducibility (within 500m{L}) imaged on scanners with good calibration. Under these conditions, our data suggests that the precision of {RA}950 is within 1.5p.p. {PD}15 demonstrated greater sensitivity to breathhold, and a precision of 3{HU} was achieved by requiring breathhold reproducibility of 250m{L}. Our analysis revealed no relationship between scanner calibration and density measures, although this finding may change for a wider range of calibrations.},

Methods. {HRCT} was performed on 45 subjects at inspiration on two visits with a seven-day interval. {CT} lung volume, relative area below {-950HU} ({RA950}-raw), and 15th percentile density ({PD}15-raw) were computed. Volume correction was used to obtain {RA}950-adj and {PD}15-adj. Reproducibilities between visits were assessed using concordance correlation coefficient ({CCC}) and repeatability coefficient ({RC}). Reproducibilities were compared between raw and adjusted measures. Correlations were computed for density differences versus volume difference. Subgroup analysis was performed using a 0.25L volume difference threshold. Results. High {CCC} were observed for all measures in full group ({CCC}>0.97). Reproducibilities of volume ({RC}=0.67L), {RA}950-raw ({RC}=2.3%), and {PD}15-raw ({RC}=10.6{HU}) were observed. Volume correction significantly improved {PD}15 ({RC}=3.6{HU}) but not {RA}950 ({RC}=1.7%). {RA}950-raw and {PD}15-raw had significantly better {RC} in <0.25{L} subgroup than =0.25{L}.

Good breathhold and {RA}950 reproducibilities were achieved. {PD}15 was less reproducible but improved with volume correction or superior breathhold reproduction.

  abstract = {Purpose: Current recommendations propose a three month follow-up CT scan to differentiate between persistent and transient subsolid lesions leading to a substantial number of short term follow-ups. Purpose of the study was to look for morphological features to differentiate persistent from transient lesions. Methods and Materials: Transient and persistent subsolid nodules were randomly selected from the NELSON and DLCST screening trial. An experienced chest radiologist assessed a number of predefined morphological features. Likelihood of persistence was assessed using a continuous scale between 0-1 00. MANOVA statistics were used to assess the discriminating power of morphological features (p<0.05 was considered significant), ROC analysis was applied to assess ability to differentiate persistent from transient lesions. Results: A total of 1 22 nodules were assessed (median 9.7mm). Size distribution was equivalent for the two groups. The ROC area under the curve (AUC) for differentiating was 0.68 for all lesions and 0.82 for lesions >1 0mm. MANOVA revealed no significant discriminative features for all lesions, but yielded significance (p=0.02) for lesions >5mm. Multiplicity (p=0.046) and margin characteristics (p=0.006) had significant discriminative power. Demarcation by interlobular septum was predictive for transient nodules (74% vs. 26%) while spiculation was predictive for persistence (100% vs. 0%). Conclusion: There are morphological features with significant predictive power to differentiate persistent from transient subsolid nodules. They may be used in risk stratification models for subsolid nodules and serve as input for computerized classification systems.},

  abstract = {Purpose To evaluate the added value of Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) assessment category 4X over categories 3, 4A, and 4B for differentiating between benign and malignant subsolid nodules (SSNs). Materials and Methods SSNs on all baseline computed tomographic (CT) scans from the National Lung Cancer Trial that would have been classified as Lung-RADS category 3 or higher were identified, resulting in 374 SSNs for analysis. An experienced screening radiologist volumetrically segmented all solid cores and located all malignant SSNs visible on baseline scans. Six experienced chest radiologists independently determined which nodules to upgrade to category 4X, a recently introduced category for lesions that demonstrate additional features or imaging findings that increase the suspicion of malignancy. Malignancy rates of purely size-based categories and category 4X were compared. Furthermore, the false-positive rates of category 4X lesions were calculated and observer variability was assessed by using Fleiss kappa statistics. Results The observers upgraded 15%-24% of the SSNs to category 4X. The malignancy rate for 4X nodules varied from 46% to 57% per observer and was substantially higher than the malignancy rates of categories 3, 4A, and 4B SSNs without observer intervention (9%, 19%, and 23%, respectively). On average, the false-positive rate for category 4X nodules was 7% for category 3 SSNs, 7% for category 4A SSNs, and 19% for category 4B SSNs. Of the falsely upgraded benign lesions, on average 27% were transient. The agreement among the observers was moderate, with an average kappa value of 0.535 (95% confidence interval: 0.509, 0.561). Conclusion The inclusion of a 4X assessment category for lesions suspicious for malignancy in a nodule management tool is of added value and results in high malignancy rates in the hands of experienced radiologists. Proof of the transient character of category 4X lesions at short-term follow-up could avoid unnecessary invasive management.},

The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare malignancy rates for Lung-RADS 2 and 4B subsolid nodules (SSNs) on a nodule base. We identified all baseline SSNs eligible for Lung-RADS 2 and 4B in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) database. Solid cores and nodule locations were annotated using in-house software. Malignant SSNs were identified by an experienced radiologist using NLST information. Malignancy rates and percentages of persistence were calculated. Of the Lung-RADS 2SSNs, 94.3% (1790/1897) could be located on chest CTs. Likewise, 95.1% (331/348) of part-solid nodules larger or equal to 6 mm in diameter could be located. Of these, 120 had a solid core larger or equal to 8 mm, corresponding to category 4B. Category 2 SSNs showed a malignancy rate of 2.5%, exceeding slightly the proposed rate of <1%. Category 4B SSNs showed a malignancy rate of 23.9%. In both categories one third of benign lesions were transient. Malignancy probabilities for Lung-RADS 2 and 4B generally match malignancy rates in SSNs. An option to include also category 2 SSNs for upgrade to 4X designed for suspicious nodules might be useful in the future. Integration of short-term follow-up to confirm persistence would prevent unnecessary invasive work-up in 4B SSNs. Malignancy probabilities for Lung-RADS 2/4B generally match malignancy risks in SSNs. Transient rate between low-risk Lung-RADS 2 and high-risk 4B lesions were similar. Upgrade of highly suspicious Lung-RADS 2 SSNs to Lung-RADS 4X might be useful. Up to one third of the benign high-risk Lung-RADS 4B lesions were transient. Short-term follow-up confirming persistence would avoid unnecessary invasive work-up of 4B lesions.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate whether, and to which extent, experienced radiologists are
                             able to visually correctly differentiate transient from persistent subsolid
                             nodules from a single CT examination alone and to determine CT morphological
                             features to make this differentiation.
                             MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected 86 transient and 135 persistent subsolid
                             nodules from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) database. Four experienced
                             radiologists visually assessed a predefined list of morphological features and
                             gave a final judgment on a continuous scale (0-100). To assess observer
                             performance, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was
                             calculated. Statistical differences of morphological features between transient
                             and persistent lesions were calculated using Chi-square. Inter-observer agreement
                             of morphological features was evaluated by percentage agreement.
                             RESULTS: Forty-nine lesions were excluded by at least 2 observers, leaving 172
                             lesions for analysis. On average observers were able to differentiate transient
                             from persistent subsolid nodules >= 10 mm with an area under the curve of 0.75
                             (95% CI 0.67-0.82). Nodule type, lesion margin, presence of a well-defined
                             border, and pleural retraction showed significant differences between transient
                             and persistent lesions in two observers. Average pair-wise percentage agreement
                             for these features was 81%, 64%, 47% and 89% respectively. Agreement for other
                             morphological features varied from 53% to 95%.
                             CONCLUSION: The visual capacity of experienced radiologists to differentiate
                             persistent and transient subsolid nodules is moderate in subsolid nodules larger
                             than 10 mm. Performance of the visual assessment of CT morphology alone is not
                             sufficient to generally abandon a short-term follow-up for subsolid nodules.},

In this thesis we address a few issues with respect to human and computer-enhanced characterization and risk prediction of subsolid nodules that give more insight in optimizing and ideally individualizing management of this subset of lesions. Since subsolid nodules are seen less frequent than solid nodules, we took the advantage of the largest publicly available screening data base of the NLST for our studies.},

  abstract = {To assess the performance of the Brock malignancy risk model for pulmonary nodules detected in routine clinical setting. In two academic centres in the Netherlands, we established a list of patients aged >=40 years who received a chest CT scan between 2004 and 2012, resulting in 16 850 and 23 454 eligible subjects. Subsequent diagnosis of lung cancer until the end of 2014 was established through linking with the National Cancer Registry. A nested case-control study was performed (ratio 1:3). Two observers used semiautomated software to annotate the nodules. The Brock model was separately validated on each data set using ROC analysis and compared with a solely size-based model. After the annotation process the final analysis included 177 malignant and 695 benign nodules for centre A, and 264 malignant and 710 benign nodules for centre B. The full Brock model resulted in areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.90 and 0.91, while the size-only model yielded significantly lower AUCs of 0.88 and 0.87, respectively (p<0.001). At 10% malignancy risk, the threshold suggested by the British Thoracic Society, sensitivity of the full model was 75% and 81%, specificity was 85% and 84%, positive predictive values were 14% and 10% at negative predictive value (NPV) of 99%. The optimal threshold was 6% for centre A and 8% for centre B, with NPVs >99%. The Brock model shows high predictive discrimination of potentially malignant and benign nodules when validated in an unselected, heterogeneous clinical population. The high NPV may be used to decrease the number of nodule follow-up examinations.},

TM is a common congenital pediatric anomaly, but itA-A?A 1/2 s often not recognized due to its unspecific clinical presentation. The aims of our study are: 1) to develop cine-MRI sequences to visualize central airways in static and dynamic conditions in patients that were able to follow specific breathing manoeuvres;2) to develop post-processing tools for image analysis. Methods and Materials: To date 10 subjects (7 males; 2 adults) were enrolled in the pilot study: mean age 15, (range 6 to 30yrs). Volunteers were trained to perform spirometry controlled breathing maneuvers (peak flow and coughing) using a MRI compatible spirometer. A-A?A 1/2 Static?? 13-second breath-hold scans covering the entire thoracic region were acquired at end-inspiration and end-expiration using a 3D GRE with TR/TE=1.2/0.5 ms, a = 2A-A?A 1/2 , sagittal isotropic volume (2.8) x 3mm3 voxels. A-A?A 1/2 Dynamic?? scans were performed with the same parameters but covering only the central thorax (1/3 volume), temporal resolution was 500 ms per volume using the TRICKS. In-house developed software for segmentation and analysis was used. Results: All subjects managed to follow the required breathing maneuvers. Images of central airways during static and dynamic conditions were acquired and could be analyzed. Three out of the 8 children had a TM just above the carina during forced expiration, confirmed by bronchoscopy. Conclusion: This pilot study shows that Dynamic-MRI is feasible in pediatric population and allows avoiding radiation exposure and bronchoscopy for the evaluation of central airway dimensions.},

  abstract = {Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is defined as an excessive collapse of the intrathoracic trachea. Bronchoscopy is the gold standard to diagnose TBM, but bronchoscopy has major disadvantages, such as general anaesthesia. Cine-CT is a non-invasive alternative to diagnose TBM, but its use in children is restricted by ionizing radiation. Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility of spirometer-controlled cine-MRI as alternative to cine-CT in a retrospective study. 12 children (mean 12 years, range 7AC/a,!aEURoe17), suspected to have TBM, underwent cine-MRI. Static scans were acquired at end-inspiration and expiration covering the thorax using a 3D SPGR sequence. 3D-Dynamic-scans were performed covering only the central airways. TBM was defined as a decrease of the trachea or bronchi diameter greater than 50% at end-expiration in the static and dynamic scans. The success rate of the cine-MRI protocol was 92%. Cine-MRI was compared with bronchoscopy or chest-CT in 7 subjects. TBM was diagnosed by cine-MRI in 7 out of 12 children (58%) and was confirmed by bronchoscopy or CT. In 4 patients, cine-MRI demonstrated tracheal narrowing that was not present in the static scans. Spirometer-controlled cineAC/a,!aEURoeMRI is a promising technique to assess TBM in children and has the potential to replace bronchoscopy.},

  abstract = {Accurate detection of in-vivo vulnerable plaque in coronary arteries is still an open problem. Recent studies show that it is highly related to tissue structure and composition. Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) is a powerful imaging technique that gives a detailed cross-sectional image of the vessel, allowing to explore arteries morphology. IVUS data validation is usually performed by comparing post-mortem (invitro) IVUS data and corresponding histological analysis of the tissue. The main drawback of this method is the few number of available case studies and validated data due to the complex procedure of histological analysis of the tissue. On the other hand, IVUS data from in-vivo cases is easy to obtain but it can not be histologically validated. In this work, we propose to enhance the in-vitro training data set by selectively including examples from in-vivo plaques. For this purpose, a Sequential Floating Forward Selection method is reformulated in the context of plaque characterization. The enhanced classifier performance is validated on in-vitro data set, yielding an overall accuracy of 91.59% in discriminating among fibrotic, lipidic and calcified plaques, while reducing the gap between in-vivo and in-vitro data analysis. Experimental results suggest that the obtained classifier could be properly applied on in-vivo plaque characterization and also demonstrate that the common hypothesis of assuming the difference between in-vivo and in-vitro as negligible is incorrect.},

  abstract = {In this thesis we tackle the problem of automatic characterization of human coronary vessel in Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) image modality. The basis for the whole characterization process is machine learning applied to multiclass problems. In all the presented approaches, the Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) framework is used as central element for the design of multi-class classi ers. Two main topics are tackled in this thesis. First, the automatic detection of the vessel borders is presented. For this purpose, a novel context-aware classi er for multi-class classi cation of the vessel morphology is presented, namely ECOCDRF. Based on ECOC-DRF, the lumen border and the media-adventitia border in IVUS are robustly detected by means of a novel holistic approach, achieving an error comparable with inter-observer variability and with state of the art methods. The two vessel borders de ne the atheroma area of the vessel. In this area, tissue characterization is required. For this purpose, we present a framework for automatic plaque characterization by processing both texture in IVUS images and spectral information in raw Radio Frequency data. Furthermore, a novel method for fusing in-vivo and in-vitro IVUS data for plaque characterization is presented, namely pSFFS. The method demonstrates to e ectively fuse data generating a classi er that improves the tissue characterization in both in-vitro and in-vivo datasets. A novel method for automatic video summarization in IVUS sequences is also presented. The method aims to detect the key frames of the sequence, i.e., the frames representative of morphological changes. This novel method represents the basis for video summarization in IVUS as well as the markers for the partition of the vessel into morphological and clinically interesting events. Finally, multi-class learning based on ECOC is applied to lung tissue characterization in Computed Tomography. The novel proposed approach, based on supervised and unsupervised learning, achieves accurate tissue classi cation on a large and heterogeneous dataset.},

  abstract = {Title. Automatic Classification of Perifissural Pulmonary Nodules in Thoracic CT Images. Purpose. Up to one third of pulmonary nodules detected in heavy smokers are perifissural nodules (PFNs) that do not require follow-up. An automatic method is presented to distinguish PFNs from solid nodules. Materials and Methods. We used all baseline scans with a pulmonary nodule from one of the sites of the NELSON trial. All participants were either current or former heavy smokers (age between 50 and 75 years), and underwent low-dose CT (Mx8000 IDT 16; Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, Ohio). Human experts annotated non-calcified solid nodules in 1,729 scans, and classified these as PFN (788) and non-PFN (3,038). We formulated PFN classification as a machine learning problem where a classifier is trained to automatically label nodules as PFN or non-PFN. Given the characteristic triangular-like shape of PFNs, a novel descriptor encoding information on nodule morphology was designed. The descriptor is based on frequency analysis of intensity profiles sampled in the CT image. Given a detected nodule, spherical surfaces up to a maximum radius R are considered, centered on the center of mass of the nodule. For each sphere, the image intensity is sampled along C circular profiles on the surface of each sphere at constant angular distance. The profiles are interpreted as a periodic signal, and their spectrum is obtained using a Fast Fourier Transform. Each spectrum encodes information on nodule morphology through a set of characteristic frequencies. A set of K spectral signatures is computed applying K-means on the collected set of spectra. A compact nodule descriptor is obtained as the histogram of spectral signatures along the spheres. A Random Forests classifier with 100 trees was used for supervised learning. A 10-folds cross-validation scheme was applied to evaluate the method on the 3,826 nodules, using C=128, K=100. Since the range of PFNs diameters is 2.8-10.6 mm, we used R = 7.5 mm. Results. We obtained a value of area under the ROC curve of 0.85, with an optimal operating point of 77% sensitivity and 79% specificity. Misclassified PFNs were often close to the pleura or to other vascular structures. Conclusion. Classification of pulmonary nodules as PFN is feasible and has the potential to be used as an automatic tool in CAD. Clinical Relevance. PFNs rarely turn out to be malignant, even though their growth rate is similar to that of malignant nodules. Automatic recognition of PFNs could reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up CT exams.},

  abstract = {We present a novel descriptor for the characterization of pulmonary nodules in computed tomography (CT) images. The descriptor encodes information on nodule morphology and has scale-invariant and rotation-invariant properties. Information on nodule morphology is captured by sampling intensity profiles along circular patterns on spherical surfaces centered on the nodule, in a multi-scale fashion. Each intensity profile is interpreted as a periodic signal, where the Fourier transform is applied, obtaining a spectrum. A library of spectra is created and labeled via unsupervised clustering, obtaining a Bag-of- Frequencies, which is used to assign each spectra a label. The descriptor is obtained as the histogram of labels along all the spheres. Additional contributions are a technique to estimate the nodule size, based on the sampling strategy, as well as a technique to choose the most informative plane to cut a 2-D view of the nodule in the 3-D image. We evaluate the descriptor on several nodule morphology classification problems, namely discrimination of nodules versus vascular structures and characterization of spiculation. We validate the descriptor on data from European screening trials NELSON and DLCST and we compare it with state-of-the-art approaches for 3-D shape description in medical imaging and computer vision, namely SPHARM and 3-D SIFT, outperforming them in all the considered experiments.},

  abstract = {We present a fully automatic method for the assessment of spiculation of pulmonary nodules in low-dose Computed Tomography (CT) images. Spiculation is considered as one of the indicators of nodule malignancy and an important feature to assess in order to decide on a patient-tailored follow-up procedure. For this reason, lung cancer screening scenario would benefit from the presence of a fully automatic system for the assessment of spiculation. The presented framework relies on the fact that spiculated nodules mainly differ from non-spiculated ones in their morphology. In order to discriminate the two categories, information on morphology is captured by sampling intensity profiles along circular patterns on spherical surfaces centered on the nodule, in a multi-scale fashion. Each intensity profile is interpreted as a periodic signal, where the Fourier transform is applied, obtaining a spectrum. A library of spectra is created by clustering data via unsupervised learning. The centroids of the clusters are used to label back each spectrum in the sampling pattern. A compact descriptor encoding the nodule morphology is obtained as the histogram of labels along all the spherical surfaces and used to classify spiculated nodules via supervised learning. We tested our approach on a set of nodules from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST) dataset. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms other 3-D descriptors of morphology in the automatic assessment of spiculation.},

The identification of struts location and the definition of the stent shape is relevant for PCI planning and for patient follow-up. The authors present a fully automatic framework for computer-aided detection (CAD) of intracoronary stents in intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) image sequences. The CAD system is able to detect stent struts and estimate the stent shape. The proposed CAD uses machine learning to provide a comprehensive interpretation of the local structure of the vessel by means of semantic classification. The output of the classification stage is then used to detect struts and to estimate the stent shape. The proposed approach is validated using a multicentric data-set of 1,015 images from 107 IVUS sequences containing both metallic and bioabsorbable stents. The method was able to detect struts in both metallic stents with an overall F-measure of 77.7% and a mean distance of 0.15 mm from manually annotated struts, and in bioabsorbable stents with an overall F-measure of 77.4% and a mean distance of 0.09 mm from manually annotated struts. The results are close to the interobserver variability and suggest that the system has the potential of being used as a method for aiding percutaneous interventions.},

  abstract = {The introduction of lung cancer screening programs will produce an unprecedented amount of chest CT scans in the near future, which radiologists will have to read in order to decide on a patient follow-up strategy. According to the current guidelines, the workup of screen-detected nodules strongly relies on nodule size and nodule type. In this paper, we present a deep learning system based on multi-stream multi-scale convolutional networks, which automatically classifies all nodule types relevant for nodule workup. The system processes raw CT data containing a nodule without the need for any additional information such as nodule segmentation or nodule size and learns a representation of 3D data by analyzing an arbitrary number of 2D views of a given nodule. The deep learning system was trained with data from the Italian MILD screening trial and validated on an independent set of data from the Danish DLCST screening trial. We analyze the advantage of processing nodules at multiple scales with a multi-stream convolutional network architecture, and we show that the proposed deep learning system achieves performance at classifying nodule type that surpasses the one of classical machine learning approaches and is within the inter-observer variability among four experienced human observers.},

  title = {Is Late Phase Information Necessary for Dynamic Evaluation of Breast Cancer?},
  booktitle = ECR,
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Purpose: Novel breast MRI protocols evaluate early contrast uptake of lesions, using a short acquisition time and high tempor al resolution (tRes). However, these acquisitions do not provide information about late phase enhancement (curve- type). In this study we investigated whether adding late phase information to early contrast uptake dynamics improves the differentiation between benign and malignant lesions as measured with a computer aided diagnosis (CADx) system. Methods and Materials: 106 malignant and 44 benign lesions were evaluated, which were imaged with a 4.3 seconds tRes sequence for the initial 100 seconds and a high spatial resolution sequence for the subsequent 510 seconds. The locations of the lesions were marked manually. The CAD system automatically segmented the lesions and extracted six features that describe the early contrast uptake. These features were used in a random forest classifier for malignant/benign classification. In the second step, washout rate (WR) of the lesions obtained from the late phase acquisitions were added to these features and classification was repeated. The classification accuracies of both methods were compared using ROC analysis. Results: The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.816 with high tRes early contrast uptake dynamics features alone. Adding the WR feature slightly increased the AUC value to 0.824, where the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Addition of late phase information on top of high tRes early uptake dynamics did not increase the diagnostic performance significantly. This result supports the feasibility of shorter MRI protocols for classification of breast lesions.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate early-phase contrast enhancement biomarkers computed by a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system to distinguish between different molecular subtypes of invasive breast lesions, imaged with a high spatiotemporal resolution view-sharing Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DCE)-MRI protocol. METHOD AND MATERIALS: We collected images of 164 (21 basal, 24 HER2+ and 119 ER/PR+) invasive breast cancer lesions from 145 patients. Our MRI protocol provided 20 images of contrast-agent uptake each 4.3 seconds apart. A CADx system was developed to characterize the lesions based on early-phase contrast uptake dynamics. This CADx system was composed of four main steps. First, the lesion was segmented using manually placed seed points. Second, the aorta was automatically detected in the MR volume and initial time of enhancement in the aorta was computed. Third, for each voxel, contrast uptake data was fit to an exponential model and six dynamic features were computed based on this curve. These features were computed with respect to the first time point where the aorta starts to enhance. For each feature, we computed mean and standard deviation values in the entire segmented lesion. Additionally these features were computed in an automatically selected small hot-spot of the lesion (without standard deviation). This resulted in a total of 18 features characterizing the early phase dynamics. Finally, random-forests classifiers were trained and tested in a leave-one-out fashion in the study dataset in 3 different ways, to distinguish: (1) basal-type lesions from others, (2) HER2+ lesions from others and (3) ER/PR+ lesions from other type lesions. We evaluated performance for each classification using ROC analysis. We computed 5 percent confidence intervals for area under curve (AUC) values using a bootstrapping method. RESULTS: The AUC values for classification of basal-type/others, HER2+/others and ER/PR+/others were 0.68 (0.58-0.77), 0.62 (0.52-0.73) and 0.58 (0.49-0.68), respectively. CONCLUSION: A CADx system was used to distinguish between three different molecular subtypes of invasive breast lesions, where the highest performance was found in classification of basal type lesions from others. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: Early phase contrast enhancement dynamics measured with DCE-MRI of the breast can be used to give an indication of molecular subtype for invasive breast cancer lesions. CADx systems can be used for this purpose.},

  abstract = {With novel MRI sequences, high spatiotemporal resolution has become available in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of the breast. Since benign structures in the breast can show enhancement similar to malignancies in DCE-MRI, characterization of detected lesions is an important problem. The purpose of this study is to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system for characterization of breast lesions imaged with high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI.The developed CADx system is composed of four main parts: semiautomated lesion segmentation, automated computation of morphological and dynamic features, aorta detection, and classification between benign and malignant categories. Lesion segmentation is performed by using a "multiseed smart opening" algorithm. Five morphological features were computed based on the segmentation of the lesion. For each voxel, contrast enhancement curve was fitted to an exponential model and dynamic features were computed based on this fitted curve. Average and standard deviations of the dynamic features were computed over the entire segmented area, in addition to the average value in an automatically selected smaller "most suspicious region." To compute the dynamic features for an enhancement curve, information of aortic enhancement is also needed. To keep the system fully automated, the authors developed a component which automatically detects the aorta and computes the aortic enhancement time. The authors used random forests algorithm to classify benign lesions from malignant. The authors evaluated this system in a dataset of breast MRI scans of 325 patients with 223 malignant and 172 benign lesions and compared its performance to an existing approach. The authors also evaluated the classification performances for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) lesions separately. The classification performances were measured by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis in a leave-one-out cross validation scheme.The area under the ROC curve (AUC) obtained by the proposed CADx system was 0.8543, which was significantly higher (p = 0.007) than the performance obtained by the previous CADx system (0.8172) on the same dataset. The AUC values for DCIS, IDC, and ILC lesions were 0.7924, 0.8688, and 0.8650, respectively.The authors developed a CADx system for high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI of the breast. This system outperforms a previously proposed system in classifying benign and malignant lesions, while it requires less user interactions.},

  abstract = {Automated segmentation of breast and fibroglandular tissue (FGT) is required for various computer-aided applications of breast MRI. Traditional image analysis and computer vision techniques, such atlas, template matching, or, edge and surface detection, have been applied to solve this task. However, applicability of these methods is usually limited by the characteristics of the images used in the study datasets, while breast MRI varies with respect to the different MRI protocols used, in addition to the variability in breast shapes. All this variability, in addition to various MRI artifacts, makes it a challenging task to develop a robust breast and FGT segmentation method using traditional approaches. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the use of a deep-learning approach known as "U-net." We used a dataset of 66 breast MRI's randomly selected from our scientific archive, which includes five different MRI acquisition protocols and breasts from four breast density categories in a balanced distribution. To prepare reference segmentations, we manually segmented breast and FGT for all images using an in-house developed workstation. We experimented with the application of U-net in two different ways for breast and FGT segmentation. In the first method, following the same pipeline used in traditional approaches, we trained two consecutive (2C) U-nets: first for segmenting the breast in the whole MRI volume and the second for segmenting FGT inside the segmented breast. In the second method, we used a single 3-class (3C) U-net, which performs both tasks simultaneously by segmenting the volume into three regions: nonbreast, fat inside the breast, and FGT inside the breast. For comparison, we applied two existing and published methods to our dataset: an atlas-based method and a sheetness-based method. We used Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) to measure the performances of the automated methods, with respect to the manual segmentations. Additionally, we computed Pearson's correlation between the breast density values computed based on manual and automated segmentations. The average DSC values for breast segmentation were 0.933, 0.944, 0.863, and 0.848 obtained from 3C U-net, 2C U-nets, atlas-based method, and sheetness-based method, respectively. The average DSC values for FGT segmentation obtained from 3C U-net, 2C U-nets, and atlas-based methods were 0.850, 0.811, and 0.671, respectively. The correlation between breast density values based on 3C U-net and manual segmentations was 0.974. This value was significantly higher than 0.957 as obtained from 2C U-nets (P < 0.0001, Steiger's Z-test with Bonferoni correction) and 0.938 as obtained from atlas-based method (P = 0.0016). In conclusion, we applied a deep-learning method, U-net, for segmenting breast and FGT in MRI in a dataset that includes a variety of MRI protocols and breast densities. Our results showed that U-net-based methods significantly outperformed the existing algorithms and resulted in significantly more accurate breast density computation.},

However, late-phase information might not be available in a screening setting, such as in abbreviated MRI protocols, where acquisition is limited to early-phase scans. We used deep learning to develop a CADe system that exploits the spatial information obtained from the early-phase scans. This system uses three-dimensional (3-D) morphological information in the candidate locations and the symmetry information arising from the enhancement differences of the two breasts. We compared the proposed system to a previously developed system, which uses the full dynamic breast MRI protocol. For training and testing, we used 385 MRI scans, containing 161 malignant lesions. Performance was measured by averaging the sensitivity values between 1/8-eight false positives. In our experiments, the proposed system obtained a significantly ([Formula: see text]) higher average sensitivity ([Formula: see text]) compared with that of the previous CADe system ([Formula: see text]). In conclusion, we developed a CADe system that is able to exploit the spatial information obtained from the early-phase scans and can be used in screening programs where abbreviated MRI protocols are used.},

  abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: We investigated artificial intelligence (AI)-based classification of benign and malignant breast lesions imaged with a multiparametric breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol with ultrafast dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient mapping. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 576 lesions imaged with MRI, including a consecutive set of biopsied malignant (368) and benign (149) lesions, and an additional set of 59 benign lesions proven by follow-up. We used deep learning methods to interpret ultrafast dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and T2-weighted information. A random forests classifier combined the output with patient information (PI; age and BRCA status) and apparent diffusion coefficient values obtained from diffusion-weighted imaging to perform the final lesion classification. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate our results. Sensitivity and specificity were compared with the results of the prospective clinical evaluation by radiologists. RESULTS: The area under the ROC curve was 0.811 when only ultrafast dynamics was used. The final AI system that combined all imaging information with PI resulted in an area under the ROC curve of 0.852, significantly higher than the ultrafast dynamics alone (P = 0.002). When operating at the same sensitivity level of radiologists in this dataset, this system produced 19 less false-positives than the number of biopsied benign lesions in our dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Use of adjunct imaging and PI has a significant contribution in diagnostic performance of ultrafast breast MRI. The developed AI system for interpretation of multiparametric ultrafast breast MRI may improve specificity.}},

  abstract = {Chest X-rays are one of the most commonly used technologies for medical diagnosis. Many deep learning models have been proposed to improve and automate the abnormality detection task on this type of data. In this paper, we propose a different approach based on image inpainting under adversarial training first introduced by Goodfellow et al. We configure the context encoder model for this task and train it over 1.1M 128x128 images from healthy X-rays. The goal of our model is to reconstruct the missing central 64x64 patch. Once the model has learned how to inpaint healthy tissue, we test its performance on images with and without abnormalities. We discuss and motivate our results considering PSNR, MSE and SSIM scores as evaluation metrics. In addition, we conduct a 2AFC observer study showing that in half of the times an expert is unable to distinguish real images from the ones reconstructed using our model. By computing and visualizing the pixel-wise difference between source and reconstructed images, we can highlight abnormalities to simplify further detection and classification tasks.},

To achieve global parity in interpretation, semi-quantitative scoring systems have been developed based on observer assessments; these are widely used in scoring coronary artery disease, the arthritides and neurological conditions and for indicating the likelihood of malignancy. However, in an era of machine learning and artificial intelligence, it is increasingly desirable that we extract quantitative biomarkers from medical images that inform on disease detection, characterisation, monitoring and assessment of response to treatment. Quantitation has the potential to provide objective decision-support tools in the management pathway of patients. Despite this, the quantitative potential of imaging remains under-exploited because of variability of the measurement, lack of harmonised systems for data acquisition and analysis, and crucially, a paucity of evidence on how such quantitation potentially affects clinical decision-making and patient outcome. This article reviews the current evidence for the use of semi-quantitative and quantitative biomarkers in clinical settings at various stages of the disease pathway including diagnosis, staging and prognosis, as well as predicting and detecting treatment response. It critically appraises current practice and sets out recommendations for using imaging objectively to drive patient management decisions.},

Our database consisted of T1 and T2*-weighted pelvic MR images of 603 lymph nodes, enhanced by USPIO contrast medium. For each lymph node, one seed point was manually defined Three automated segmentation methods were compared: 1. Confidence Connected segmentation, extended with automated Bandwidth Factor selection; 2. Conventional Graph Cut segmentation; 3. Pseudo-segmentation by selecting a sphere around the seed point. All lymph nodes were also manually segmented by a radiologist. The resulting segmentations were used to calculate 2 features (mean T1 and T2* signal intensity). Linear discriminant analysis was used for classification. The diagnostic accuracy (AUC at ROC-analysis) was: 0.95 (Confidence- Connected); 0.95 (Graph-Cut); 0.85 (spheres); and 0.95 (manual segmentations). The CAD performance of both the Confidence Connected and Graph Cut methods was as good as the manual segmentation. The substantially lower performance of the sphere segmentations demonstrates the need for accurate segmentations, even in USPIO-enhanced images.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) of lymph node metastases may help reduce reading time and improve interpretation of the large amount of image data in a 3-D pelvic MRI exam. The purpose of this study was to develop an algorithm for automated segmentation of pelvic lymph nodes from a single seed point, as part of a CAD system for the classification of normal vs metastatic lymph nodes, and to evaluate its performance compared to other algorithms. METHODS: The authors' database consisted of pelvic MR images of 146 consecutive patients, acquired between January 2008 and April 2010. Each dataset included four different MR sequences, acquired after infusion of a lymph node specific contrast medium based on ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide. All data sets were analyzed by two expert readers who, reading in consensus, annotated and manually segmented the lymph nodes. The authors compared four segmentation algorithms: confidence connected region growing (CCRG), extended CCRG (ECC), graph cut segmentation (GCS), and a segmentation method based on a parametric shape and appearance model (PSAM). The methods were ranked based on spatial overlap with the manual segmentations, and based on diagnostic accuracy in a CAD system, with the experts' annotations as reference standard. RESULTS: A total of 2347 manually annotated lymph nodes were included in the analysis, of which 566 contained a metastasis. The mean spatial overlap (Dice similarity coefficient) was: 0.35 (CCRG), 0.57 (ECC), 0.44 (GCS), and 0.46 (PSAM). When combined with the classification system, the area under the ROC curve was: 0.805 (CCRG), 0.890 (ECC), 0.807 (GCS), 0.891 (PSAM), and 0.935 (manual segmentation). CONCLUSIONS: We identified two segmentation methods, ECC and PSAM, that achieve a high diagnostic accuracy when used in conjunction with a CAD system for classification of normal vs metastatic lymph nodes. The manual segmentations still achieve the highest diagnostic accuracy.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: Magnetic Resonance Lymphography (MRL) with ferumoxtran-10 as contrast agent has a high diagnostic accuracy in the detection of lymph node metastases in prostate cancer (PCa) patients, but ferumoxtran-10 is no longer available. Ferumoxytol may be an alternative. Our purpose was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of ferumoxytol-based MRL with ferumoxtran-10-based MRL. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Our dataset contained the MRL images from patients who had had two MRLs as part of their clinical work-up in 2009 or 2010: one with ferumoxtran-10 and one with ferumoxytol as contrast agent. Each MRL consisted of at least a 3D T1-weighted sequence and a 3D T2*-weighted sequence. Two expert readers (an experienced radiologist and an experienced researcher), reading in consensus, interpreted each lymph node as normal or metastasized, based on the contrast uptake pattern in the T2*-weighted images, and delineated the lymph nodes in both types of MRL. Based on these delineations, quantitative measurements of the contrast-induced signal decrease were performed using histogram analysis. Measurements of signal decrease inside the lymph nodes were used to discriminate metastatic from normal nodes. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were computed to compare diagnostic accuracy, and the statistical significance of the difference between the two contrast agents was tested using the R Project for Statistical Computing and the ROCKIT software package. RESULTS: A total of 57 lymph nodes from four patients were included in the analysis, of which 7 were metastatic. The AUC was 0.96 for ferumoxtran-10-MRL, which is similar to results found in previous studies, and 0.87 for ferumoxytol-MRL. The difference between ferumoxtran-10 and ferumoxytol was statistically significant (p<0.05). The difference between ferumoxytol-enhanced and non-enhanced imaging was also significant (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Although the number of lymph nodes included in this pilot study is limited, our results show that the performance of ferumoxytol-MRL is significantly lower than ferumoxtran-10-MRL. However, ferumoxytol-MRL has still a significantly higher discriminative performance compared to plain MRI. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: While ferumoxtran-10 performs best in the detection of nodal metastases but is not available, ferumoxytol improves accuracy compared to plain MRI and is recommended prior to PCa treatment planning.},

A total of 5089 lymph nodes were annotated. A fully automated computer-aided detection (CAD) system was developed to find lymph nodes in the MRL studies. The system incorporates voxel features based on image intensities, the Hessian matrix, and spatial position. After feature calculation, a GentleBoost-classifier in combination with local maxima detection was used to identify lymph node candidates. Multiatlas based anatomical information was added to the CAD system to assess whether this could improve performance. Using histogram analysis and free-receiver operating characteristic analysis, this was compared to a strategy where relative position features were used to encode anatomical information.Adding atlas-based anatomical information to the CAD system reduced false positive detections both visually and quantitatively. Median likelihood values of false positives decreased significantly in all annotated anatomical structures. The sensitivity increased from 53\% to 70\% at 10 false positives per lymph node.Adding anatomical information through atlas registration significantly improves an automated lymph node detection system for MRL images.},

In 2010, a set of consecutive patients who underwent intravenous MR Lymphography (MRL) were included. Signal suppression in normal lymph nodes in T2*-weighted images due to uptake of USPIO (Ultra-Small Superparamagnetic Particles of Iron Oxide) was quantified. Signal suppression by two USPIO contrast agents, ferumoxtran-10 and ferumoxytol was compared using Wilcoxon's signed rank test. Forty-four patients were included, of which all 44 had a ferumoxtran-10 MRL and 4 had additionally a ferumoxytol MRL. A total of 684 lymph nodes were identified in the images, of which 174 had been diagnosed as metastatic. USPIO-induced signal suppression in normal lymph nodes was significantly stronger in ferumoxtran-10 MRL than in ferumoxytol MRL (p < 0.005). T2* signal suppression in normal pelvic lymph nodes is significantly stronger with ferumoxtran-10 than with ferumoxytol, which may affect diagnostic accuracy.},

  abstract = {To investigate whether multi-view convolutional neural networks can improve a fully automated lymph node detection system for pelvic MR Lymphography (MRL) images of patients with prostate cancer. A fully automated computer-aided detection (CAD) system had been previously developed to detect lymph nodes in MRL studies. The CAD system was extended with three types of 2D multi-view convolutional neural networks (CNN) aiming to reduce false positives (FP). A 2D multi-view CNN is an efficient approximation of a 3D CNN, and three types were evaluated: a 1-view, 3-view, and 9-view 2D CNN. The three deep learning CNN architectures were trained and configured on retrospective data of 240 prostate cancer patients that received MRL images as the standard of care between January 2008 and April 2010. The MRL used ferumoxtran-10 as a contrast agent and comprised at least two imaging sequences: a 3D T1-weighted and a 3D T2*-weighted sequence. A total of 5089 lymph nodes were annotated by two expert readers, reading in consensus. A first experiment compared the performance with and without CNNs and a second experiment compared the individual contribution of the 1-view, 3-view, or 9-view architecture to the performance. The performances were visually compared using free-receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis and statistically compared using partial area under the FROC curve analysis. Training and analysis were performed using bootstrapped FROC and 5-fold cross-validation. Adding multi-view CNNs significantly (  < 0.01) reduced false positive detections. The 3-view and 9-view CNN outperformed (  < 0.01) the 1-view CNN, reducing FP from 20.6 to 7.8/image at 80% sensitivity. Multi-view convolutional neural networks significantly reduce false positives in a lymph node detection system for MRL images, and three orthogonal views are sufficient. At the achieved level of performance, CAD for MRL may help speed up finding lymph nodes and assessing them for potential metastatic involvement.},

Collection of CAC scores simultaneously with MPI is unexplored. We aimed to investigate whether automatically derived CAC scores during myocardial perfusion imaging would further improve the diagnostic accuracy of MPI to detect obstructive CAD. We analyzed 150 consecutive patients without a history of coronary revascularization with suspected obstructive CAD who were referred for 82Rb PET/CT and available coronary angiographic data. Myocardial perfusion was evaluated both semi quantitatively as well as quantitatively according to the European guidelines. CAC scores were automatically derived from the low-dose attenuation correction CT scans using previously developed software based on deep learning. Obstructive CAD was defined as stenosis >70% (or >50% in the left main coronary artery) and/or fractional flow reserve (FFR) <=0.80. In total 58% of patients had obstructive CAD of which seventy-four percent were male. Addition of CAC scores to MPI and clinical predictors significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy of MPI to detect obstructive CAD. The area under the curve (AUC) increased from 0.87 to 0.91 (p: 0.025). Sensitivity and specificity analysis showed an incremental decrease in false negative tests with our MPI+CAC approach (n=14 to n=4), as a consequence an increase in false positive tests was seen (n=11 to n=28). CAC scores collected simultaneously with MPI improve the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease in patients without a history of coronary revascularization.},

In population studies, high levels of OPG are associated with events. In animal studies, however, high OPG levels result in reduction of VC. VSMC-derived EVs are assumed to be responsible for OPG transport and VC but this role has not been studied. For this, we investigated the association between OPG in plasma and circulating EVs with coronary artery calcium (CAC) as surrogate for VC in symptomatic patients. We retrospectively assessed 742 patients undergoing myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). CAC scores were determined on the MPI-CT images using a previously developed automated algorithm. Levels of OPG were quantified in plasma and two EV-subpopulations (LDL and TEX), using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Circulating levels of OPG were independently associated with CAC scores in plasma; OR 1.39 (95\% CI 1.17\textendash 1.65), and both EV populations; EV-LDL; OR 1.51 (95\% CI 1.27\textendash 1.80) and EV-TEX; OR 1.21 (95\% CI 1.02\textendash 1.42). High levels of OPG in plasma were independently associated with CAC scores in this symptomatic patient cohort. High levels of EV-derived OPG showed the same positive association with CAC scores, suggesting that EV-derived OPG mirrors the same pathophysiological process as plasma OPG.},

  abstract = {In previous work, singular points (or top points) in the scale space representation of generic images have proven valuable for image matching. In this paper, we propose a novel construction that encodes the scale space description of top points in the form of a directed acyclic graph. This representation allows us to utilize coarse-to-fine graph matching algorithms for comparing images represented in terms of top point configurations instead of using solely the top points and their features in a point matching algorithm, as was done previously. The nodes of the graph represent the critical paths together with their top points. The edge set captures the neighborhood distribution of vertices in scale space, and is constructed through a hierarchical tessellation of scale space using a Delaunay triangulation of the top points. We present a coarse-to-fine many-to-many matching algorithm for comparing such graph-based representations. The algorithm is based on a metric-tree representation of labeled graphs and their low-distortion embeddings into normed vector spaces via spherical encoding. This is a two-step transformation that reduces the matching problem to that of computing a distribution-based distance measure between two such embeddings. To evaluate the quality of our representation, four sets of experiments are performed. First, the stability of this representation under Gaussian noise of increasing magnitude is examined. Second, a series of recognition experiments is run on a face database. Third, a set of clutter and occlusion experiments is performed to measure the robustness of the algorithm. Fourth, the algorithm is compared to a leading interest point-based framework in an object recognition experiment.},

We investigate the performance of unsupervised and supervised deep learning methods when few labelled data are available. Three methods are compared: clustering autoencoder latent vectors (unsupervised), a single layer classifier combined with a pre-trained autoencoder (semi-supervised), and a supervised CNN. We apply these methods on hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained prostatectomy images to classify tumour versus non-tumour tissue. Results show that semi-/unsupervised methods have an advantage over supervised learning when few labels are available.

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: In prostate cancer patients, the presence of lymph node metastasis is an important factor when evaluating treatment options. MRL may help reduce the need of invasive staging by PLND. PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of the results of MR Lymphography (MRL), compared to using the Nodal Risk Formula (NRF), on the probability of lymph node metastases. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Our database contained 375 consecutive patients with prostate cancer, included retrospectively, who had a serum PSA level >10 ng/ml or a Gleason Sum (GS) > 6. All patients had been assessed by MR Lymphography (MRL) between 4/8/2003 and 4/19/2005, and had undergone pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) or fine-needle aspiration biopsy. A contrast agent based on ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIO) was used to dicriminate lymph node metastases from normal lymphatic tissue. All MRL images were analysed by a radiologist. The risk of lymph node metastasis (Rm) was estimated using the Roach Nodal Risk Formula (NRF): Rm=(2/3)*PSA+[(GS-6)*10], where an outcome >15 is considered high risk. Two logistic regression models were constructed. In both, the result of histopathology of the lymph nodes was the dependent variable and the NRF result was taken as independent variable. In one of the models, the result of MRL was added as a second independent variable. The impact of interactive terms was also estimated. RESULTS: Positive lymph nodes were detected by histology in in 61 out of 375 patients (16%). A total of 21 out of 312 patients with a negative MRL result had metastatic lymph nodes. Of the 63 patients with a positive MRL result, 40 had metastatic lymph nodes. A total of 13 out of 131 with low risk according to NRF had metastatic lymph nodes. Of the 244 patients with a high risk according to NRF, only 48 had metastatic lymph nodes. In the regression analysis, interactive terms were not statistically significant and were excluded from the model. After including the result of MRL in the logistic regression model, the outcome of the NRF was no longer significant. The result of MRL was significant in the model (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: MRL has a significant effect on the probability of lymph node involvement. As soon as the result of MRL is known, computing the nodal risk with the Nodal Risk Formula is no longer appropriate.},

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Logistic regression analysis was performed with the results of histopathological evaluation of the LN as dependent variable and the nodal risk according to the NRF and the result of MRL as independent input variables. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the performance of the models. RESULTS: The analysis included 375 patients. In the single-predictor regression models, the NRF and MRL results were both significantly (p <0.001) predictive of the presence of LN metastasis. In the models with both predictors included, NRF was nonsignificant (p = 0.126), but MRL remained significant (p <0.001). For NRF, sensitivity was 0.79 and specificity was 0.38; for MRL, sensitivity was 0.82 and specificity was 0.93. After a negative MRL result, the probability of LN metastasis is 4\% regardless of the NRF result. After a positive MRL, the probability of having LN metastasis is 68\%. CONCLUSIONS: MRL is a better predictor of the presence of LN metastasis than NRF. Using only the NRF can lead to a significant overtreatment on the pelvic LN by radiation therapy. When the MRL result is available, the NRF is no longer of added value.},

  abstract = {Objective: Nasal administration gives a more acute but shorter rise in serum hormone levels than oral administration and may therefore have less effect on the fibroglandular tissue in the breasts. We studied the change in mammographic breast density after nasal vs. oral administration of postmenopausal hormone therapy (PHT). Methods: We studied participants in a randomized, controlled trial on the impact of nasal vs. oral administration of PHT (combined 17A-A?A 1/2 -estradiol plus norethisterone) for 1 year. Two radiologists classified mammographic density at baseline and after 1 year into four categories. Also, the percentage density was calculated by a computer-based method. The main outcome measure was the difference in the proportion of women with an increase in mammographic density category after 1 year between the nasal and oral groups. Also, the change in the percentage density was calculated. Results: The study group comprised 112 healthy postmenopausal women (mean age 56 years), of whom 53 received oral and 59 intranasal PHT. An increase in mammographic density category after 1 year was seen in 20\% of the women in the nasal group and in 34\% of the oral group. This resulted in a non-significant difference in the proportion of women in whom mammographic breast density had increased by 214\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 230\% to 2.7\%). The mean change in percentage density was 21.2\% in the nasal group and + 1.2\% in the oral group, yielding a 22.4\% differential effect (95\% CI 27.3\% to 2.5\%). Conclusions: One year of nasal PHT gave a smaller, although not statistically significant, increase in mammographic density than oral PHT. Remaining issues are the relation between the route of administration of PHT and breast complaints and breast cancer risk.},

Functional measures are masked by motor neuron loss because of collateral reinnervation. A more direct measure is required. In this study, we evaluate a recent technique called MUNIX to determine motor neuron loss. METHODS: A model was constructed to study the effect of denervation and collateral reinnervation on surface motor unit potentials (MUPs). A small muscle containing 200 motor units was simulated. The process of motor neuron denervation is simulated by removing one motor neuron at a time leaving all its fibres orphaned. As muscle fibre loss after denervation is counteracted by reinnervation, the orphaned fibres could be reinnervated by a motor unit (MU) with a fibre adjacent to this fibre. MUNIX is calculated from the surface interference pattern (SIP) together with the maximal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) as described in by Nandedkar et al. (2003). Briefly, SIP area and SIP power are calculated for five levels of contractions. The motor unit count (ICMUC) is defined as ICMUC=(CMAPpower*SIParea)/(CMAParea*SIPpower). The ICMUC provides the real number of MUs if all MUs would be equal in size and no phase cancellation would occur. Since this is not the case, the relation between ICMUC and SIP area is determined as ICMUC=B*SIParea)^alpha, where B and alpha are determined by means of nonlinear regression and MUNIX is calculated as MUNIX=B(20)^alpha (inset figure 1). To test how well this method can follow motor neuron loss, we used the above denervation model and a MU firing pattern generated based on the model of Matthews et al. (1996). The size principle was applied creating the surface interference patterns, so that small MUs (i.e. small number of fibres) are recruited before and had a lower firing rate than large MUs. RESULTS: The MUNIX and CMAP results were evaluated in steps of 5% MU loss. We used different firing patterns and slightly different contraction levels (i.e. number of MUs) per run to obtain a measure of variability. Figure 1 shows that the MUNIX (blue) does not significantly decline until at least 40% of all MUs are lost and seems strongly related to the change in the CMAP amplitude (red). CONCLUSION: This preliminary simulation study shows that MUNIX follows motor neuron loss only slightly better than CMAP amplitude. The results after severe denervation should be interpreted with care as it is likely that the model is incorrect at this level.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Increased airway wall thickness (AWT) and parenchymal lung destruction both contribute to airflow limitation. Advances in computed tomography (CT) post-processing imaging allow to quantify these features. The aim of this Dutch population study is to assess the relationships between AWT, lung function, emphysema and respiratory symptoms. METHODS: AWT and emphysema were assessed by low-dose CT in 500 male heavy smokers, randomly selected from a lung cancer screening population. AWT was measured in each lung lobe in cross-sectionally reformatted images with an automated imaging program at locations with an internal diameter of 3.5 mm, and validated in smaller cohorts of patients. The 15th percentile method (Perc15) was used to assess the severity of emphysema. Information about respiratory symptoms and smoking behavior was collected by questionnaires and lung function by spirometry. RESULTS: Median AWT in airways with an internal diameter of 3.5 mm (AWT3.5) was 0.57 (0.44 - 0.74) mm. Median AWT in subjects without symptoms was 0.52 (0.41-0.66) and in those with dyspnea and/or wheezing 0.65 (0.52-0.81) mm (p<0.001). In the multivariate analysis only AWT3.5 and emphysema independently explained 31.1\%and 9.5\%of the variance in FEV1\%predicted, respectively, after adjustment for smoking behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Post processing standardization of airway wall measurements provides a reliable and useful method to assess airway wall thickness. Increased airway wall thickness contributes more to airflow limitation than emphysema in a smoking male population even after adjustment for smoking behavior.},

  abstract = {Rationale Airway wall thickness (AWT) is affected by both environmental and genetic factors and is strongly associated with airflow limitation in smaller airways. Objectives The aim of our study was to investigate its genetic component. Methods AWT was measured on low-dose CT-scans in male heavy smokers participating in a lung cancer screening study (n = 2,640). Genome wide association studies on AWT were performed under an additive model using linear regression (adjusted for pack-years, lung volume), followed by meta-analysis. An independent cohort was used for validation of the most strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The functional relevance of significant SNPs was evaluated. Measurements and main results Three significant loci on chromosomes 2q (rs734556, p = 6.2x10-7) and 10q (rs10794108, p = 8.6x10-8; rs7078439, p = 2.3x10-7) were associated with AWT and confirmed in the meta-analysis in cohorts with comparable lung function: p-values 4.6x10-8, 7.4x10-8 and 7.5x10-8, respectively. SNP rs734556 was associated with decreased lung tissue expression of SERPINE2, a susceptibility gene for emphysema. Two nominally significant SNPs showed effects with similar direction: rs10251504 in MAGI2 (p = 5.8x10-7) and rs4796712 in NT5C3B (p = 3.1x10-6). Higher MAGI2 expression in bronchial biopsies of COPD patients was significantly associated with lower inflammatory cell numbers, lower NT5C3B expression with worse lung function. The NT5C3B risk allele was associated with higher lung tissue expression (p = 1.09x10-41). Conclusions Genetic variants contribute to AWT. Amongst others, the identified genes are involved in emphysema, airway obstruction and bronchial inflammation.},

  journal = {arXiv:1908.10715},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {We introduce the learned simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) for tomographic reconstruction. The learned SIRT algorithm is a deep learning based reconstruction method combining model knowledge with a learned component. The algorithm is trained by mapping raw measured data to the reconstruction results over several iterations. The Learned SIRT algorithm is applied to a cone beam geometry on a circular orbit, a challenging problem for learned methods due to its 3D geometry and its inherent inability to completely capture the patient anatomy. A comparison of 2D reconstructions is shown, where the learned SIRT approach produces reconstructions with superior peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM), compared to FBP, SIRT and U-net post-processing and similar PSNR and SSIM compared to the learned primal dual algorithm. Similar results are shown for cone beam geometry reconstructions of a 3D Shepp Logan phantom, where we obtain between 9.9 and 28.1 dB improvement over FBP with a substantial improvement in SSIM. Finally we show that our algorithm scales to clinically relevant problems, and performs well when applied to measurements of a physical phantom.},

  booktitle = ECR,
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Purpose: In many clinical situations, only thick slice CT lung studies are available due to storage, transmission or acquisition constraints. However, it is still desirable to have CAD available as a tool. Unfortunately, most commercial Lung CAD systems operate only on thin slice (< 2.5mm) input data. We evaluate the detection capability of a prototype thick slice Lung Nodule CAD system. Methods and Materials: The system was evaluated using 131 unseen cases, from institutions in the United States and Europe, using various vendor?s scanners. Group 1 (G1, n=60) included cases from Siemens? scanners (VolumeZoom=12, Sensation16=31, Sensation64=17) at 5mmq5mm. Group 2 (G2, n=35) with cases from Philip?s scanner (Mx8000 16) at slice thickness 6.5mmq5mm slice interval. Group 3 (G3 n=36) with cases from GE?s scanner (LightSpeed 16) at 5mmq5mm. The prototype?s performance was evaluated on all nodules with diameter range 6-25mm. Group G1 had 42 solid and part-solid pulmonary nodules, G2 had 40 and G3 had 59. Results: For G1, per-nodule sensitivity was 90.4% with an average FP of 4/case. For G2 per-nodule sensitivity was 72.5% with an average FP of 3.05/case and for G3 per-nodule sensitivity was 78% with average FP of 2/case. Conclusion: The prototype generalized across scanners from multiple vendors, models, and different sites. The system has the potential to extend the practical range of acquisition data over which Lung CAD may be applied to help overcome existing constraints on CAD utilization.},

We examined the associations of maternal and paternal smoking during pregnancy with total and abdominal fat distribution in school-age children.Methods:We performed a population-based prospective cohort study among 5243 children followed from early pregnancy onward in the Netherlands. Information about parental smoking was obtained by questionnaires during pregnancy. At the median age of 6.0 years (90% range: 5.7-7.4), we measured anthropometrics, total fat and android/gynoid fat ratio by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and preperitoneal and subcutaneous abdominal fat were measured by ultrasound.Results:The associations of maternal smoking during pregnancy were only present among girls (P-value for sex interaction<0.05). Compared with girls from mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy, those from mothers who smoked during the first trimester only had a higher android/gynoid fat ratio (difference 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.09-0.37) s.d. scores (SDS). Girls from mothers who continued smoking throughout pregnancy had a higher body mass index (difference: 0.24 (95% CI: 0.14-0.35) SDS), total fat mass (difference: 0.23 (95% CI: 0.14-0.33) SDS), android/gynoid fat ratio (difference: 0.34 (95% CI: 0.22-0.46) SDS), subcutaneous abdominal fat (difference: 0.22 (95% CI: 0.11-0.33) SDS) and preperitoneal abdominal fat (difference: 0.20 (95% CI: 0.08-0.31) SDS). Similar associations with body fat distribution outcomes were observed for paternal smoking during pregnancy. Both continued maternal and paternal smoking during pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of childhood overweight. The corresponding odds ratios were 1.19 (95% CI: 0.98-1.46) and 1.32 (1.10-1.58), respectively.Conclusions:Maternal and paternal smoking during pregnancy are associated with an adverse body and abdominal fat distribution and increased risk of overweight in children. Similar effects of maternal and paternal smoking suggest that direct intrauterine mechanisms and common family-based lifestyle-related factors explain the associations.},

  abstract = {Cellularity estimation forms an important aspect of the visual examination of bone marrow biopsies. In clinical practice, cellularity is estimated by eye under a microscope, which is rapid, but subjective and subject to inter- and intraobserver variability. In addition, there is little consensus in the literature on the normal variation of cellularity with age. Digital image analysis may be used for more objective quantification of cellularity. As such, we developed a deep neural network for the segmentation of six major cell and tissue types in digitized bone marrow trephine biopsies. Using this segmentation, we calculated the overall bone marrow cellularity in a series of biopsies from 130 patients across a wide age range. Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), we measured the agreement between the quantification by the neural network and visual estimation by two pathologists and compared it to baseline human performance. We also examined the age-related changes of cellularity and cell lineages in bone marrow and compared our results to those found in the literature. The network was capable of accurate segmentation (average accuracy and dice score of 0.95 and 0.76, respectively). There was good neural network-pathologist agreement on cellularity measurements (ICC=0.78, 95% CI 0.58-0.85). We found a statistically significant downward trend for cellularity, myelopoiesis and megakaryocytes with age in our cohort. The mean cellularity began at approximately 50% in the third decade of life and then decreased +-2% per decade to 40% in the seventh and eighth decade, but the normal range was very wide (30-70%).},

  abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the performance of computer-aided traumatic cerebral microbleed detection (CAD) with and without human interference.
                             Methods and Materials: 33 adult patients admitted to our emergency department with moderate or severe TBI (mean age 33 years, 21 males) underwent a standardized trauma 3T MRI-protocol at 28 weeks. The microbleeds in their SWI-scans were annotated by an expert. A CAD system was developed, based on this training set. Six experts, blind to the CAD-results, annotated a subset of ten patients. In two experiments, we compared the performance of the CAD system to each of these six experts, using the majority voting results of the other five experts as the reference standard for the calculation of performance characteristics (paired t-test). In the first experiment, the performance of fully automatic microbleed detection was assessed. In the second experiment, one expert removed CAD-annotations she considered false positives from the automatically detected microbleeds, and briefly screened the CAD-annotated SWI-scans to complete the dataset with missed definite microbleeds.
                             Results: Fully manual evaluation took one hour per patient with an average sensitivity of 77% (SD 12.4%). The sensitivity of fully automatic detection of candidate microbleeds was 89% (SD 0.8%). Evaluation of the CAD results by an expert took 13 minutes per patient with a sensitivity of 93% (SD 1.0%) (p < 0.05 versus fully manual evaluation).
                             Conclusion: This CAD system allows detecting more microbleeds in a reduced reading time. This may facilitate the execution of otherwise too time-consuming large studies on the clinical relevance of microbleeds.},

  abstract = {Variations in the color and intensity of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histological slides can potentially hamper the effectiveness of quantitative image analysis. This paper presents a fully automated algorithm for standardization of whole-slide histopathological images to reduce the effect of these variations. The proposed algorithm, called whole-slide image color standardizer (WSICS), utilizes color and spatial information to classify the image pixels into different stain components. The chromatic and density distributions for each of the stain components in the hue-saturation-density color model are aligned to match the corresponding distributions from a template wholeslide image (WSI). The performance of the WSICS algorithm was evaluated on two datasets. The first originated from 125 H&E stained WSIs of lymph nodes, sampled from 3 patients, and stained in 5 different laboratories on different days of the week. The second comprised 30 H&E stained WSIs of rat liver sections. The result of qualitative and quantitative evaluations using the first dataset demonstrate that the WSICS algorithm outperforms competing methods in terms of achieving color constancy. The WSICS algorithm consistently yields the smallest standard deviation and coefficient of variation of the normalized median intensity measure. Using the second dataset, we evaluated the impact of our algorithm on the performance of an already published necrosis quantification system. The performance of this system was significantly improved by utilizing the WSICS algorithm. The results of the empirical evaluations collectively demonstrate the potential contribution of the proposed standardization algorithm to improved diagnostic accuracy and consistency in computer-aided diagnosis for histopathology data.},

  abstract = {This paper presents and evaluates a fully automatic method for detection of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in digitized hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histopathological slides of breast tissue. The proposed method applies multi-scale superpixel classification to detect epithelial regions in whole-slide images (WSIs). Subsequently, spatial clustering is utilized to delineate regions representing meaningful structures within the tissue such as ducts and lobules. A region-based classifier employing a large set of features including statistical and structural texture features and architectural features is then trained to discriminate between DCIS and benign/normal structures. The system is evaluated on two datasets containing a total of 205 WSIs of breast tissue. Evaluation was conducted both on the slide and the lesion level using FROC analysis. The results show that to detect at least one true positive in every DCIS containing slide, the system finds 2.6 false positives per WSI. The results of the per-lesion evaluation show that it is possible to detect 80% and 83% of the DCIS lesions in an abnormal slide, at an average of 2.0 and 3.0 false positives per WSI, respectively. Collectively, the result of the experiments demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed method as well as its potential for application in routine pathological diagnostics.

  abstract = {Application of deep learning algorithms to whole-slide pathology images can potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Assess the performance of automated deep learning algorithms at detecting metastases in hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of lymph nodes of women with breast cancer and compare it with pathologists' diagnoses in a diagnostic setting. Researcher challenge competition (CAMELYON16) to develop automated solutions for detecting lymph node metastases (November 2015-November 2016). A training data set of whole-slide images from 2 centers in the Netherlands with (n = 110) and without (n = 160) nodal metastases verified by immunohistochemical staining were provided to challenge participants to build algorithms. Algorithm performance was evaluated in an independent test set of 129 whole-slide images (49 with and 80 without metastases). The same test set of corresponding glass slides was also evaluated by a panel of 11 pathologists with time constraint (WTC) from the Netherlands to ascertain likelihood of nodal metastases for each slide in a flexible 2-hour session, simulating routine pathology workflow, and by 1 pathologist without time constraint (WOTC). Deep learning algorithms submitted as part of a challenge competition or pathologist interpretation. The presence of specific metastatic foci and the absence vs presence of lymph node metastasis in a slide or image using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The 11 pathologists participating in the simulation exercise rated their diagnostic confidence as definitely normal, probably normal, equivocal, probably tumor, or definitely tumor. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.556 to 0.994. The top-performing algorithm achieved a lesion-level, true-positive fraction comparable with that of the pathologist WOTC (72.4% [95% CI, 64.3%-80.4%]) at a mean of 0.0125 false-positives per normal whole-slide image. For the whole-slide image classification task, the best algorithm (AUC, 0.994 [95% CI, 0.983-0.999]) performed significantly better than the pathologists WTC in a diagnostic simulation (mean AUC, 0.810 [range, 0.738-0.884]; P < .001). The top 5 algorithms had a mean AUC that was comparable with the pathologist interpreting the slides in the absence of time constraints (mean AUC, 0.960 [range, 0.923-0.994] for the top 5 algorithms vs 0.966 [95% CI, 0.927-0.998] for the pathologist WOTC). In the setting of a challenge competition, some deep learning algorithms achieved better diagnostic performance than a panel of 11 pathologists participating in a simulation exercise designed to mimic routine pathology workflow; algorithm performance was comparable with an expert pathologist interpreting whole-slide images without time constraints. Whether this approach has clinical utility will require evaluation in a clinical setting.},

  abstract = {The breast stromal microenvironment is a pivotal factor in breast cancer development, growth and metastases. Although pathologists often detect morphologic changes in stroma by light microscopy, visual classification of such changes is subjective and non-quantitative, limiting its diagnostic utility. To gain insights into stromal changes associated with breast cancer, we applied automated machine learning techniques to digital images of 2387 hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue sections of benign and malignant image-guided breast biopsies performed to investigate mammographic abnormalities among 882 patients, ages 40-65 years, that were enrolled in the Breast Radiology Evaluation and Study of Tissues (BREAST) Stamp Project. Using deep convolutional neural networks, we trained an algorithm to discriminate between stroma surrounding invasive cancer and stroma from benign biopsies. In test sets (928 whole-slide images from 330 patients), this algorithm could distinguish biopsies diagnosed as invasive cancer from benign biopsies solely based on the stromal characteristics (area under the receiver operator characteristics curve = 0.962). Furthermore, without being trained specifically using ductal carcinoma in situ as an outcome, the algorithm detected tumor-associated stroma in greater amounts and at larger distances from grade 3 versus grade 1 ductal carcinoma in situ. Collectively, these results suggest that algorithms based on deep convolutional neural networks that evaluate only stroma may prove useful to classify breast biopsies and aid in understanding and evaluating the biology of breast lesions.},

  abstract = {Women with extremely dense breasts have an increased risk of breast cancer and lower mammographic tumor detectability. Nevertheless, in most countries, these women are currently screened with mammography only. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has the potential to improve breast cancer detection at an early stage because of its higher sensitivity. However, MR imaging is more expensive and is expected to be accompanied by an increase in the number of false-positive results and, possibly, an increase in overdiagnosis. To study the additional value of MR imaging, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design is needed in which one group undergoes mammography and the other group undergoes mammography and MR imaging. With this design, it is possible to determine the proportion of interval cancers within each study arm. For this to be an effective screening strategy, the additional cancers detected at MR imaging screening must be accompanied by a subsequent reduction in interval cancers. The Dense Tissue and Early Breast Neoplasm Screening, or DENSE, trial is a multicenter RCT performed in the Dutch biennial population-based screening program (subject age range, 50-75 years). The study was approved by the Dutch Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport. In this study, mammographic density is measured by using a fully automated volumetric method. Participants with extremely dense breasts (American College of Radiology breast density category 4) and a negative result at mammography (Breast Imaging Recording and Data System category 1 or 2) are randomly assigned to undergo additional MR imaging (n = 7237) or to be treated according to current practice (n = 28 948). Participants provide written informed consent before the MR imaging examination, which consists of dynamic breast MR imaging with gadolinium-based contrast medium and is intended to be performed for three consecutive screening rounds. The primary outcome is the difference in the proportions of interval cancers between the study arms. Secondary outcomes are the number of MR imaging screening-detected cancers, proportions of false-positive results, diagnostic yield of MR imaging, tumor characteristics, quality of life, and cost effectiveness.

In literature various approaches have been described to establish correspondence between multiple views. Highnam et al. [1] used a model-based method to find a curve in the MLO view which corresponds to the potential positions of a point in the CC view. Kok-Wiles et al. [2] used a representation of the nested structure of ?salient? bright regions to match mammogram pairs. Karssemeijer et al. [3] and Lau et al. [4] both used a set of landmarks and applied a nonlinear interpolation to align the skin line of two breast images. Almost all matching approaches are based on acquiring a set of landmarks. In a mammogram the nipple is the most obvious landmark. Radiologists use the distance to the nipple to correlate a lesion in MLO and CC view. It is generally believed that this distance remains fairly constant. The goal of this paper is twofold: first, to investigate to what extent this distance remains constant in multiple views, and second, to investigate if the accuracy of automated detection of the nipple is sufficient to use the distance to the nipple as a reliable measure for matching. For this purpose we used an annotated database which contained 327 corresponding mammogram pairs from the Dutch breast cancer screening program.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS {O}f 58 patients with prostatic carcinoma, 36 were included for analysis. {P}atients underwent {MR} imaging at 1.5 {T} with an endorectal-pelvic phased-array coil and subsequently underwent prostatectomy. {A} {T}2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequence, an intermediate-weighted sequence, and a fast {T}1-weighted gradient-echo sequence (seven sections in 2.03 seconds) during bolus injection of 0.1 mmol gadopentetate dimeglumine per kilogram of body weight were performed. {C}ontrast agent concentration-time curves were obtained for prostatic carcinoma and normal {PZ} and {CG} tissue by using whole-mount sections to guide placement of regions of interest. {O}nset time, time to peak, peak enhancement, relative peak enhancement, washout, and {T}2 relaxation rates were calculated. {M}ultivariate receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed with and without relative peak enhancement. RESULTS {R}esults of multivariate receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that relative peak enhancement demonstrated the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}) in the {PZ} and the {CG} ({AUC} = 0.93, 0.82). {R}esults of multivariate analysis without relative peak enhancement showed that relative peak enhancement in the {PZ} and washout in the {CG} demonstrated the highest {AUC} ({AUC} = 0.9, 0.81). {P}earson correlation coefficients between the dynamic parameters or {T}2 relaxation rates in carcinoma and the tumor stage, {G}leason score, patient age, and tumor markers ranged between 0.02 and 0.44. CONCLUSION {T}he optimal parameter for discrimination of prostatic carcinoma in the {PZ} and {CG} was relative peak enhancement. {I}f relative peak enhancement was not used, then peak enhancement was optimal in the {PZ}, and washout was optimal in the {CG}. {P}oor-to-moderate correlation was present between the dynamic parameters or {T}2 relaxation rate in carcinoma and the tumor stage, {G}leason score, patient age, tumor volume, and prostate-specific antigen.},

In this study, we made use of human observers to investigate the potential benefit of using context information for CAD. We investigated to what extent human readers make use of context information derived from the whole breast area and from asymmetry for the tasks of mass detection and classification. Results showed that context information can be used to improve CAD programs for mass detection. However, there is still a lot to be gained from improvement of local feature extraction and classification. This is demonstrated by the fact that the observers did much better in classifying true positive (TP) and false positive (FP) regions than the CAD program. For classification of benign and malignant masses context seems to be less important.},

This has encouraged us to develop a technique to regroup initial CAD detections to facilitate the final classification of suspicious regions. The regrouping technique searches for detections that belong to the same structure. Therefore, it takes into account the distance between the detections and the image structure along a path between the detections. When correspondence is found, the two detections are replaced by a new detection in between the initial detections. Our regrouping technique correctly regrouped the detections in 48 percent of the masses initially detected by multiple regions. Of the false positive detections two percent were combined, and the percentage of true positive - false positive combinations was one. Incorporation of thealgorithm into our CAD scheme resulted in a slight increase in detection performance. In addition, in our multiple view scheme it also resulted in a decrease in the number of incorrectly linked regions in corresponding mammographic views.},

During interpretation, radiologists use information from all available views, i.e. previous examinations and projections from different angles. Most current CAD systems, on the other hand, use information from only one view at the time. The research described in this thesis concerns the development of multiple view CAD techniques to increase the performance of CAD for the detection of masses in mammograms. The first part of this thesis addresses the comparison of temporal mammogram pairs. The second part concerns the combination of information from two projections of the same breast. The final chapter describes a method for accurate quantitative estimation of the dense tissue volume from mammograms.

  title = {Automatic Segmentation of Drusen and Exudates on Color Fundus Images using Generative Adversarial Networks},
  abstract = {Purpose: The presence of drusen and exudates, visible as bright lesions on color fundus images, is one of the early signs of visual threatening diseases such as Age-related Macular Degeneration and Diabetic Retinopathy. Accurate detection and quantification of these lesions during screening can help identify patients that would benefit from treatment. We developed a method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to segment bright lesions on color fundus images.

                             Methods: We used 4179 color fundus images that were acquired during clinical routine. The images were contrast enhanced to increase the contrast between bright lesions and the background. All bright lesions were manually annotated by marking the center point of the lesions. The GAN was trained to estimate the image without bright lesions. The final segmentation was obtained by taking the difference between the input image and the estimated output.

                             Results: This method was applied to an independent test set of 52 color fundus images with non-advanced stages of AMD from the European Genetic Database, which were fully segmented for bright lesions by two trained human observers. The method achieved Dice scores of 0.4862 and 0.4849 when compared to the observers, whereas the inter-observer Dice score was 0.5043. The total segmented bright lesion area per image was evaluated using the intraclass correlation (ICC). The method scored 0.8537 and 0.8352 when compared to the observers, whereas the inter-observer ICC was 0.8893.

                             Conclusions: The results show the performance is close to the agreement between trained observers. This automatic segmentation of bright lesions can help early diagnosis of visual threatening diseases and opens the way for large scale clinical trials.},

We investigated if automatic shape analysis of the trachea from inspiration and expiration computed tomography ({CT}) scans can improve {CT}-based classification of {COPD} patients into {GOLD} stages. {MATERIALS AND METHODS}: A database of 187 subjects of {GOLD} stages 0 through 4 was constructed. The trachea was automatically segmented on an automatically determined axial section 1 cm above the carina from both the inspiration and expiration scans. The tracheal shape ({TS}), encoded by the length of rays cast from the center of the trachea, and emphysema score ({ES}) at -950 {HU} on the inspiration scan, were used as features for classification. A nearest mean statistical classifier was trained to assign subjects to {GOLD} stage based on three sets of features: {ES}, {TS}, and {ES}+{TS}. {RESULTS}: Accuracy of {GOLD} stage classification was 42%, 41%, and 51% for {ES}, {TS}, and {ES}+{TS}, respectively. For distinguishing non-{COPD} subjects ({GOLD} 0) versus {COPD} patients ({GOLD} 1-4), accuracies were 67%, 72% and 80%. {CONCLUSIONS}: Tracheal shape can be extracted automatically from {CT} scans and is related to pulmonary function.

The aim of this study was to present a potential new method for the differential diagnosis of MM from melanocytic naevi (MN). We examined 20 MM and 19 MN with a new ultra-high-frequency ultrasound (UHFUS) equipped with a 70 MHz linear probe. Ultrasonographic images were processed for calculating 8 morphological parameters (area, perimeter, circularity, area ratio, standard deviation of normalized radial range, roughness index, overlap ratio and normalized residual mean square value) and 122 texture parameters. Colour Doppler images were used to evaluate the vascularization. Features reduction was implemented by means of principal component analysis (PCA), and 23 classification algorithms were tested on the reduced features using histological response as ground-truth. Best results were obtained using only the first component of the PCA and the weighted k-nearest neighbour classifier; this combination led to an accuracy of 76.9%, area under the ROC curve of 83%, sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 70%. The histological analysis still remains the gold-standard, but the UHFUS images processing using a machine learning approach could represent a new non-invasive approach.},

  year = {2020},
  abstract = {Identifying pathology in medical imaging data is a crucial step for patient diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks, has led to breakthroughs in computer-aided diagnosis and detection. Nonetheless, these methods are heavily dependent on large number of training samples, which is not often available in medical imaging field. Moreover, while state-of-art supervised segmentation methods rely on precise voxel-wise annotations, manual lesion delineation in medical images is extremely laborious and time consuming task. Recent advancements in the field of generative adversarial networks (GAN) show promising results in generating realistic data samples for the purpose of augmenting datasets for downstream tasks, however the quality of samples generated by GANs also depends on the variability and size of the training set, particularly for large images. Unlike the majority of recent GAN methods, which focus on generation of either unlabeled samples or data restricted to particular classes, we propose a framework for controllable pathological image synthesis. Our approach is inspired by CycleGAN, where instead of generating images from random noise, we perform cycle-consistent image-to-image translation between two domains: healthy and pathological. Guided by a semantic map, an adversarially trained generator synthesizes pathology on a healthy image in the specified location. We demonstrate our approach in two distinct applications: a public dataset for brain tumors segmentation (BraTS2018) and an institutional dataset of cerebral microbleeds in traumatic brain injury patients. We subsequently utilize synthetic images generated with our method for data augmentation for the detection of cerebral microbleeds. Enriching the training dataset with synthetic images produced by our method exhibits the potential to increase sensitivity of cerebral microbleeds in traumatic brain injury detection system. The model trained only on real samples achieves an average sensitivity of 88% at 20 false positives per patient, after augmenting the training set with synthetic samples the model achieves an average sensitivity of 92% at the same rate of false positives per patient.},

  abstract = {Lack of annotated data is a major challenge to machine learning algorithms, particularly in the field of radiology. Algorithms that can efficiently extract labels in a fast and precise manner are in high demand. Weak supervision is a compromise solution, particularly, when dealing with imaging modalities like Computed Tomography (CT), where the number of slices can reach 1000 per case. Radiology reports store crucial information about clinicians' findings and observations in CT slices. Automatic generation of labels from CT reports is not a trivial task due to the complexity of sentences and diversity of expression in free-text narration. In this study, we focus on abnormality classification in lungs, liver and kidneys. Firstly, a rule-based model is used to extract weak labels at the case level. Afterwards, attention guided recurrent neural network (RNN) is trained to perform binary classification of radiology reports in terms of whether the organ is normal or abnormal. Additionally, a multi-label RNN with attention mechanism is trained to perform binary classification by aggregating its output for four representative diseases (lungs: emphysema, mass-nodule, effusion and atelectasis-pneumonia; liver: dilatation, fatty infiltration-steatosis, calcification-stone-gallstone, lesion-mass; kidneys: atrophy, cyst, stone-calculi, lesion) into a single abnormal class. Performance has been evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) on 274, 306 and 278 reports for lungs, liver and kidneys correspondingly, manually annotated by radiology experts. The change in performance was evaluated for different sizes of training dataset for lungs. The AUCs of multi-label pretrained models: lungs - 0.929, liver - 0.840, kidney - 0.844; multi-label models: lungs - 0.903, liver - 0.848, kidney - 0.906; binary pretrained models: lungs - 0.922, liver - 0.826, kidneys - 0.928.},

  abstract = {Abstract Introduction: Classification of COPD is currently based on the presence and severity of airways obstruction. However, this may not fully reflect the phenotypic heterogeneity of COPD in the (ex-) smoking community. We hypothesized that factor analysis followed by cluster analysis of functional, clinical, radiological and exhaled breath metabolomic features identifies subphenotypes of COPD in a community-based population of heavy (ex-) smokers. Methods: Adults between 50-75 years with a smoking history of at least 15 pack-years derived from a random population-based survey as part of the NELSON study underwent detailed assessment of pulmonary function, chest CT scanning, questionnaires and exhaled breath molecular profiling using an electronic nose. Factor and cluster analyses were performed on the subgroup of subjects fulfilling the GOLD criteria for COPD (post-BD FEV1/FVC < 0.70). Results: Three hundred subjects were recruited, of which 157 fulfilled the criteria for COPD and were included in the factor and cluster analysis. Four clusters were identified: cluster 1 (n = 35; 22\%): mild COPD, limited symptoms and good quality of life. Cluster 2 (n = 48; 31\%): low lung function, combined emphysema and chronic bronchitis and a distinct breath molecular profile. Cluster 3 (n = 60; 38\%): emphysema predominant COPD with preserved lung function. Cluster 4 (n = 14; 9\%): highly symptomatic COPD with mildly impaired lung function. In a leave-one-out validation analysis an accuracy of 97.4\% was reached. Conclusions: This unbiased taxonomy for mild to moderate COPD reinforces clusters found in previous studies and thereby allows better phenotyping of COPD in the general (ex-) smoking population.},

  abstract = {Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. To determine early treatment for patients, it is critical to accurately classify the cervical intraepithelial lesion status based on a microscopic biopsy. Lesion classification is a 4-class problem, with biopsies being designated as benign or increasingly malignant as class 1-3, with 3 being invasive cancer. Unfortunately, traditional biopsy analysis by a pathologist is time-consuming and subject to intra-and inter-observer variability. For this reason, it is of interest to develop automatic analysis pipelines to classify lesion status directly from a digitalized whole slide image (WSI). The recent TissueNet Challenge was organized to find the best automatic detection pipeline for this task, using a dataset of 1015 annotated WSI slides. In this work, we present our winning end-to-end solution for cervical slide classification composed of a two-step classification model: First, we classify individual slide patches using an ensemble CNN, followed by an SVM-based slide classification using statistical features of the aggregated patch-level predictions. Importantly, we present the key innovation of our approach, which is a novel partial label-based loss function that allows us to supplement the supervised WSI patch annotations with weakly supervised patches based on the WSI class. This led to us not requiring additional expert tissue annotation, while still reaching the winning score of 94.7%. Our approach is a step towards the clinical inclusion of automatic pipelines for cervical cancer treatment planning.

This observational study consists of a cross-sectional and a longitudinal part. Functional outcome measures assessed under low contrast and low luminance have the potential to detect progression of visual deficit within iAMD and to late AMD. Structural outcome measures will be multimodal and investigate topographical relationships with function. Current patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are not acceptable to regulators and may not capture the functional deficit specific to iAMD with needed precision, justifying development of novel PROMs for iAMD. The total sample size will be n = 750, consisting mainly of subjects with iAMD (n = 600). As clinical endpoints currently accepted by regulators cannot detect functional loss or patient-relevant impact in iAMD, we will clinically validate novel candidate endpoints for iAMD.},

  abstract = {Intracranial aneurysm volume and shape are important factors for predicting rupture risk, for pre-surgical planning and for follow-up studies. To obtain these parameters, manual segmentation can be employed; however, this is a tedious procedure, which is prone to inter- and intra-observer variability. Therefore there is a need for an automated method, which is accurate, reproducible and reliable. This study aims to develop and validate an automated method for segmenting intracranial aneurysms in Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) data. Also, it is investigated whether prior smoothing improves segmentation robustness and accuracy. The proposed segmentation method is implemented in the level set framework, more specifically Geodesic Active Surfaces, in which a surface is evolved to capture the aneurysmal wall via an energy minimization approach. The energy term is composed of three different image features, namely; intensity, gradient magnitude and intensity variance. The method requires minimal user interaction, i.e. a single seed point inside the aneurysm needs to be placed, based on which image intensity statistics of the aneurysm are derived and used in defining the energy term. The method has been evaluated on 15 aneurysms in 11 CTA data sets by comparing the results to manual segmentations performed by two expert radiologists. Evaluation measures were Similarity Index, Average Surface Distance and Volume Difference. The results show that the automated aneurysm segmentation method is reproducible, and performs in the range of inter-observer variability in terms of accuracy. Smoothing by nonlinear diffusion with appropriate parameter settings prior to segmentation, slightly improves segmentation accuracy.},

  abstract = {Accurately quantifying aneurysm shape parameters is of clinical importance, as it is an important factor in choosing the right treatment modality (i.e. coiling or clipping), in predicting rupture risk and operative risk and for pre-surgical planning. The first step in aneurysm quantification is to segment it from other structures that are present in the image. As manual segmentation is a tedious procedure and prone to inter- and intra-observer variability, there is a need for an automated method which is accurate and reproducible. In this paper a novel semi-automated method for segmenting aneurysms in Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) data based on Geodesic Active Contours is presented and quantitatively evaluated. Three different image features are used to steer the level set to the boundary of the aneurysm, namely intensity, gradient magnitude and variance in intensity. The method requires minimum user interaction, i.e. clicking a single seed point inside the aneurysm which is used to estimate the vessel intensity distribution and to initialize the level set. The results show that the developed method is reproducible, and performs in the range of interobserver variability in terms of accuracy.},

In this paper a semi-automated method for quantifying aneurysm volume growth over time in CTA data is presented. The method treats a series of longitudinal images as a 4D dataset. Using a 4D non-rigid registration, deformations with respect to baseline scan are determined. Combined with 3D aneurysm segmentation in baseline scan, volume change is assessed by inspecting the deformation field at the aneurysm wall. The results of applying the method to 10 patient data are in line with the assessment in the radiology reports.},

  abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: Aneurysm morphodynamics is potentially relevant for assessing aneurysm rupture risk. A method is proposed for automated quantification and visualization of intracranial aneurysm morphodynamics from ECG-gated computed tomography angiography (CTA) data. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was performed in 19 aneurysms from 14 patients with diagnostic workup for recently discovered aneurysms (n=15) or follow-up of untreated known aneurysms (n=4). The study was approved by the IRB (Institutional Review Board) of the hospital and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. An image post-processing method was developed for quantifying aneurysm volume changes and visualizing local displacement of the aneurysmal wall over a heart cycle using multiphase ECG-gated (4D) CTA. Percentage volume changes over the heart cycle were determined for aneurysms, surrounding arteries and the skull. Results: Pulsation of the aneurysm and its surrounding vasculature during the heart cycle could be assessed from ECG-gated CTA data. The percentage aneurysmal volume change ranged from 3 -18%. Conclusion: ECG-gated CTA can be used to study morphodynamics of intracranial aneurysms. The proposed image analysis method is capable of quantifying the volume changes and visualizing local displacement of the vascular structures over the cardiac cycle.},

  abstract = {The focus of the research presented in this book is on morphometry and morphodynamic analysis of intracranial aneurysms in {CTA} using automated methods. The first step for such analysis is segmentation of aneurysm from other structures present in the image. Therefore, a novel semi-automatic segmentation method, implemented in the level set frame work, has been developed and validated. Further, the dynamic behavior of the aneurysm has been analyzed over a heart cycle using {ECG}-gated {CTA}. To quantify this behavior, a combination of the previously developed segmentation method and {4D} registration was used. The results showed similar trend in aneurysm volume change as in arterial pulse wave and potential rupture areas on the aneurysm with large displacements were detected. This analysis provides additional information on the status of the aneurysmal wall AC/a,!A 1/2 which, together with other geometrical information, may help to better estimate aneurysm growth and predict rupture risk. Dynamic behavior was also investigated over a longer period of time to quantify growth and growth rate in a longitudinal {CTA} study. Again a combination of the previously developed segmentation method and groupwise registration was used. The method uses all the information from all follow-up scans simultaneously and gives better results than when performing measurements on each scan individually. This method can benefit the clinical diagnosis and treatment planning in the sense that the results are objective and quantitative. For future studies, further attention is to be paid more to the areas of automated aneurysms detection and bone masking in {CTA}. Fusing these two tools with the previously developed ones will make a big step forward in intracranial aneurysms diagnosis and treatment.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the clinical value of two novel molecular imaging techniques: (11)C-choline positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and ferumoxtran-10 enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance lymphography [MRL]) for lymph node (LN) treatment in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Therefore, we evaluated the ability of PET/CT and MRL to assess the number, size, and location of LN metastases in patients with primary or recurrent PCa. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 29 patients underwent MRL and PET/CT for LN evaluation. The MRL and PET/CT data were analyzed independently. The number, size, and location of the LN metastases were determined. The location was described as within or outside the standard clinical target volume for elective pelvic irradiation as defined by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Subsequently, the results from MRL and PET/CT were compared. RESULTS: Of the 738 LNs visible on MRL, 151 were positive in 23 of 29 patients. Of the 132 LNs visible on PET/CT, 34 were positive in 13 of 29 patients. MRL detected significantly more positive LNs (p < 0.001) in more patients than PET/CT (p = 0.002). The mean diameter of the detected suspicious LNs on MRL was significantly smaller than those detected by PET/CT, 4.9 mm and 8.4 mm, respectively (p < 0.0001). In 14 (61\%) of 23 patients, suspicious LNs were found outside the clinical target volume with MRL and in 4 (31\%) of 13 patients with PET/CT. CONCLUSION: In patients with PCa, both molecular imaging techniques, MRL and (11)C-choline PET/CT, can detect LNs suspicious for metastasis, irrespective of the existing size and shape criteria for CT and conventional magnetic resonance imaging. On MRL and PET/CT, 61\% and 31\% of the suspicious LNs were located outside the conventional clinical target volume. Therefore, these techniques could help to individualize treatment selection and enable image-guided radiotherapy for patients with PCa LN metastases.},

MATERIAL AND METHOD: MRI, dynamic MRI, and 1H-MR spectroscopic imaging were performed in 10 patients with prostate cancer on 1.5T and 3T whole-body scanners. Comparable scan protocols were used, and additional high-resolution measurements at 3T were acquired. For both field strengths the signal-to-noise ratio was calculated and image quality was assessed. RESULT: At 3T the signal-to-noise ratio improved. This resulted in increased spatial MRI resolution, which significantly improved anatomic detail. The increased spectral resolution improved the separation of individual resonances in MRSI. Contrast-enhanced time-concentration curves could be obtained with a doubled temporal resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Initial results of endorectal 3T 1H-MR spectroscopic imaging in prostate cancer patients showed potential advantages: the increase in spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution at higher field strength may result in an improved accuracy in delineating and staging prostate cancer.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is common in patients treated for breast cancer, especially in patients treated with systemic treatment and radiotherapy and in those with preexisting CVD risk factors. Coronary artery calcium (CAC), a strong independent CVD risk factor, can be automatically quantified on radiotherapy planning computed tomography (CT) scans and may help identify patients at increased CVD risk. To evaluate the association of CAC with CVD and coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with breast cancer. In this multicenter cohort study of 15915 patients with breast cancer receiving radiotherapy between 2005 and 2016 who were followed until December 31, 2018, age, calendar year, and treatment-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the association of CAC with CVD and CAD. Overall CAC scores were automatically extracted from planning CT scans using a deep learning algorithm. Patients were classified into Agatston risk categories (0, 1-10, 11-100, 101-399, >400 units). Occurrence of fatal and nonfatal CVD and CAD were obtained from national registries. Of the 15915 participants included in this study, the mean (SD) age at CT scan was 59.0 (11.2; range, 22-95) years, and 15879 (99.8%) were women. Seventy percent (n=11179) had no CAC. Coronary artery calcium scores of 1 to 10, 11 to 100, 101 to 400, and greater than 400 were present in 10.0% (n=1584), 11.5% (n=1825), 5.2% (n=830), and 3.1% (n=497) respectively. After a median follow-up of 51.2 months, CVD risks increased from 5.2% in patients with no CAC to 28.2% in patients with CAC scores higher than 400. After adjustment, CVD risk increased with higher CAC score. Coronary artery calcium was particularly strongly associated with CAD. The association between CAC and CVD was strongest in patients treated with anthracyclines and patients who received a radiation boost. This cohort study found that coronary artery calcium on breast cancer radiotherapy planning CT scan results was associated with CVD, especially CAD. Automated CAC scoring on radiotherapy planning CT scans may be used as a fast and low-cost tool to identify patients with breast cancer at increased risk of CVD, allowing implementing CVD risk-mitigating strategies with the aim to reduce the risk of CVD burden after breast cancer.},

We compared the performance of well-exposed conventional and digital portable chest radiographs in the detection of thin catheters and tested the influences of dose alterations. Portable chest radiographs of 20 patients were obtained with conventional film/screen (FR) and with storage phosphors at 50\% (SRL), 100\% (SRN), and 250\% (SRH) of the conventionally required exposure dose. The region of the mediastinum was subdivided into an average of 18 fields, 50\% of which were superimposed with thin catheter segments. ROC analysis of 11,600 observations by 8 readers found only SRH equivalent to FR in catheter visualisation. Performance decreased significantly with SRN and SRL. Detection of low contrast catheters was found to be significantly decreased in storage phosphor radiographs obtained with standard exposure dose. A dose reduction is not feasible with current equipment if performance equivalent to conventional radiography is to be achieved.},

Spiral scanning started at the level of the superior mesenteric artery with a delay of t + 5 seconds after the start of injection of 100-150 mL of contrast medium.Spiral CT angiography demonstrated multiple renal arteries in five patients. A renal artery stenosis or occlusion was found in 15 of 22 patients (22 of 54 arteries). All findings were confirmed with arterial DSA. Vessel contrast on spiral CT scans was good to excellent in 19 of 22 patients.

In addition, assessment of liver volume is necessary before segmental liver transplantation. Sonography or other cross-sectional imaging modalities are sufficient for these purposes. After transplantation, imaging is principally required in cases with suspected complications. Sonography, including Duplex and Doppler sonography, is an excellent first investigative modality for this purpose in addition to assessment of the clinical and biochemical parameters. Sonography can diagnose not only vascular complications but also biliary and infective complications; the former may also be a concealed cause of the latter. In unclear infections sonography often has to be supplemented by other modalities like CT. In equivocal cases a puncture is indicated. Invasive procedures are necessary in only selected cases, in particular when an intervention is under consideration. At present MR plays a limited role in the diagnostic workup as it rarely offers additional information except in very few cases. The early diagnosis of rejection cannot be reliably made by any of the imaging modalities and is essentially dependent on the biopsy.},

To that purpose, an acoustic model in Spanish have been developed to recognize voice commands with Julius. The model is user dependent and has been suited to the proposed set of commands to achieve a better recognition rate. One of the advantages of the proposed speech recognition mechanism is that it can be easily adapted to a new list of commands. A robot has been successfully teleoperated with voice.

This study presents a method to automatically measure shape changes of the trachea from paired inspiration and expiration computed tomography ({CT}) scans and investigates the influence on {COPD} {GOLD} stage classification. {METHOD AND MATERIALS} A database of 184 subjects well distributed over {GOLD} stages 0 to 4 who received inspiration {CT} (16x0.75mm, 120-140 {kVp}, 30-160 {mAs}), expiration {CT} (90 {kVp}, 20 {mAs}) and pulmonary function testing on the same day was constructed. We developed software to automatically extract the lungs, the trachea and the carina in all scans based on region growing and morphological processing. The shape of the trachea ({TS}) was encoded in axial sections by the length of eight equiangular rays cast from the center of gravity of the trachea. {TS} was computed in the inspiration scan in three axial slices 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 cm above the carina, and in corresponding expiration sections obtained using elastic registration based on B-spline deformations and mutual information on the slices from the inspiration scan. The inspiration and expiration features were concatenated and norrmalized by dividing by the length of the longest ray in the inspiration scan. In addition, an emphysema score ({ES}) was computed as the percentage of lung voxels below -950 {HU} in inspiration scans. The database was divided into a training set and a test set with equal size and distribution of {GOLD} stages. A linear discriminant classifier was trained to classify subjects into {GOLD} stage based on {ES}, {TS} or {ES}+{TS}. For the last two feature sets, Principal Component Analysis was applied to reduce the number of features. {RESULTS} The percentages of subjects correctly classified were 35%, 33% and 44% for the feature sets {ES}, {TS} and {ES}+{TS}. Thus, including tracheal shape features improved performance with 9 percentage points compared to using only an emphysema measure. Using {ES}+{TS} the percentage of subjects assigned to either the correct class or a class neighbouring the correct one was 80%. {CONCLUSION} Tracheal morphology changes can be extracted automatically from {CT} scans. Combining the proposed trachea shape features with emphysema score, classification into {GOLD} stages improved substantially. {CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION} Trachea morphology in inspiration and expiration scans can provide useful information for {GOLD} stage classification of {COPD}.},

Emphysema is quantified from chest computed tomography {(CT)} scans as the percentage of attentuation values below a fixed threshold. The emphysema quantification varies substantially between scans reconstructed with different kernels, limiting the possibilities to compare emphysema quantifications obtained from scans with different reconstruction parameters. In this paper we propose a method to normalize scans reconstructed with different kernels to have the same characteristics as scans reconstructed with a reference kernel and investigate if this normalization reduces the variability in emphysema quantification. The proposed normalization splits a {CT} scan into different frequency bands based on hierarchical unsharp masking. Normalization is performed by changing the energy in each frequency band to the average energy in each band in the reference kernel. A database of 15 subjects with {COPD} was constructed for this study. All subjects were scanned at total lung capacity and the scans were reconstructed with four different reconstruction kernels. The normalization was applied to all scans. Emphysema quantification was performed before and after normalization. It is shown that the emphysema score varies substantially before normalization but the variation diminishes after normalization.},

  title = {Relationship between Lung Function Parameters and {CT} Measurements of Emphysema, Airways, and Tracheal Collapse in Subjects with Mild {COPD}},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {PURPOSE. Excessive expiratory tracheal collapse may be related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the relationship between tracheal changes, CT measurements, and lung function is not very well known. This study aims to assess the correlation between pulmonary function tests (PFT) and CT measurements of emphysema, airways, and tracheal collapse in patients with and without COPD. METHOD AND MATERIALS. A database of 1032 male subjects who received inspiration CT (16x0.75mm, 120-140 kVp, 30-160 mAs), expiration CT (90 kVp, 20 mAs) and PFT on the same day was constructed. 389 participants (38%) had COPD, defined as ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) <70%. The number of patients per GOLD stage (0-3) was 643, 247, 122, 20. CT parameters assessed were tracheal collapsibility (TCo), defined as the highest ratio of cross-sectional area of the trachea in expiration and inspiration; emphysema score (ES), computed as the percentage of lung voxels below -950 HU in inspiration scans; air trapping (AT), defined as the ratio of mean lung density in expiration and inspiration; and square root of the wall area of a hypothetical airway of 10-mm internal perimeter of segmental and subsegmental airways (Pi10). Correlations were evaluated using the Spearman correlation coefficients and differences between normal and COPD subjects with a StudentsAC/a,!a,,C/ t-test. RESULTS. ES, Pi10 and AT correlated (p < 0.01) with FEV1 (r= -0.17, r= -0.53, r= -0.36) and FEV1/FVC (r=-0.48, r=-0.34, r=-0.51). TCo did not correlate with FEV1 (r= 0.01), but with FEV1/FVC (r=-0.14). Mean A,A+- standard deviation (SD) ES, Pi10, AT, and TCo in the no-COPD group were 0.82 A,A+- 0.98, 2.29 A,A+- 0.44, 81.57 A,A+- 5.76, and 0.67 A,A+- 0.13. Mean A,A+- SD ES, Pi10, AT, and TCo in the COPD group were 2.80 A,A+- 4.04, 2.65 A,A+- 0.55, 87.18 A,A+- 4.93, and 0.7 A,A+- 0.14. These values were significantly different between both groups ( p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION. ES, Pi10, and AT are significantly different between normal and COPD subjects and are correlated to PFT. TCo is also significantly different between normal and COPD subjects but does not show a strong correlation with PFT. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION. Emphysema, tracheal collapse, and airway morpholgy obtained from chest CT data may be used to discriminate between normal and mild COPD subjects.},

Normalization was performed by frequency band decomposition with hierarchical unsharp masking to standardize the energy in each band to a reference value. Emphysema scores (ES), the percentage of lung voxels below -950 HU, were computed before and after normalization. Bland-Altman analysis and correlation between ES and spirometry before and after normalization were compared.

AC/a,!AC/ Normalization allows comparison of emphysema quantification from images reconstructed with varying kernels. AC/a,!AC/ Normalization allows comparison of emphysema quantification obtained with scanners from different manufacturers.

  abstract = {To present a method to automatically quantify tracheal morphology changes during breathing and investigate its contribution to airflow impairment when adding CT measures of emphysema, airway wall thickness, air trapping and ventilation. Because tracheal abnormalities often occur localized, a method is presented that automatically determines the most abnormal trachea section based on automatically computed sagittal and coronal lengths. In this most abnormal section, trachea morphology is encoded using four equiangular rays from the center of the trachea and the normalized lengths of these rays are used as features in a classification scheme. Consequently, trachea measurements are used as input for classification into GOLD stages in addition to emphysema, air trapping and ventilation. A database of 200 subjects distributed across all GOLD stages is used to evaluate the classification with a k nearest neighbour algorithm. Performance is assessed in two experimental settings: (a) when only inspiratory scans are taken; (b) when both inspiratory and expiratory scans are available. Given only an inspiratory CT scan, measuring tracheal shape provides complementary information only to emphysema measurements. The best performing set in the inspiratory setting was a combination of emphysema and bronchial measurements. The best performing feature set in the inspiratory-expiratory setting includes measurements of emphysema, ventilation, air trapping, and trachea. Inspiratory and inspiratory-expiratory settings showed similar performance. The fully automated system presented in this study provides information on trachea shape at inspiratory and expiratory CT. Addition of tracheal morphology features improves the ability of emphysema and air trapping CT-derived measurements to classify COPD patients into GOLD stages and may be relevant when investigating different aspects of COPD.},

Emphysema scores were computed in the original scans (origES) and after applying resampling, normalization and bullae analysis (normES). We compared the prognostic value of normES versus origES for lung cancer and all-cause mortality by computing the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and the net reclassification improvement (NRI) for follow-up times of 1-7 years. normES was a better predictor of mortality than origES. The 95% confidence intervals for the differences in AUC values indicated a significant difference for all-cause mortality for 2 through 6 years of follow-up, and for lung cancer mortality for 1 through 7 years of follow-up. 95% confidence intervals in NRI values showed a statistically significant improvement in classification for all-cause mortality for 2 through 7 years of follow-up, and for lung cancer mortality for 3 through 7 years of follow-up. Contrary to conventional emphysema score, our normalized emphysema score is a good predictor of all-cause and lung cancer mortality in settings where multiple CT scanners and protocols are used.},

  abstract = {{RATIONALE} {P}atients with emphysema are investigated for minimally invasive occlusive endobronchial treatment as an alternative to lung volume reduction surgery ({LVRS}). Presence of collateral flow through incomplete pulmonary fissure may affect the treatment outcome. {P}revious research has shown that visual fissure integrity score is associated with lobar collapse. {T}he purpose of this study is to evaluate if an automatic quantitative fissural integrity score from chest {CT} scans is predictive of achieving lobe volume reduction in patients with severe emphysema treated with minimally invasive treatment. {METHODS} {B}aseline and post treatment follow up {CT} scans from 18 subjects treated with occlusive endobronchial treatment were selected from an anonymized image database. {CT} imaging of the lung was performed at suspended total lung capacity with 1.25 mm slice thickness, 1mm slice spacing, at 120 {KV} and 90 m{A}s. The target lobe for lobar volume reduction was selected as the lobe with the most severe emphysema. {Q}uantification of lobar volumes was performed using in-house developed software that segments the lungs and lobes. {T}he differences between lobar volumes at the baseline and follow up were calculated. {I}n the baseline scans, fissures were automatically segmented and the fissural integrity was quantified as the percentage of the lobar border defined by a fissure. {T}he association between automatically computed fissure integrity percentage at baseline and lobar volume reduction at follow up was assessed using spearman rank test. {T}he odds of complete lobar collapse (volume change of more than 85%) in subjects with complete fissures (integrity percentage more than 90%) was assessed using logistic model. {RESULTS} {T}he correlation between fissure integrity percentage and percentage lobar collapse was 0.53 (p=0.023). The odds ratio of complete lobar collapse was 2.4 times higher for subjects with complete fissure than with incomplete fissure (p=0.035). {CONCLUSION} {A}n automated system to both detect and assess fissure integrity correlated with lobar volume reduction post endoluminal occlusion techniques. {A}dvantages of automatic fissural completeness quantification over visual assessment are robustness, precision, and time consumption.},

To solve this problem, the accurate knowledge about internal and external factors of the breast, such as internal tissues distribution, is needed for modelling a suitable physical behavior. In this work, we compare four different tissue segmentation algorithms, two intensity-based segmentation algorithms (Fuzzy C-means and Gaussian mixture model) and two improvements that incorporate spatial information (Kernelized Fuzzy C-means and Markov Random Fields, respectively), and analyze their effect to the multi-modal registration. The overall framework consists on using a density estimation software (VolparaTM) to extract the glandular tissue from full-field digital mammograms, meanwhile, a biomechanical model is used to mimic the mammographic acquisition from the MRI, computing the glandular tissue traversed by the X-ray beam. Results with 40 patients show a high agreement between the amount of glandular tissue computed for each method.},

  abstract = {Purpose:Tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) serves as an independent prognostic factor in colorectal cancer and other solid malignancies. The recent introduction of digital pathology in routine tissue diagnostics holds opportunities for automated TSR analysis. We investigated the potential of computer-aided quantification of intratumoral stroma in rectal cancer whole-slide images. Methods: Histological slides from 129 rectal adenocarcinoma patients were analyzed by two experts who selected a suitable stroma hot-spot and visually assessed TSR. A semi-automatic method based on deep learning was trained to segment all relevant tissue types in rectal cancer histology and subsequently applied to the hot-spots provided by the experts. Patients were assigned to a 'stroma-high' or 'stroma-low' group by both TSR methods (visual and automated). This allowed for prognostic comparison between the two methods in terms of disease-specific and disease-free survival times. Results: With stroma-low as baseline, automated TSR was found to be prognostic independent of age, gender, pT-stage, lymph node status, tumor grade, and whether adjuvant therapy was given, both for disease-specific survival (hazard ratio = 2.48 (95% confidence interval 1.29-4.78)) and for disease-free survival (hazard ratio = 2.05 (95% confidence interval 1.11-3.78)). Visually assessed TSR did not serve as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: This work shows that TSR is an independent prognosticator in rectal cancer when assessed automatically in user-provided stroma hot-spots. The deep learning-based technology presented here may be a significant aid to pathologists in routine diagnostics.},

  abstract = {Assessment of immunohistochemically stained slides is often a crucial diagnostic step in clinical practice. However, as this assessment is generally performed visually by pathologists it can suffer from signi?cant inter-observer variability. The introduction of whole slide scanners facilitates automated analysis of immunohistochemical slides. Color deconvolution (CD) is one of the most popular ?rst steps in quantifying stain density in histopathological images. However, color deconvolution requires stain color vectors for accurate unmixing. Often it is assumed that these stain vectors are static. In practice, however, they are influenced by many factors. This can cause inferior CD unmixing and thus typically results in poor quanti?cation. Some automated methods exist for color stain vector estimation, but most depend on a signi?cant amount of each stain to be present in the whole slide images. In this paper we propose a method for automatically ?nding stain color vectors and unmixing IHC stained whole slide images, even when some stains are sparsely expressed. We collected 16 tonsil slides and stained them for different periods of time with hematoxylin and a DAB-colored proliferation marker Ki67. RGB pixels of WSI images were converted to the hue saturation density (HSD) color domain and subsequently K-means clustering was used to separate stains and calculate the stain color vectors for each slide. Our results show that staining time affects the stain vectors and that calculating a unique stain vector for each slide results in better unmixing results than using a standard stain vector.},

  title = {Tumor segmentation in fluorescent TNBC immunohistochemical multiplex images using deep learning},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Breast cancer is among females the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death. A subtype of breast cancer called triple negative breast cancer(TNBC) is known to be more aggressive, generally occur at younger age and even very small (<1cm) node-negative TNBC show recurrence within 5 years in 15% of cases if left untreated. For TNBC, several studies showed that the number of tumor-in?ltraing lymphocytes (TIL) in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections strongly correlates with disease free survival. Subtyping of lymphocytes could strongly help ?nding more powerful prognostic markers. However, standard H&E stained sections do not permit speci?c subtyping of lymphocytes and immunohistochemistry(IHC) allows very limited subtyping. New scanning systems, staining protocols and medical imaging analysis algorithms allows to gather spatial information of lymphocyte subtypes and to determine subtype positioning of lymfocytes in peri- or intertumoral regions. A ?rst step towards this goal is to detect tumor regions to determine whether a lymfocyte is positioned perior intertumoral. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to investigate the performance of convolutional networks to segment tumor regions in TNBC whole-slide multiplex IHC slides. Multiple experiments were conducted to investigate and maximize the performance. The data used for training was investigated and it was concluded that training a FCNN (fully convolutional neural network) using the DAPI and CK8-18 data channels together with a resolution of 0.96 um/pix and patch size of 128x128 resulted in the highest segmentation performance. Enriching the dataset with hard mining had no positive effects on the performance. Using the different architecture U-net resulted in similar results compared to that of a FCNN. A 'model averaging ensemble' resulted in the highest segmentation performance with a F1 score of 0.83. It can be concluded that fully convolutional networks were able to segment tumor regions in triple negative and holds true for both FCNN and U-net architectures and can be used for the overarching aim of this research, namely extracting powerful prognostic information from intra- and peritumoral lymphocyte},

These systems would be ready to be applied in different fields such as medicine, controller robots and social life. Reinforcement learning is an attractive area of machine learning which addresses these concerns. In large scales, learning performance of an agent can be improved by using hierarchical Reinforcement Learning techniques and temporary extended actions. The higher level of abstraction helps the learning agent approach lifelong learning goals. In this paper a new method is presented for discovering subgoal states and constructing useful skills. The method utilizes Ant System optimization algorithm to identify bottleneck edges, which act like bridges between different connected areas of the problem space. Using discovered subgoals, the agent creates temporal abstractions, which enable it to explore more effectively. Experimental Results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the learning performance of the agent.},

  abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a common finding on magnetic resonance images of elderly people. White matter lesions (WML) are important markers for not only the small vessel disease, but also neuro-degenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis, AlzheimerAC/a,!a,,C/s disease and vascular dementia. Volumetric measurements such as the AC/a,!A"total lesion loadA-A?A 1/2 ?, have been studied and related to these diseases. With respect to SVD we conjecture that small lesions are important, as they have been observed to grow over time and they form the majority of lesions in number. To study these small lesions they need to be annotated, which is a complex and time-consuming task. Existing (semi)automatic methods have been aimed at volumetric measurements and large lesions, and are not suitable for the detection of small lesions. In this research we established a supervised voxel classification CAD system, optimized and trained to exclusively detect small WMLs. To achieve this, several preprocessing steps were taken, which included a robust standardization of subject intensities to reduce inter-subject intensity variability as much as possible. A number of features that were found to be well identifying small lesions were calculated including multimodal intensities, tissue probabilities, several features for accurate location description, a number of second order derivative features as well as multi-scale annular filter for blobness detection. Only small lesions were used to learn the target concept via Adaboost using random forests as its basic classifiers. Finally the results were evaluated using Free-response receiver operating characteristic.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been widely used for visual recognition tasks including semantic segmentation of images. While the existing methods consider uniformly sampled single- or multi-scale patches from the neighborhood of each voxel, this approach might be sub-optimal as it captures and processes unnecessary details far away from the center of the patch. We instead propose to train CNNs with non-uniformly sampled patches that allow a wider extent for the sampled patches. This results in more captured contextual information, which is in particular of interest for biomedical image analysis, where the anatomical location of imaging features are often crucial. We evaluate and compare this strategy for white matter hyperintensity segmentation on a test set of 46 MRI scans. We show that the proposed method not only outperforms identical CNNs with uniform patches of the same size (0.780 Dice coefficient compared to 0.736), but also gets very close to the performance of an independent human expert (0.796 Dice coefficient)},

  abstract = {Purpose:
                             White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are seen on FLAIR-MRI in several neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, dementia, Parkinsonism, stroke and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). WMHs are often used as biomarkers for prognosis or disease progression in these diseases, and additionally longitudinal quantification of WMHs is used to evaluate therapeutic strategies. Human readers show considerable disagreement and inconsistency on detection of small lesions. A multitude of automated detection algorithms for WMHs exists, but since most of the current automated approaches are tuned to optimize segmentation performance according to Jaccard or Dice scores, smaller WMHs often go undetected in these approaches. In this paper, the authors propose a method to accurately detect all WMHs, large as well as small.

                             Methods:
                             A two-stage learning approach was used to discriminate WMHs from normal brain tissue. Since small and larger WMHs have quite a different appearance, the authors have trained two probabilistic classifiers: one for the small WMHs (<3 mm effective diameter) and one for the larger WMHs (>3 mm in-plane effective diameter). For each size-specific classifier, an Adaboost is trained for five iterations, with random forests as the basic classifier. The feature sets consist of 22 features including intensities, location information, blob detectors, and second order derivatives. The outcomes of the two first-stage classifiers were combined into a single WMH likelihood by a second-stage classifier. Their method was trained and evaluated on a dataset with MRI scans of 362 SVD patients (312 subjects for training and validation annotated by one and 50 for testing annotated by two trained raters). To analyze performance on the separate test set, the authors performed a free-response receiving operating characteristic (FROC) analysis, instead of using segmentation based methods that tend to ignore the contribution of small WMHs.

                             Results:
                             Experimental results based on FROC analysis demonstrated a close performance of the proposed computer aided detection (CAD) system to human readers. While an independent reader had 0.78 sensitivity with 28 false positives per volume on average, their proposed CAD system reaches a sensitivity of 0.73 with the same number of false positives.

                             Conclusions:
                             The authors have developed a CAD system with all its ingredients being optimized for a better detection of WMHs of all size, which shows performance close to an independent reader.},

  abstract = {Lacunes of presumed vascular origin (lacunes) are associated with an increased risk of stroke, gait impairment, and dementia and are a primary imaging feature of the small vessel disease. Quantification of lacunes may be of great importance to elucidate the mechanisms behind neuro-degenerative disorders and is recommended as part of study standards for small vessel disease research. However, due to the different appearance of lacunes in various brain regions and the existence of other similar-looking structures, such as perivascular spaces, manual annotation is a difficult, elaborative and subjective task, which can potentially be greatly improved by reliable and consistent computer-aided detection (CAD) routines. In this paper, we propose an automated two-stage method using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). We show that this method has good performance and can considerably benefit readers. We first use a fully convolutional neural network to detect initial candidates. In the second step, we employ a 3D CNN as a false positive reduction tool. As the location information is important to the analysis of candidate structures, we further equip the network with contextual information using multi-scale analysis and integration of explicit location features. We trained, validated and tested our networks on a large dataset of 1075 cases obtained from two different studies. Subsequently, we conducted an observer study with four trained observers and compared our method with them using a free-response operating characteristic analysis. Shown on a test set of 111 cases, the resulting CAD system exhibits performance similar to the trained human observers and achieves a sensitivity of 0.974 with 0.13 false positives per slice. A feasibility study also showed that a trained human observer would considerably benefit once aided by the CAD system.},

  abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used in routine clinical diagnosis and treatment. However, variations in MRI acquisition protocols result in different appearances of normal and diseased tissue in the images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have shown to be successful in many medical image analysis tasks, are typically sensitive to the variations in imaging protocols. Therefore, in many cases, networks trained on data acquired with one MRI protocol, do not perform satisfactorily on data acquired with different protocols. This limits the use of models trained with large annotated legacy datasets on a new dataset with a different domain which is often a recurring situation in clinical settings. In this study, we aim to answer the following central questions regarding domain adaptation in medical image analysis: Given a fitted legacy model, 1) How much data from the new domain is required for a decent adaptation of the original network?; and, 2) What portion of the pre-trained model parameters should be retrained given a certain number of the new domain training samples? To address these questions, we conducted extensive experiments in white matter hyperintensity segmentation task. We trained a CNN on legacy MR images of brain and evaluated the performance of the domain-adapted network on the same task with images from a different domain. We then compared the performance of the model to the surrogate scenarios where either the same trained network is used or a new network is trained from scratch on the new dataset.The domain-adapted network tuned only by two training examples achieved a Dice score of 0.63 substantially outperforming a similar network trained on the same set of examples from scratch.},

  abstract = {The anatomical location of imaging features is of crucial importance for accurate diagnosis in many medical tasks. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have had huge successes in computer vision, but they lack the natural ability to incorporate the anatomical location in their decision making process, hindering success in some medical image analysis tasks. In this paper, to integrate the anatomical location information into the network, we propose several deep CNN architectures that consider multi-scale patches or take explicit location features while training. We apply and compare the proposed architectures for segmentation of white matter hyperintensities in brain MR images on a large dataset. As a result, we observe that the CNNs that incorporate location information substantially outperform a conventional segmentation method with handcrafted features as well as CNNs that do not integrate location information. On a test set of 50 scans, the best configuration of our networks obtained a Dice score of 0.792, compared to 0.805 for an independent human observer. Performance levels of the machine and the independent human observer were not statistically significantly different (p-value = 0.06).},

  abstract = {Ventricular volume and its progression are known to be linked to several brain diseases such as dementia and schizophrenia. Therefore accurate measurement of ventricle volume is vital for longitudinal studies on these disorders, making automated ventricle segmentation algorithms desirable. In the past few years, deep neural networks have shown to outperform the classical models in many imaging domains. However, the success of deep networks is dependent on manually labeled data sets, which are expensive to acquire especially for higher dimensional data in the medical domain. In this work, we show that deep neural networks can be trained on muchcheaper-to-acquire pseudo-labels (e.g., generated by other automated less accurate methods) and still produce more accurate segmentations compared to the quality of the labels. To show this, we use noisy segmentation labels generated by a conventional region growing algorithm to train a deep network for lateral ventricle segmentation. Then on a large manually annotated test set, we show that the network significantly outperforms the conventional region growing algorithm which was used to produce the training labels for the network. Our experiments report a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.874 for the trained network compared to 0.754 for the conventional region growing algorithm (p < 0.001).},

  abstract = {Segmentation algorithms are typically evaluated by comparison to an accepted reference standard. The cost of generating accurate reference standards for medical image segmentation can be substantial. Since the study cost and the likelihood of detecting a clinically meaningful difference in accuracy both depend on the size and on the quality of the study reference standard, balancing these trade-offs supports the efficient use of research resources.

                             In this work, we derive a statistical power calculation that enables researchers to estimate the appropriate sample size to detect clinically meaningful differences in segmentation accuracy (i.e. the proportion of voxels matching the reference standard) between two algorithms. Furthermore, we derive a formula to relate reference standard errors to their effect on the sample sizes of studies using lower-quality (but potentially more affordable and practically available) reference standards.

                             The accuracy of the derived sample size formula was estimated through Monte Carlo simulation, demonstrating, with 95% confidence, a predicted statistical power within 4% of simulated values across a range of model parameters. This corresponds to sample size errors of less than 4 subjects and errors in the detectable accuracy difference less than 0.6%. The applicability of the formula to real-world data was assessed using bootstrap resampling simulations for pairs of algorithms from the PROMISE12 prostate MR segmentation challenge data set. The model predicted the simulated power for the majority of algorithm pairs within 4% for simulated experiments using a high-quality reference standard and within 6% for simulated experiments using a low-quality reference standard. A case study, also based on the PROMISE12 data, illustrates using the formulae to evaluate whether to use a lower-quality reference standard in a prostate segmentation study.},

  abstract = {Deep-learning-based segmentation tools have yielded higher reported segmentation accuracies for many medical imaging applications. However, inter-site variability in image properties can challenge the translation of these tools to data from 'unseen' sites not included in the training data. This study quantifies the impact of inter-site variability on the accuracy of deep-learning-based segmentations of the prostate from magnetic resonance (MR) images, and evaluates two strategies for mitigating the reduced accuracy for data from unseen sites: training on multi-site data and training with limited additional data from the unseen site. Using 376 T2-weighted prostate MR images from six sites, we compare the segmentation accuracy (Dice score and boundary distance) of
                             three deep-learning-based networks trained on data from a single site and on various configurations of data from multiple sites. We found that the segmentation accuracy of a single-site network was substantially worse on data from unseen sites than on data from the training site. Training on multi-site data yielded marginally improved accuracy and robustness. However, including as few as 8 subjects from the unseen site, e.g. during commissioning of a new clinical system, yielded substantial improvement (regaining 75% of the difference in Dice score).},

  abstract = {In areas with a high intrinsic contrast such as the chest, radiation dose can be reduced for specific indications. Low dose chest CT is feasible and cannot only be applied for lung cancer screening, but also in daily routine and for early detection of lung destruction. We showed in a small sample of patients from the outpatient department of pulmonology that ultralow-dose CT is feasible and can provide more information than CXR in two directions, while radiation dose is similar. The main disadvantage of radiation dose reduction is the accompanying increase in image noise. The detection of abnormalities with a high contrast to the surrounding normal tissue is not limited by the amount of image noise on the CT scans performed with the current minimum radiation dose. However, when the structure of interest shows a low contrast to the surrounding normal tissue, image noise can hamper the detection and especially the automated size measurement of the abnormality. We demonstrated that an increase in image noise results in overestimation of the emphysema score compared to standard dose CT, but also that the application of a dedicated noise reduction filter to the reconstructed data before the automated quantification of emphysema can prevent this overestimations. This thesis is partly based on the Dutch Belgian Lung Cancer Screening project (NELSON), a randomized multi-center trial studying current and former smokers in order to detect lung cancer in an early, treatable stage. The detection of growth is the main feature to distinguish benign non-calcified nodules from potentially benign ones, but interscan and to a lesser extent interobserver variability can limit the detection of growth. We showed that the performance of the algorithm to segment the nodule completely was the most important factor contributing to the variability. Since chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer share smoking as main risk factor, lung cancer screening trials provide a good opportunity to study the early stages and natural progression of COPD. Emphysema can cause COPD and can easily be detected and automated be quantified on CT by highlighting voxels with an abnormally low X-ray attenuation. We provided the limits of agreement for three common attenuation thresholds for emphysema scores obtained in a lung cancer screening setting. Moreover, we studied the prevalence of emphysema and airflow impairment in participants of the NELSON-project. Many participants showed destructed parenchyma, but a preserved lung function. However, the gas exchange is often already impaired in these subjects, but gas exchange is not one of the hallmarks of COPD (yet). The diffusion of DNO is shown to be a marker of vascular changes, which can precede macroscopic lung tissue destruction. We showed that DNO can be impaired before CT can detect emphysema. Furthermore, we showed that the distribution pattern of emphysema has an impact on the extent of airflow impairment. Current and former smokers with an apical predominance of emphysema showed more severe airflow limitation than subjects with an equal emphysema score, but a basal predominance of lung destruction.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2006},
  pages = {598},
  abstract = {Purpose: Around a third of pulmonary nodules detected with CT lung cancer screening programs are perifissural opacities (PFOs). These nodules are flattened and attached to a pulmonary fissure and represent benign findings. A computer-aided diagnosis system is presented that automatically determines if a nodule is a PFO. Method: Data was obtained from a lung cancer screening program with low dose multidetector CT (Philips Mx8000IDT, 16 x 0.75 mm collimation, 30 mAs). Only nodules with a volume between 50 and 500 mm3 were considered. Scans from 221 patients containing at least one such nodule were randomly selected, resulting in a set of 284 nodules. A radiologist determined which of these findings represented PFOs. Around each nodule a volume of interest (VOI) of 60 x 60 x 60 mm was extracted. An automatic algorithm segmented all nodules. Another automatic algorithm detected voxels belonging to fissures in the VOI, using a plate detector based on density values and the directions of principal curvature and a grouping algorithm to remove false isolated responses. Hough transforms were applied to the fissure voxels and the nodule boundary voxels to determine if the nodule had a flattened side that coincided with an attached fissure. From this analysis a number of numerical features were extracted. In addition, a number of features describing the shape of the nodule were computed. A Parzen density classifier was used to infer the probability that a nodule was a PFO from these features. Cross validation was used to train and test the system. Results: From the 284 nodules, 99 (35%) were identified as PFOs by the radiologist. The system obtained an area under the ROC curve of 0.80. It could detect 40% of all PFOs without any false positive finding and 65% at 95% specificity. PFOs that were not well detected were usually attached to fissures that were barely visible in the low dose data. Conclusion: Computer-aided diagnosis can be used to identify a large amount of benign nodules from chest CT data. This can be used in the work-up of patients with pulmonary nodules and may prevent unnecessary repeat examinations.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE We hypothesize that in some patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease reveals itself in thoracic CT scans not only through the presence of emphysematous regions but also as visible changes in airway morphology. This study relates automatically extracted measures of airway morphology to lung function impairment in heavy smokers. METHOD AND MATERIALS As part of a lung cancer screening trial, 508 male current and former heavy smokers underwent low-dose CT (16x0.75mm, 120-140 kVp, 30 mAs) at full inspiration, ultra low-dose CT (90 kVp, 20 mAs) at full expiration and pulmonary function testing on the same day. In house developed software extracted and labeled the bronchial tree in both inspiration and expiration scans automatically. In each scan, the total number of extracted airway branches per generation, their lengths and average diameters were computed for the 32 central bronchi individually (up to the segmental level) and for the peripheral bronchi (beyond this level and up to 16th bronchial generation) pooled per generation. Ratios between measurements at inspiration and expiration were determined as well. Linear discriminant analysis was used to detect lung function impairment (defined as FEV1/FVC<0.7) from these airway measurements. Results are reported as sensitivity at a specificity level of 90%. RESULTS Lung function impairment was seen in 181 individuals (36%). It was mild (FEV1 > 80% of predicted value) in 61% and severe (FEV1 < 50%) in less than 7% of these cases. The linear discriminate analysis using all automated airway measurements was able to identify 47% of these 181 individuals. Sensitivity dropped to 40% and 20%, respectively if only measurements from inspiration or expirations scans were used. When only central or peripheral airways were evaluated, sensitivity was reduced to 36% and 38%, respectively. CONCLUSION A substantial percentage of heavy smokers with mildly impaired lung function display abnormal airway morphology that can be detected automatically from CT data. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION The results contribute to the knowledge about COPD. Quantitative measures of airway morphology, automatically extracted from CT data, may become a biomarker for severity and progression of COPD.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {PURPOSE To develop and validate a robust technique for automatic extraction and labeling of the airway tree from thoracic CT scans. METHOD AND MATERIALS Three sets of 50 scans were used. For set 1, 50 heavy smokers underwent low-dose CT (16x0.75mm, 30 mAs, 120-140 kVp, full inspiration) for a lung cancer screening trial. For set 2, the same 50 subjects were scanned again in full expiration at ultra low-dose (20 mAs, 90 kVp). Set 3 comprised 50 scans, many including gross pulmonary opacifications, from patients with interstitial lung disease. These were acquired at clinical dose (120-170 mAs, 120 kVp), in full inspiration, with and without contrast material. The method starts in the trachea to grow the airways, using locally adaptive criteria for accepting voxels as part of a bronchus. While growing, the branch centerline, orientation and diameter are tracked and bifurcations are detected. A rule set based on diameter and orientation of the current segment and its parent determines if a potential segment is accepted, or discarded as leakage. When extraction is completed, the 32 central bronchi are labeled automatically based on parent-child relationships. Incorrect segments were visually identified. The number, generation and total length of extracted airways was evaluated. RESULTS The method required around 20 seconds of computation time and segmentations contained almost no false positive segments (<1%). In Set 1 and 3 on average 166 and 174 branches were extracted with an average total length of 2183 and 1949 mm. For the noisy expiration data in Set 2 this was substantially less: 59 segments and 789 mm. After the 6th generation, on average less segments were extracted but usually the tree included some segments up to the 10th generation. Central bronchi were found in 93% of all cases. CONCLUSION Fast and automatic extraction of airway tree including most central bronchi and many peripheral bronchi is feasible in inspiration CT scans, but challenging in expiration data. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Quantitative descriptors of airway morphology are essential to measure progression of lung diseases such as COPD, asthma, CF, ILD. This requires robust automatic extraction of the airway tree.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE In COPD patients, airflow obstruction can be caused by emphysema and/or small airways disease, leading to air trapping. We quantified both underlying causes of COPD from lobar analysis of paired inspiration-expiration CT scans. METHOD AND MATERIALS A database was collected of 231 patients and heavy smokers with GOLD stages 0 (at risk) to 4 who received volumetric inspiration CT (16x0.75mm, 120-140 kVp, 30-160 mAs), ultra low dose volumetric expiration CT (90 kVp, 20 mAs) and pulmonary function testing on the same day. In house developed software automatically extracted the five pulmonary lobes in all scans. Cases where segmentation failed in one scan in a pair were excluded. As a measure for emphysema, the percentages of lobar volume below -950 HU were computed in inspiration scans (IN-950). As a quantification of either emphysema or air-trapping, the percentages of lobar volume below -850 HU were computed in expiration scans (EX-850). A lobe was considered to be affected by emphysema if IN-950 was larger than the 95th percentile for that lobe in GOLD 0 subjects. Otherwise, the lobe was considered to be affected by air-trapping if EX-850 was larger than the 95th percentile for that lobe in GOLD 0 subjects. Otherwise, the lobe was considered normal. If four or five lobes were affected by emphysema, airtrapping or were normal, that subject was classified as emphysema dominant (ED), air trapping dominant (ATD) or normal; otherwise, the COPD phenotype was considered 'mixed'. RESULTS 213 pairs were available for analysis with GOLD stages 0-4: 49, 49, 50, 40, 25, respectively. The occurrence of normal, ED, ATD and mixed phenotypes for GOLD 0 subjects was 98%, 2% 0%, and 6%. For GOLD 1: 69%, 4%, 0%, 27%. For GOLD 2: 36%, 20%, 14%, 30%. For GOLD 3: 5%, 47%, 15%, 33%. For GOLD 4: 0%, 84%, 4%, 12%. CONCLUSION Lobar analysis of inspiration and expiration CT scan revealed different patterns in COPD patients. For the lower GOLD stages (1-3), a substantial subgroup of COPD patients have predominantly small airway disease, and a mixed pattern with emphysema and air trapping affecting different lobes is also a common finding. COPD patients in GOLD category 4 usually have four or all lobes affected by emphysema. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION This study indicates that the combination of inspiration and expiration CT can be used to identify COPD patients with predominantly small airway disease, for whom drug treatment could be effective.},

The authors review the principles of CAD for lesion detection and for quantification and illustrate the state-of-the-art with various examples. The requirements that radiologists have for CAD are discussed: sufficient performance, no increase in reading time, seamless workflow integration, regulatory approval, and cost efficiency. Performance is still the major bottleneck for many CAD systems. Novel ways of using CAD, extending the traditional paradigm of displaying markers for a second look, may be the key to using the technology effectively. The most promising strategy to improve CAD is the creation of publicly available databases for training and validation. This can identify the most fruitful new research directions, and provide a platform to combine multiple approaches for a single task to create superior algorithms. A-A?A 1/2  RSNA, 2011.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: Chest radiography is an important diagnostic test for the detection of tuberculosis (TB) but there are not enough experts to read chest radiographs (CXRs) in high burden countries. We compared the reading performance of inexperienced observers with and without the support of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system with that of an experienced reader. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A set of 100 digital CXRs (Oldelca DR, Delft Imaging Systems, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) of TB suspects was collected from two sites in Sub-Saharan Africa. Sputum culture was used as the reference standard. All cases were scored on a scale of 0 to 100 for the presence of active TB by seven non-experts (undergraduate medical students) and one expert CRRS certified reader for reading CXRs for TB. Prior to reading, the non-experts received one hour of general instruction from a thoracic radiologist and one hour of case reading training with another CRRS certified reader. Cases were also processed by a CAD system (CAD4TB, version 1.08, Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Scores of human readers and CAD were independently combined by averaging. Performance was evaluated as area under the ROC curve (Az), multi-reader-multi-case (MRMC) analysis was used to compare performance with and without CAD and pairwise comparisons were made with bootstrap estimation. p<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The data set contained 56 negative and 44 positive cases. The expert reader scored Az = 0.84. The non-experts scored on average Az = 0.80, range 0.69-0.86. CAD standalone scored Az = 0.82. With CAD, all readers improved performance (Az = 0.85 for the expert, for non-experts average Az = 0.82, range 0.73-0.87). For four out of seven non-experts, the increase was significant and MRMC indicated an overall significant increase in performance for reading with CAD. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic performance of non-experts for detection of active TB on digital CXRs is good and similar to that of an expert. Support from CAD further improves performance. Digital chest radiography with reading of non-experts with little training can be used for active TB case finding at reasonable sensitivity with very high specificity, or as a first line test with high sensitivity and reasonable specificity. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: Digital chest radiography and reading by inexperienced readers supported by CAD can be a fast, simple and low-cost point-of-care diagnostic for TB.},

  title = {{CIRRUS} {L}ung: an optimized workflow for quantitative image analysis of thoracic computed tomography and chest radiography for major pulmonary diseases: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and tuberculosis},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND Lung diseases are among the most deadly disorders: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}), a devastating disease with 12 million people in the United States currently diagnosed, ranks #3 on the list of causes of death wordwide. Lung cancer, by far the most common and most deadly cancer in men and women worldwide, ranks #5. Tuberculosis ({TB}), despite the availability of a cheap and effective cure, ranks #10. Imaging is crucially important for early detection, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment planning of {COPD}, lung cancer and {TB}. Chest radiography and computed tomography are the most important imaging modalities for the lung. METHODOLOGY/APPLICATION We present a flexible workstation for a quick and effective extraction of quantitative imaging parameters related to {COPD}, lung cancer and {TB}. The workstation loads an arbitrary number of {CT} and chest radiography studies of each subject simultaneously, allowing the user to instantly track the evolution of any lesion. Each {CT} scan is elastically registered to all prior {CT} scans of the same subject. Findings in prior scans have been automatically propagated and linked to findings in the current scan. All scans and processing results are preloaded in the background to ensure rapid reading. The {CIRRUS} {L}ung workstation has been developed jointly by the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen The Netherlands, and Fraunhofer MEVIS, Bremen, Germany. It is based on the MeVisLab software platform. The workstation is available through research collaboration agreements and in active use in a variety of projects . {CIRRUS} {L}ung has a number of modes that will be demonstrated: 1) High throughput lung screening. Scan quality is automatically assessed; data with low quality, artifacts or underlying interstitial lung disease are flagged. High sensitivity computerized detection (CAD) of solid nodules and sub-solid nodules is included. High throughput reading with CAD as a first reader is supported. Each nodule is automatically characterized as solid, part-solid, non-solid, or benign (calcified lesions, perifissural lymph nodes). Volumetry, volume growth rate, mass and mass growth rate are automatically computed with advanced segmentation algorithms that have can handle sub-solid lesions and segment the solid core of part-solid nodules. Findings are summarized in a structured report. Follow-up recommendation according to Fleischner guidelines are included. 2) Clinical oncology work-up. This mode is similar to the screening mode, but includes completely automatic generation of {RECIST} workup. 3) Chest radiography lung screening. Chest radiographs can be annotated and viewed with various tools such as bone suppression and gray scale inversion. Computer-aided detection and interactive CAD reading are supported. 4) {COPD} quantification. Elastic registration between inspiration and expiration scans has been precomputed and allows for linked scrolling. Lungs, lobes, airways, fissures, and segments are automatically segmented for regional functional analysis. In case the user is not satisfied with the segmentation results, (s)he can quickly correct these with an intuitive interactive correction method. {CT} image standardization is included using a precomputed dedicated energy correction algorithm that makes quantifications less dependent on scan protocol (scanner model, kernel, iterative reconstruction). Once the segmentations have been approved, a range of quantifiable features can be visualized in the workstation: parenchyma features, airway features, and fissural completeness. Measurements are reported for both inspiration and expiration for the whole lung as well as per lobe and segment. Changes between inspiration and expiration are reported. After workup of a study of a {COPD} patient, a structured report is produced that contains screenshots, renderings, and all requested measurements. 5) {TB} Diagnostics. In this mode chest radiographs can be inspected and texture analysis that detects
                             abnormalities consistent with {TB} can be inspected. A novel symmetry analysis is available to facilitate contralateral comparisons. Detection and quantification of costophrenic angle bluntness is included. Cavities can be semi-automatically segmented. DEMONSTRATION STRATEGY The exhibit will be accompanied by an informational poster that will highlight the key features and algorithmic concepts that underlie the automated analysis. Attendees will be able to gain hands-on experience with the workstation and read cases. For each reading mode, extensive example datasets are available. In particular, the completely processed {LIDC/IDRI} database, including all {CT} scans and chest radiographs, is available for inspection. REFERENCES AND PUBLICATIONS The algorithms presented in the showcase are based on over 20 different journal publications. These are listed on http://cirrus.diagnijmegen.nl.},

The system contains algorithms to normalize the images, segment the lung fields, analyze the shape of the segmented lungs, detect textural abnormalities, measure bluntness of the costophrenic angles and quantify the asymmetry in the lung fields. These subsystems are combined with a Random Forest classifier into an overall score indicating the abnormality of the radiograph. The results approach the performance of an independent human reader.},

  title = {Feasibility of Rapid Reading of {CT} Lung Cancer Screening with Computer-Aided Detection Support},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: The reading effort associated with CT lung cancer screening programs is substantial. We investigated the performance of rapid reading of chest CT scans with integrated CAD support, with the goal of quickly assigning a subject to either regular one-year follow-up, short-term follow-up or immediate work-up. METHOD AND MATERIALS: From the baseline round of a large randomized controlled low-dose CT lung cancer screening trial, randomly 23 cases were selected from each of the three categories used in the trial: 1) no significant nodules, 1 year follow-up CT; 2) nodule 50-500 mm3, 3 month follow-up CT; 3) nodule >500 mm3, referral to pulmonologist. All 69 cases were pre-processed with three different CAD systems aimed at detecting both solid and subsolid lesions and set to operate at high sensitivity. CAD marks were merged and presented in a prototype software environment optimized for rapid reading that includes one-click immediate volumetric segmentation and study preloading to navigate to the next case in the worklist without delay. Seven blinded readers read all cases in random order in a single session as follows. First, CAD marks were inspected and accepted or rejected. Next, readers quickly inspected the scan and added relevant nodules if CAD had not identified these. Finally, readers assigned the scan to one of the three categories of the screening protocol. RESULTS: Cases had 5.1 CAD marks on average. 73A,A+-7% of cases (range 58-80%) were assigned to the correct category. 94% of discordances were between category 1 versus 2, or category 2 versus 3. In most cases the reason was that the volume of the most suspicious nodule was very close to the cutpoints used in the screening protocol. Of the 23 cases in category 3, 14 contained lung cancer. None of these were put in category 1 by any reader; only two of these were placed in category 2, each by only 1/7 readers. 2/9 of the benign category 3 cases were put in category 1: one case by 4/7 readers (a relatively large pleural lesion missed by CAD), and one by 1/7 readers. Total median reading time per case was 67A,A+-17 seconds. CONCLUSION: With the support of highly effective CAD systems, nodule volumetry, and an optimized reading environment, it is possible to accurately read lung cancer CT scans in around one minute per case. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: An optimized reading environment is presented that can be used for large scale implementation of lung CT screening.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the most powerful technique for a range of different tasks in computer vision. Recent work suggested that CNN features are generic and can be used for classification tasks outside the exact domain for which the networks were trained. In this work we use the features from one such network, OverFeat, trained for object detection in natural images, for nodule detection in computed tomography scans. We use 865 scans from the publicly available LIDC data set, read by four thoracic radiologists. Nodule candidates are generated by a state-of-theart nodule detection system. We extract 2D sagittal, coronal and axial patches for each nodule candidate and extract 4096 features from the penultimate layer of OverFeat and classify these with linear support vector machines. We show for various configurations that the off-the-shelf CNN features perform surprisingly well, but not as good as the dedicated detection system. When both approaches are combined, significantly better results are obtained than either approach alone. We conclude that CNN features have great potential to be used for detection tasks in volumetric medical data.},

Recently, algorithms based on deep learning, in particular, convolutional neural networks, have been developed that report high sensitivity with low false positive rates. Similar deep learning algorithms have been successful in classifying nodules as solid, subsolid or part-solid with accuracy comparable to radiologists, and in estimating the probability of malignancy of nodules.

The introduction of digital pathology with whole-slide imaging (WSI) in clinical research, trials and practice has catalyzed the application of artificial intelligence (AI) for histopathology, with development of novel machine-learning models for tissue interrogation and discovery. We aimed to review the literature for studies specifically applying AI algorithms to WSI-digitized pre-implantation kidney biopsy. A systematic search was carried out in the electronic databases PubMed-MEDLINE and Embase until 25th September, 2021 with a combination of the key terms "kidney", "biopsy", "transplantation" and "artificial intelligence" and their aliases. Studies dealing with the application of AI algorithms coupled with WSI in pre-implantation kidney biopsies were included. The main theme addressed was detection and quantification of tissue components. Extracted data were: author, year and country of the study, type of biopsy features investigated, number of cases, type of algorithm deployed, main results of the study in terms of diagnostic outcome, and the main limitations of the study. Of 5761 retrieved articles, 7 met our inclusion criteria. All studies focused largely on AI-based detection and classification of glomerular structures and to a lesser extent on tubular and vascular structures. Performance of AI algorithms was excellent and promising. All studies highlighted the importance of expert pathologist annotation to reliably train models and the need to acknowledge clinical nuances of the pre-implantation setting. Close cooperation between computer scientists and practicing as well as expert renal pathologists is needed, helping to refine the performance of AI-based models for routine pre-implantation kidney biopsy clinical practice.},

Objective: We examined the associations of longitudinally measured fetal and infant growth patterns with total and abdominal fat distribution in childhood. Design, Settings and participants: We performed a population-based prospective cohort study among 6,464 children. We measured growth characteristics in second and third trimester of pregnancy, at birth, and at 6, 12, and 24 months. Main Outcomes Measures: Body mass index, fat mass index (body fat mass/height2), lean mass index (body lean mass/height2) and android/gynoid fat ratio measured by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry, and subcutaneous and preperitoneal abdominal fat measured by ultrasound at the median age of 6.0 years (90% range 5.7 AC/a,!aEURoe 7.4). Results: We observed that weight gain in second and third trimester of fetal life, and in early, mid and late infancy were independently and positively associated with childhood body mass index (p-values<0.05). Only infant weight gain was associated with higher fat mass index, android/gynoid fat ratio, and abdominal fat in childhood (p-values<0.05). Children with both fetal and infant growth acceleration had the highest childhood body mass index, fat mass index and subcutaneous abdominal fat, whereas children with fetal growth deceleration and infant growth acceleration had the highest value for android/gynoid fat ratio and the lowest value for lean mass index (p-values<0.05). Conclusions: Both growth in fetal life and infancy affects childhood body mass index, whereas only infant growth affects directly measured total body and abdominal fat. Fetal growth deceleration followed by infant growth acceleration may lead to an adverse body fat distribution in childhood.},

                             Methods : Two independent data sets were used to develop and evaluate the proposed method. 1) 805 color fundus images with a field of view of 45 degrees, centered on the macula and including the optic disc (OD) from patients with age ranging from 55 to 86 years old included in a glaucoma detection campaign performed at Hospital Esperanza (Barcelona). Annotations were performed by eight observers having 8 to 26 years of clinical experience. 2) 101 images from the publicly available Drishti-GS retinal image dataset (http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/projects/mip/drishti-gs/mip-dataset2/Home.php). The total 906 images were further organized into a training, monitoring and test set according to a 60-20-20 split. The process to train and validate the CNN had 3 steps. 1) Preprocessing: the edges and the background were blurred to reduce the effect of the bright fringe and the border. Then patches centered at the OD of size 256x256x3 pixels were automatically segmented and scaled to values from 0 to 1. 2) Implementation: The architecture consisted of ten convolutional layers (32 filters 3x3 pixels size) followed by rectified linear units and spatial max-pooling. The network ends with a fully connected layer and a soft-max classifier which outputs a score from 0 to 1. The network was trained using stochastic gradient descent and a learning rate of 0.005. To avoid overfitting data augmentation was performed applying randomly translations, flipping and rotations during the training, and dropout with probability of 0.5. 3) Monitoring and evaluation: the training was completed after 50 epochs. To evaluate the classification capabilities of the algorithm, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was calculated using the training set.

                             Results : An automatic classification algorithm based on CNN was developed. The present method achieved an area under the ROC of 0.894. The accuracy to identify healthy and glaucoma cases was 0.884 and 0.781 respectively, using a threshold of 0.5.

                             Conclusions : The good performance of the proposed CNN architecture suggests potential usefulness of these methods for an initial automatic classification of images in screening campaigns for glaucoma.},

  title = {Opening the "black box" of deep learning in automated screening of eye diseases},
  abstract = {Purpose:  Systems based on deep learning (DL) have demonstrated to provide a scalable and high-performance solution for screening of eye diseases. However, DL is usually considered a "black box? due to lack of interpretability. We propose a deep visualization framework to explain the decisions made by a DL system, iteratively unveiling abnormalities responsible for referable predictions without needing lesion-level annotations. We apply the framework to automated screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in color fundus images (CFIs).

                             Methods: The proposed framework consists of a baseline deep convolutional neural network to classify CFIs by DR stage. For each CFI classified as referable DR, the framework extracts initial visual evidence of the predicted stage by computing a saliency map, which indicates regions in the image that would contribute the most to changes in the prediction if modified. This provides localization of abnormalities that are then removed through selective inpainting. The image is again classified, expecting reduced referability. We iteratively apply this procedure to increase attention to less discriminative areas and generate refined visual evidence. The Kaggle DR database, with CFIs graded regarding DR severity (stages 0 and 1: non-referable DR, stages 2 to 4: referable DR), is used for training and validation of the image-level classification task. For validation of the obtained visual evidence, we used the DiaretDB1 dataset, which contains CFIs with manually-delineated areas for 4 types of lesions: hemorrhages, microaneurysms, hard and soft exudates.

                             Results: The baseline classifier obtained an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.93 and a quadratic weighted kappa of 0.77 on the Kaggle test set (53576 CFIs). Free-response ROC (FROC) curves (Figure 2) analyze the correspondence between highlighted areas and each type of lesion for those images classified as referable DR in the DiaretDB1 dataset (62 CFIs), comparing between initial and refined visual evidence.

                             Conclusions : The proposed framework provides visual evidence for the decisions made by a DL system, iteratively unveiling abnormalities in CFIs based on the prediction of a classifier trained only with image-level labels. This provides a "key? to open the "black box? of artificial intelligence in screening of eye diseases, aiming to increase experts' trust and facilitate its integration in screening settings.},

Evaluation of joint detection of referable DR and AMD was performed on a DR-AMD dataset with 600 images acquired during routine clinical practice, containing referable and non-referable cases of both diseases. Each image was graded for DR and AMD by an experienced ophthalmologist to establish the reference standard (RS), and by four independent observers for comparison with human performance. Validation was furtherly assessed on Messidor (1200 images) for individual identification of referable DR, and the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) dataset (133 821 images) for referable AMD, against the corresponding RS. Regarding joint validation on the DR-AMD dataset, the system achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 95.1% for detection of referable DR (SE = 90.1%, SP = 90.6%). For referable AMD, the AUC was 94.9% (SE = 91.8%, SP = 87.5%). Average human performance for DR was SE = 61.5% and SP = 97.8%; for AMD, SE = 76.5% and SP = 96.1%. Regarding detection of referable DR in Messidor, AUC was 97.5% (SE = 92.0%, SP = 92.1%); for referable AMD in AREDS, AUC was 92.7% (SE = 85.8%, SP = 86.0%). The validated system performs comparably to human experts at simultaneous detection of DR and AMD. This shows that DL systems can facilitate access to joint screening of eye diseases and become a quick and reliable support for ophthalmological experts.},

  title = {Are adversarial attacks an actual threat for deep learning systems in real-world eye disease screening settings?},
  abstract = {Purpose:
      				Deep learning (DL) systems that perform image-level classification with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to provide high-performance solutions for automated screening of eye diseases. Nevertheless, adversarial attacks have been recently screening settings, where there is restricted access to the systems and limited knowledge about certain factors, such as their CNN architecture or the data used for development.
    				Setting:
    				Deep learning for automated screening of eye diseases.
    				Methods:
    				We used the Kaggle dataset for diabetic retinopathy detection. It contains 88,702 manually-labelled color fundus images, which we split into test (12%) and development (88%). Development data were split into two equally-sized sets (d1 and d2); a third set (d3) was generated using half of the images in d2. In each development set, 80%/20% of the images were used for training/validation. All splits were done randomly at patient-level. As attacked system, we developed a randomly-initialized CNN based on the Inception-v3 architecture using d1. We performed the attacks (1) in a white-box (WB) setting, with full access to the attacked system to generate the adversarial images, and (2) in black-box (BB) settings, without access to the attacked system and using a surrogate system to craft the attacks. We simulated different BB settings, sequentially decreasing the available knowledge about the attacked system: same architecture, using d1 (BB-1); different architecture (randomly-initialized DenseNet-121), using d1 (BB-2); same architecture, using d2 (BB-3); different architecture, using d2 (BB-4); different architecture, using d3 (BB-5). In each setting, adversarial images containing non-perceptible noise were generated by applying the fast gradient sign method to each image of the test set and processed by the attacked system.
    				Results:
    				The performance of the attacked system to detect referable diabetic retinopathy without attacks and under the different attack settings was measured on the test set using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Without attacks, the system achieved an AUC of 0.88. In each attack setting, the relative decrease in AUC with respect to the original performance was computed. In the WB setting, there was a 99.9% relative decrease in performance. In the BB-1 setting, the relative decrease in AUC was 67.3%. In the BB-2 setting, the AUC suffered a 40.2% relative decrease. In the BB-3 setting, the relative decrease was 37.9%. In the BB-4 setting, the relative decrease in AUC was 34.1%. Lastly, in the BB-5 setting, the performance of the attacked system decreased 3.8% regarding its original performance.
    				Conclusions:
    				The results obtained in the different settings show a drastic decrease of the attacked DL system's vulnerability to adversarial attacks when the access and knowledge about it are limited. The impact on performance is extremely reduced when restricting the direct access to the system (from the WB to the BB-1 setting). The attacks become slightly less effective when not having access to the same development data (BB-3), compared to not using the same CNN architecture (BB-2). Attacks' effectiveness further decreases when both factors are unknown (BB-4). If the amount of development data is additionally reduced (BB-5), the original performance barely deteriorates. This last setting is the most similar to realistic screening settings, since most systems are currently closed source and use additional large private datasets for development. In conclusion, these factors should be acknowledged for future development of robust DL systems, as well as considered when evaluating the vulnerability of currently-available systems to adversarial attacks. Having limited access and knowledge about the systems determines the actual threat these attacks pose. We believe awareness about this matter will increase experts' trust and facilitate the integration of DL systems in real-world settings.},

  title = {Hierarchical curriculum learning for robust automated detection of low-prevalence retinal disease features: application to reticular pseudodrusen},
  abstract = {Purpose: The low prevalence of certain retinal disease features compromises data collection for deep neural networks (DNN) development and, consequently, the benefits of automated detection. We robustify the detection of such features in scarce data settings by exploiting hierarchical information available in the data to learn from generic to specific, low-prevalence features. We focus on reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), a hallmark of intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

     Methods: Color fundus images (CFI) from the AREDS dataset were used for DNN development (106,994 CFI) and testing (27,066 CFI). An external test set (RS1-6) was generated with 2,790 CFI from the Rotterdam Study. In both datasets CFI were graded from generic to specific features. This allows to establish a hierarchy of binary classification tasks with decreasing prevalence: presence of AMD findings (AREDS prevalence: 88%; RS1-6: 77%), drusen (85%; 73%), large drusen (40%; 24%), RPD (1%; 4%). We created a hierarchical curriculum and developed a DNN (HC-DNN) that learned each task sequentially. We computed its performance for RPD detection in both test sets and compared it to a baseline DNN (B-DNN) that learned to detect RPD from scratch disregarding hierarchical information. We studied their robustness across datasets, while reducing the size of data available for development (same prevalences)

     Results: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to measure RPD detection performance. When large development data were available, there was no significant difference between DNNs (100% data, HC-DNN: 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.97) in AREDS, 0.82 (0.78-0.86) in RS1-6; B-DNN: 0.95 (0.94-0.96) in AREDS, 0.83 (0.79-0.87) in RS1-6). However, HC-DNN achieved better performance and robustness across datasets when development data were highly reduced (<50% data, p-values<0.05) (1% data, HC-DNN: 0.63 (0.60-0.66) in AREDS, 0.76 (0.72-0.80) in RS1-6; B-DNN: 0.53 (0.49-0.56) in AREDS, 0.48 (0.42-0.53) in RS1-6).

     Conclusions: Hierarchical curriculum learning allows for knowledge transfer from general, higher-prevalence features and becomes beneficial for the detection of low-prevalence retinal features, such as RPD, in scarce data settings. Moreover, exploiting hierarchical information improves DNN robustness across datasets.},

  title = {Deep learning for automated stratification of ophthalmic images: Application to age-related macular degeneration and color fundus images},
  abstract = {Purpose: Deep learning (DL) systems based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved expert-level performance in different classification tasks, and have shown the potential to reduce current experts' workload significantly. We explore this potential in the context of automated stratification of ophthalmic images. DL could accelerate the setup of clinical studies by filtering large amounts of images or patients based on specific inclusion criteria, as well as aid in patient selection for clinical trials. DL could also allow for automated categorization of entering images in busy clinical or screening settings, enhancing data triaging, searching, retrieval, and comparison. Automated stratification could also facilitate data collection and application of further DL-based phenotyping analysis, by generating useful sets of images for expert annotation, training, or testing of segmentation algorithms. In our work, we focus on the stratification of color fundus images (CFI) based on multiple features related to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) at different hierarchical levels. We further analyze the robustness of the automated stratification system when the amount of data available for development is limited. We performed our validation on two different population studies.

     Setting/Venue: Deep learning applied to ophthalmic imaging.

     Methods: Automated stratification of CFI was performed based on the presence or absence of the following AMD features, following a hierarchical tree with different branches (Bi) and levels (Hi) from generic features (H0) to specific features (H3): AMD findings (H0); B1: drusen (H1), large drusen (H2), reticular pseudodrusen (H3); B2: pigmentary changes (H1), hyperpigmentation (H2), hypopigmentation (H2); B3: late AMD (H1), geographic atrophy (H2), choroidal neovascularization (H2). The automated stratification system consisted of a set of CNNs (based on the Inception-v3 architecture) able to classify the multiple AMD features (presence/absence) at higher and lower levels. This allowed to automatically stratify incoming CFI into the hierarchical tree. CFI from the AREDS dataset were used for development (106,994 CFI) and testing (27,066 CFI) of the CNNs. We validated the robustness of the system to a gradual decrease in the amount of data available for development (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, 2.5%, and 1% of development data). An external test set (RS1-6) was generated with 2,790 CFI from the Rotterdam Study. This allowed to validate the performance of the automated stratification across studies where different CFI grading protocols were used.

     Results: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to measure the performance of each feature's classification within the automated stratification. The AUC averaged across AMD features when 100% of development data was available was 93.8% (95% CI, 93.4%-94.2%) in AREDS and 84.4% (82.1%-86.5%) in RS1-6. There was an average relative decrease in performance of 10.0+-4.7% between AREDS and the external test set, RS1-6. The performance of the system decreased gradually with each development data reduction. When only 1% of data was available for development, the average AUC was 81.9% (81.0%-82.8%) in AREDS and 74.0% (70.8%-77.0%) in RS1-6. This corresponded to an average relative decrease in performance of 12.7+-13.2% in AREDS and 12.6+-7.8% in RS1-6.

     Conlusions: The automated stratification system achieved overall high performance in the classification of different features independently of their hierarchical level. This shows the potential of DL systems to identify diverse phenotypes and to obtain an accurate automated stratification of CFI. The results showed that automated stratification was also robust to a dramatic reduction in the data available for development, maintaining the average AUC above 80%. This is a positive observation, considering that the amount of data available for DL development can be limited in some settings, and the gradings can be costly to obtain. Nevertheless, variability in performance across features could be observed, especially for those with very low prevalence, such as reticular pseudodrusen, where performance became more unstable when few data were available. The external validation showed these observations held when the automated stratification was applied in a different population study, with an expected (but not drastic) drop of performance due to differences between datasets and their grading protocols. In conclusion, our work supports that DL is a powerful tool for the filtering and stratification of ophthalmic images, and has the potential to reduce the workload of experts while supporting them in research and clinical settings.},

  title = {Trustworthy AI: closing the gap between development and integration of AI in Ophthalmology},
  abstract = {Design: Descriptive study.

     Purpose: To identify the main aspects that currently complicate the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in ophthalmic settings.

     Methods: Based on an extensive review of state-of-the-art literature of AI applied to Ophthalmology plus interviews with multidisciplinary, international experts, we identified the most relevant aspects to consider during AI design to generate trustworthy (i.e.,  transparent, robust, and sustainable) AI systems and, consequently, facilitate a subsequent successful integration in real-world ophthalmic settings.

     Results: Several essential aspects to consider were identified:
     1) The reliability of the human annotations that are used for establishing the reference standard an AI system learns from, or for setting robust observer studies that allow for fair human-AI performance comparison.
     2) The ability of an AI system to generalize across populations, ophthalmic settings, and data acquisition protocols in order to avoid the negative consequences of algorithmic bias and lack of domain adaptation.
     3)The integration of multimodal data for AI development to consider multiple contexts when available (phenotyping, genotyping, systemic variables, patient medical history...).
     4) The importance of providing interpretable AI-based predictions to open the "black box" and increase trust and clinical usability.
     5) A plan to monitor the impact of AI on the clinical workflow, i.e., the adaptation of healthcare providers and patients to the new technology, human-AI interaction, cost-benefit analyses...
     6) The necessity to update current regulations to accelerate and control AI integration and all related aspects, such as patient privacy, systems' updates, and liability.

     Conclusions: It is important that healthcare providers in Ophthalmology consider these aspects and their consequences when thinking of AI in practice. It is key that all involved stakeholders collaborate and interact from the beginning of the AI design process to ensure a good alignment with real-world clinical needs and settings. This way, it will be possible to generate trustworthy AI solutions and close the gap between development and deployment, so that the AI benefits currently shown on paper reach the final users.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of artificial intelligence (AI) systems are being proposed in ophthalmology, motivated by the variety and amount of clinical and imaging data, as well as their potential benefits at the different stages of patient care. Despite achieving close or even superior performance to that of experts, there is a critical gap between development and integration of AI systems in ophthalmic practice. This work focuses on the importance of trustworthy AI to close that gap. We identify the main aspects or challenges that need to be considered along the AI design pipeline so as to generate systems that meet the requirements to be deemed trustworthy, including those concerning accuracy, resiliency, reliability, safety, and accountability. We elaborate on mechanisms and considerations to address those aspects or challenges, and define the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders involved in AI for ophthalmic care, i.e., AI developers, reading centers, healthcare providers, healthcare institutions, ophthalmological societies and working groups or committees, patients, regulatory bodies, and payers. Generating trustworthy AI is not a responsibility of a sole stakeholder. There is an impending necessity for a collaborative approach where the different stakeholders are represented along the AI design pipeline, from the definition of the intended use to post-market surveillance after regulatory approval. This work contributes to establish such multi-stakeholder interaction and the main action points to be taken so that the potential benefits of AI reach real-world ophthalmic settings.},

One hundred forty individuals (67 men, 73 women; mean age, 59 years) underwent screening 64-MDCT colonography after full cathartic bowel cleansing without fecal tagging. One expert reader interpreted supine and prone scans using a 3D workstation with integrated CAD used as "second reader." The system's sensitivity for the detection of polyps, the number of false-positive findings, and its running time were evaluated. Polyps were classified as small (< or =5 mm), medium (6-9 mm), and large (> or =10 mm). A total of 118 polyps (small, 85; medium, 19; large, 14) were found in 56 patients. CAD detected 72 polyps (61\%) with an average of 2.2 false-positives. Sensitivity was 51\% (43/85) for small, 90\% (17/19) for medium, and 86\% (12/14) for large polyps. For all polyps, per-patient sensitivity was 89\% (50/56) for the radiologist and 73\% (41/56) for CAD. For large and medium polyps, per-patient sensitivity was 100\% for the radiologist, and 96\% for CAD. In conclusion, CAD shows high sensitivity in the detection of clinically significant polyps with acceptable false-positive rates.},

  title = {Semi-supervised 3D universal lesion segmentation in CT thorax-abdomen scans},
  booktitle = ECR,
  year = {2022},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: Extracting volumetric information using automated lesion segmentation could allow for more accurate quantification of disease response in heterogeneous lesions. Using a single model for Universal Lesion Segmentation has the potential for faster inference times compared to multi-model approaches and allows for internal representation of lesion type features. METHODS: We compiled eight public datasets with segmentation masks for various lesion types in CT thorax-abdomen scans. Scans were resampled to 1mm isotropic voxel spacing and regions of interest were cropped centered on each lesion. A nnUnet was trained with 3213 lesions from 1481 studies and used to predict 3D segmentation masks for the circa 32,000 partially annotated lesions from the DeepLesion dataset. Masks were further refined by applying the GrabCut algorithm in three orthogonal directions based on the provided long and short-axis diameter measurements. We fine-tuned the nnUnet using the resulting masks and evaluated on a test set with full annotations. We experimented with epoch numbers and learning rate decay. All models were trained using 5-fold cross validation. RESULTS: Fine-tuning the model using the DeepLesion masks improved segmentation performance from 0.71 to 0.73 Dice compared to the baseline nnUnet. Segmentation performance ranged from 0.53, 0.61, 0.66, 0.77, 0.79 to 0.9 Dice for colon, pancreas, lymph node, lung, liver and kidney lesions. CONCLUSIONS: 3D universal lesion segmentation using large, aggregated datasets shows promise as an alternative to lesion specific models. By incorporating partially annotated data in a semi-supervised manner we can further increase data volume and model performance with minimal annotation effort. LIMITATIONS: This study used a small number of scans in the test set and did not evaluate model performance on out-of-distribution lesion types.

  booktitle = ECR,

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Automating aspects of RECIST evaluation can save time and potentially reduce inter-observer variability. We trained a 3D Universal Lesion Segmentation model (ULS) to estimate long and short axis diameters in CT exams based on a single click inside the lesion. METHODS: We used the nnUnet framework to train the ULS using 3213 lesions from 1481 studies collected from eight public challenge datasets. We fine-tuned the model using masks predicted for lesions from a subset of the public DeepLesion dataset. A reader study was conducted with 128 separate DeepLesion scans. Four radiologists manually measured long- and short-axis of lesions on axial CT slices and assessed whether a lesion was eligible as target lesion. RESULTS: For 85 out of 128 scans, all readers agreed that it contained a valid RECIST target lesion. For those lesions, the relative difference between the DeepLesion measurements and the radiologists was -4.2% +- 14.2 and -0.3% +- 13.2, for the long and short axis respectively. For ULS these measures were 6% +- 17 and -5.8% +- 18.9. The mean absolute differences were 2.5 +- 3 mm and 1.9 +- 2 mm for radiologists. For ULS these measures were 4.1 +- 5.8 mm and 2.8 +- 2.7mm. For 78.8% of lesions the absolute difference between DeepLesion and ULS measurements fell within a standard deviation of the inter-radiologist variability. CONCLUSIONS: Single-click measurement using ULS shows promise to simplify and speed-up RECIST evaluation in circa 80% oncological CT exams. LIMITATIONS: This study used a small number of lesions in the test set, and readers measured long and short axis in all lesions, which is not required by RECIST.

  abstract = {Purpose: To develop a new algorithm for a reliable fully-automatic method for the detection and quantification of drusen in color fundus images. Methods: Sixty color fundus images of 15 patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and of 15 control subjects, centered on the macula with a field of view of 60?, were used. Images were acquired with a flood illuminated 3CCD fundus camera (TRX 50DX, Topcon Medical Systems). Two trained graders annotated all visible drusen in the 60 images. One was used as reference standard and the other as second observer. The proposed method uses a two-step classification. In a first step, candidate drusen objects were extracted using a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier and Gaussian filter outputs. In a second step, these were classified as being true drusen or not by a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, using features based on shape, context, intensity and color. Results: The proposed algorithm was evaluated using a patient-based 3-fold cross-validation scheme. The figure of Merit of the FROC was 0.4016 using JAFROC analysis. The second observer has a sensitivity of 0.82 at a false positive rate of 30.12 per image. At the same false positive rate, the system obtained a sensitivity of 0.79 which was comparable to the second observer. Conclusions: A method based on a SVM classifier was presented for drusen detection and quantification on color fundus images. The method is able to detect drusen automatically in the central and peripheral zone. By not only detecting, but also quantifying the drusen, this method opens the way for automatic diagnosis and classification of AMD.},

This workstation gathers the output of several computer-aided diagnosis modules for fundus image processing. These modules include algorithms to automatically segment vessels1, to detect anatomical structures like the optic disk and fovea location2, and to automatically detect different kind of lesions3. The workstation allows the quantitative analysis of retinal lesions and structures which can help in the diagnosis and quantification of major eye diseases including Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Glaucoma. In addition to overlays highlighting individual lesion, quantitative measurements are collected in structured reports similar to the ones used in clinical practice. In the future, the workstation will be integrated into a publicly available web-based system. This way, research groups will be able to test the system on their own data sets in order to allow a comparison with their own developed software. This approach provides a new methodology for evaluating and comparing computer-aided diagnosis systems without the need to make code or executables publicly available and without being bound by the use of public data sets or by the performance measurements currently proposed in challenges.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate a machine learning algorithm that allows for computer aided diagnosis (CAD) of non-advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by providing an accurate detection and quantification of drusen location, area and size. METHODS: Color fundus photographs of 407 eyes without AMD or with early to moderate AMD were randomly selected from a large European multicenter database. A machine learning system was developed to automatically detect and quantify drusen on each image. Based on detected drusen, the CAD software provided a risk assessment to develop advanced AMD. Evaluation of the CAD system was performed using annotations made by two blinded human graders. RESULTS: Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristics (FROC) analysis showed that the proposed system approaches the performance of human observers in detecting drusen. The estimated drusen area showed excellent agreement with both observers, with mean intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) larger than 0.85. Maximum druse diameter agreement was lower with a maximum ICC of 0.69 but comparable to the interobserver agreement (ICC=0.79). For automatic AMD risk assessment, the system achieved areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.948 and 0.954, reaching similar performance as human observers. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning system, capable of separating high risk from low risk patients with non-advanced AMD by providing accurate detection and quantification of drusen, was developed. The proposed method allows for quick and reliable diagnosis of AMD, opening the way for large dataset analysis within population studies and genotype-phenotype correlation analysis.},

  abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration ({AMD}) is a degenerative disorder of the central parts of the retina, which mainly affects older people and leads to permanent loss of vision in advanced stages of the disease. {AMD} grading of non-advanced {AMD} patients allows risk assessment for the development of advanced {AMD} and enables timely treatment of patients, to prevent vision loss. {AMD} grading is currently performed manually on color fundus images, which is time consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose a supervised classification method to distinguish high risk {AMD} patients from low risk {AMD} patients and provide an exact {AMD} stage determination. The method is based on the analysis of the number and size of drusen on color fundus images, as drusen are the early characteristics of {AMD}. An automatic drusen detection algorithm is used to detect all drusen. A weighted histogram of the detected drusen is constructed to summarize the drusen extension and size and fed into a random forest classifier in order to separate low risk from high risk patients and to allow exact {AMD} stage determination. Experiments show the proposed method achieved similar performance as human observers in distinguishing low risk from high risk {AMD} patients, obtaining areas under the {R}eceiver {O}perating {C}haracteristic curve of 0.929 and 0.934. A weighted kappa agreement of 0.641 and 0.622 versus two observers were obtained for {AMD} stage evaluation. Our method allows for quick and reliable {AMD} staging at low costs.},

  abstract = {Population screening for sight threatening diseases based on fundus imaging is in place or being considered worldwide. Most existing programs are focussed on a specific disease and are based on manual reading of images, though automated image analysis based solutions are being developed. Exudates and drusen are bright lesions which indicate very different diseases, but can appear to be similar. Discriminating between them is of interest to increase screening performance. In this paper, we present a Bag of Words approach which can be used to design a system that can play the dual role of content based retrieval (of images with exudates or drusen) system and a decision support system to address the problem of bright lesion discrimination. The approach consists of a novel partitioning of an image into patches from which colour, texture, edge and granulometry based features are extracted to build a dictionary. A bag of words approach is then employed to help retrieve images matching a query image as well as derive a decision on the type of bright lesion in the given (query) image. This approach has been implemented and tested on a combination of public and local dataset of 415 images. The area under the curve for image classification is 0.90 and retrieved precision is 0.76.},

  booktitle = ARVO,
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {Purpose: Reticular drusen ({RD}) have been shown to be associated with a high risk of progression to neovascular age-related macular degeneration. {RD} identification is challenging due to their subtle characteristics on fundus images, especially using a single imaging method. We report a machine learning system to automatically identify {RD} using multiple retinal imaging modalities. Methods: Color fundus photographs ({CFP}), fundus autofluorescent images ({FAF}) and near-infrared reflectance images ({NIR}) of 175 eyes of 158 patients with presence of either reticular drusen, soft distinct/indistinct drusen, or no signs of drusen were selected from the {R}otterdam {S}tudy, a population-based cohort. A machine learning system was developed to automatically identify eyes with presence of reticular drusen. First, semi-automatic multimodal affine image registration was performed. After this, features based on {G}aussian moments were calculated on the red, green and blue color channels of the {CFP} as well as on the {FAF} and {NIR} images and combined using a random forest classifier to make a classification. Evaluation was performed by comparing the system output with annotations made by an experienced human grader. Results: The human grader identified 44 eyes with reticular drusen, 78 eyes with soft distinct/indistinct drusen and 53 eyes without drusen in the dataset. The system was evaluated using {R}eceiver {O}perating {C}haracteristics ({ROC}) curve analysis in a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. The proposed system was able to identify images with {RD} with an area under the {ROC} curve ({AUC}) of 0.849 and highest accuracy of 0.857. An {AUC} of 0.887 was obtained for the differentiation between images with {RD} and images without drusen; whereas an {AUC} of 0.834 was achieved if the task was to distinguish images with {RD} from images with soft distinct/indistinct drusen. Conclusions: A machine learning system, using information of different retinal imaging modalities, was developed for the identification of patients with reticular drusen. The proposed system achieved good performance and allows for a fast and accurate reticular drusen detection using several imaging modalities in an automated way.},

All eyes were scored for presence of RPD during single- and multimodality setups by two experienced observers and a developed machine learning system.

The proposed automatic system achieved an area under the ROC of 0.941 with a multimodality setup. Automatic RPD quantification resulted in an intraclass correlation (ICC) value of 0.704, which was comparable with ICC values obtained between single-modality manual delineations.Observer performance and agreement for RPD identification improved significantly by using a multimodality grading approach. The developed automatic system showed similar performance as observers, and automatic RPD area quantification was in concordance with manual delineations.

Detection of these diseases at an early stage can help to identify patients that would benefit from treatment to slow or prevent their progression into more severe stages with visual loss. We report an automatic software solution for the detection of early stages of {DRP} and {AMD} using color fundus ({CF}) images. Methods: {CF} images from several public datasets ({D}iaret{B}0, {D}iaret{B}1, {S}tare, {M}essidor, {DR}1/{DR}2) and two private data sets were pooled together and used in this study. Only macular centered images with sufficient quality for manual assessment were included. Images in advanced stages of AMD or DRP were excluded. The remaining study set consisted of 2128 CF images. All images were labeled by an expert into one of three classes: early stage DRP, early stage AMD or control. Two existing machine learning systems, one for early stage AMD detection and one for early stage DRP detection, were combined to detect the early stages of DRP and AMD simultaneously. Final classification features of both systems were concatenated and a random forest classifier was trained to make a classification between the target cases (early stage {DRP} or {AMD}) and the control cases. Evaluation was performed by comparing the output of the system with the human expert's labels. Results: The human expert labeled 596 and 196 cases as early stage {DRP} or {AMD}, respectively. The remaining 1336 {CF} images were labeled as controls. The automatic system was evaluated using {R}eceiver {O}perating {C}haracteristics ({ROC}) curve analysis in a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. The combined system for detection of the early stages of {DRP} and {AMD} was able to separate the target cases from the control cases with an area under the {ROC} curve ({AUC}) of 0.948. The system achieved a sensitivity of 0.880 and a specificity of 0.886. Conclusions: A machine learning system was developed for the identification of early stages of {AMD} and {DRP}.

  booktitle = ARVO,
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Purpose: The presence of hemorrhages is one of the common signs of diabetic retinopathy ({DRP}), a vision threatening retinal disease affecting patient with diabetes. Automatic detection of hemorrhages is important to facilitate the timely detection of patients that would benefit from treatment to slow down or prevent disease progression to vision-threatening stages of {DRP}. We report an automatic system based on deep learning to automatically detect hemorrhages on color fundus images. Methods: Data was drawn from two public datasets ({K}aggle and {M}essidor) by selecting images with sufficient quality for analysis, including a total of 4624 and 1102 images, respectively. The {K}aggle set was split into a development (4048) and an evaluation set (576). The {M}essidor set was solely used as external evaluation set. A reference observer indicated presence of hemorrhages for all images and also marked their locations in the development set. Both evaluation sets were also scored for the presence of hemorrhages by two independent human experts. An automatic system based on deep learning, employing a convolutional neural network ({CNN}), was developed and used to identify images with hemorrhages. The {CNN} consisted of a layered architecture of 5 convolutional layers, a fully connected layer, and a final classification layer. The {CNN} used 41x41 pixel sized color patches as input in the first layer. In each convolutional layer, inputs were convolved with a set of small sized filters and the response maps were used as input in the next layer. In the last layer, an image score indicating the likelihood for the presence of hemorrhages was generated. Evaluation was performed by comparing system results and human expert annotations with the reference. Results: The reference observer marked 99 and 289 images as containing hemorrhages; and 477 and 813 as controls in the two test sets. The automatic system achieved areas ({A}z) under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.957 and 0.968 with sensitivity/specificity pairs of 0.889/0.912 and 0.931/0.888, whereas the human experts achieved sensitivity/specificity of 0.919/0.979 and 0.899/0.977 in the {K}aggle test set; and 0.976/0.894 and 0.958/0.872 in the {M}essidor test set. Conclusions: An automatic system was developed for the detection of hemorrhages on color fundus images. The system approaches human expert performance and allows for a fast and reliable identification of patients with moderate to severe {DRP} in a screening setup.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) are deep learning network architectures that have pushed forward the state-of-the-art in a range of computer vision applications and are increasingly popular in medical image analysis. However, training of CNNs is time-consuming and challenging. In medical image analysis tasks, the majority of training examples are easy to classify and therefore contribute little to the CNN learning process. In this paper, we propose a method to improve and speed-up the CNN training for medical image analysis tasks by dynamically selecting misclassified negative samples during training. Training samples are heuristically sampled based on classification by the current status of the CNN. Weights are assigned to the training samples and informative samples are more likely to be included in the next CNN training iteration. We evaluated and compared our proposed method by training a CNN with (SeS) and without (NSeS) the selective sampling method. We focus on the detection of hemorrhages in color fundus images. A decreased training time from 170 epochs to 60 epochs with an increased performance AC/a,!aEURoe on par with two human experts AC/a,!aEURoe was achieved with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.894 and 0.972 on two data sets.

In this study we aimed to determine the capability of SCT in depicting benign and malignant pulmonary nodule enhancement by comparing it to that of DECT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 29 patients with solid pulmonary nodules (>= 4 mm) in a cohort of 295 consecutive patients recruited for a prospective study on PE. Patients were worked up or followed for at least 20 months to obtain a standard of reference. In total, 96 nodules were investigated (72 malignant, 24 benign). Patients in this study had received a pre-contrast CT at 100 kV prior to a dual-energy CT angiography (CTA) at 100 and 140 kV (Siemens Definition Flash, Germany), with 60 ml of iodinated contrast (300 mg I/ml) followed by 40 ml saline flush injected at 5 ml/s. Scan acquisition was 5 s after reaching a relative threshold enhancement (60 HU) in the pulmonary trunk. For SCT, iodine maps were obtained by subtracting the pre contrast from the contrast-enhanced scan after non-rigid registration (Canon Medical Systems, Japan). Nodules were annotated and volumetrically segmented on the CTA on a lung screening workstation (CIRRUS Lung Screening, The Netherlands) and mean enhancement calculated. Student's t-test was used for statistical testing. RESULTS: Mean enhancement of the nodules was significantly higher for SCT than for DECT (34.6+-12.7 vs 25.7+-20.8 HU; p<0.001). Mean enhancement in malignant and benign nodules was 35.5+-11.7 HU and 31.9+-15.4 HU on SCT (p=0.24), and 26.6+-20.7 HU and 22.8+-21.4 HU on DECT (p=0.44), respectively. Dose-length-product was slightly lower for SCT than DECT (156 and 163 mGy*cm; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Subtraction CT shows higher nodule enhancement compared to dual-energy CT. As expected, due to the use of early acquisition, CTA for PE cannot be used to characterize incidental nodules as benign or malignant. However, previous studies have shown the feasibility of nodule characterization with DECT with late acquisition. Therefore, given that it results in better enhancement depiction, it is expected that, SCT with optimized timing could be a promising development for improved nodule characterization at a comparable radiation dose to DECT, without the need for dedicated additional hardware.},

  abstract = {Objective: To compare nodule enhancement on subtraction CT iodine maps to that on dual-energy CT iodine maps using CT datasets acquired simultaneously. Methods: A previously-acquired set of lung subtraction and dual-energy CT maps consisting of thirty patients with 95 solid pulmonary nodules (>=4 mm diameter, 72 malignant) was used. Nodules were annotated and segmented on CT angiography, and mean nodule enhancement in the iodine maps calculated. Three radiologists scored nodule visibility with both techniques on a 4-point scale. Results: Mean nodule enhancement was higher (p < 0.001) at subtraction CT (34.9 +- 12.9HU) than at dual-energy CT (25.4 +- 21.0HU). Nodule enhancement at subtraction CT was judged more often to be "highly visible" for each observers (p < 0.001) with an area under the curve of 0.81. Conclusions: Subtraction CT is able to depict iodine enhancement in pulmonary nodules better than dual-energy CT.},

An example are the pharmacokinetic model calibration methods based on a reference tissue, where a pectoral muscle delineation in breast MRI is needed to detect malignancy signs. Atlas-based segmentation has been proven to be powerful in brain MRI. This is the first attempt to apply an atlas-based approach to segment breast in T1 weighted MR images. The atlas consists of 5 structures (fatty and dense tissues, heart, lungs and pectoral muscle). It has been used in a Bayesian segmentation framework to delineate the mentioned structures. Global and local registration have been compared, where global registration showed the best results in terms of accuracy and speed. Overall, a Dice Similarity Coefficient value of 0.8 has been obtained which shows the validity of our approach to Breast MRI segmentation.},

  abstract = {A precise segmentation of breast tissue is often required for computer-aided diagnosis ({CAD}) of breast {MRI}. Only a few methods have been proposed to automatically segment breast in {MRI}. Authors reported satisfactory performance, but a fair comparison has not been done yet as all breast segmentation methods were evaluated on their own data sets with diferent manual annotations. Moreover, breast volume overlap measures, which were commonly used for evaluations, do not seem to be adequate to accurately quantify the segmentation qualities. Breast volume overlap measures are not sensitive to small errors, such as local misalignments, because breast appears to be much larger than other structures. In this work, two atlas-based approaches and a breast segmentation method based on {H}essian sheetness filter were exhaustively evaluated and benchmarked on a data set of 52 manually annotated breast {MR} images. Three quantitative measures including percentage of missed dense tissue, percentage of missed pectoral muscle and pectoral surface distance were defi ned to objectively reflect the practical use of breast segmentation in {CAD} methods. The evaluation measures provided important evidence to conclude that the three evaluated techniques performed accurate breast segmentations. More speci cally, the atlas-based methods appeared to be more precise, but required larger computation time than the sheetness-based breast segmentation approach.},

Such a system can be used to support radiologists during DCE-MRI analysis, to facilitate pre-calculation of very computationally demanding features and to form the basis of a standalone computer aided diagnosis application. The proposed method initially segments the breast and uses a gentle adaboost classifier and features extracted from the relative signal enhancement to detect malignant lesions. Evaluation was performed on a dataset of 212 DCE-MRI studies from 126 patients with no sign of breast cancer and 86 patients with biopsy-proven annotated malignant lesions. The results obtained by our method are promising for clinical applications: 96% of the lesions of our study dataset were correctly detected at 10.4 false positives per patient without cancer.},

The purpose of this study is to develop a method to automatically compute breast density in breast MRI. The framework is a combination of image processing techniques to segment breast and fibroglandular tissue. Intra- and interpatient signal intensity variability is initially corrected. The breast is segmented by automatically detecting body-breast and air-breast surfaces. Subsequently, fibroglandular tissue is segmented in the breast area using expectation-maximization. A dataset of 50 cases with manual segmentations was used for evaluation. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), total overlap, false negative fraction (FNF), and false positive fraction (FPF) are used to report similarity between automatic and manual segmentations. For breast segmentation, the proposed approach obtained DSC, total overlap, FNF, and FPF values of 0.94, 0.96, 0.04, and 0.07, respectively. For fibroglandular tissue segmentation, we obtained DSC, total overlap, FNF, and FPF values of 0.80, 0.85, 0.15, and 0.22, respectively. The method is relevant for researchers investigating breast density as a risk factor for breast cancer and all the described steps can be also applied in computer aided diagnosis systems.},

In this study, we evaluate the performance of a CADe system in detecting breast cancers missed in screening and compare this to the performance obtained on screen-detected cancers. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We collected DCE-MRI studies from 163 women participating in a high risk screening program. These data included 26 scans with screen-detected cancers, and 23 scans with 10 and 13 cancers that were retrospectively visible (BI-RADS 4/5) or minimally visible (BI-RADS 2/3) in prior MRI screening exams, but were reported to be normal. Cancers were detected at the following screening round. Furthermore, 114 normal scans with no sign of breast cancer were included. Lesions were annotated on the first post-contrast subtraction image. A CADe system was developed in-house. The detection performance was evaluated using free-response receiver operating characteristic and bootstrapping. A CADe finding was considered true positive when its center was inside a lesion annotation. The false-positive rate (FP/case) was determined on the normal cases. RESULTS: At 4 FP/case, the sensitivity for screen-detected lesions was 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.62-0.96). For lesions that were visible or minimally visible in prior false-negative studies, the sensitivities were 0.69 (0.33-1.00) and 0.47 (0.18-0.75), respectively. CONCLUSION: The detection performance for missed cancers of a CADe system was almost as high as for screen-detected cancers. The integration of such a system in clinical practice might aid radiologists to avoid screening errors.},

  year = {2015},
  abstract = {PURPOSE Breast cancer lesions are regularly overlooked or misinterpreted in breast MRI screening due to lesion appearance suggesting benign disease, extensive background enhancement or fatigue and lack of experience analyzing 4D data. In this study, we evaluate the performance of an automated computer-aided detection (CAD) system to detect mass-like, non-mass-like and focus breast cancer lesions that were, in retrospect, visible on earlier screening MRIs but only detected in a subsequent scans. METHOD AND MATERIALS Between 2003 and 2013, we identified 24 prior-negative MRI scans (BI-RADS 1/2) with 24 breast cancers (10 mass-like, 8 non-mass-like and 6 foci) in a MRI screening program. Cancers were detected by radiologists at the following screening round. Additionally, 120 normal scans were collected from the same MRI screening program from different women without history of breast cancer or breast surgery. A previously validated fully automated CAD system was applied to this dataset to detect malignant lesions. The system corrects for motion artifacts and segments the breast. Subsequently, lesion candidates are detected using relative enhancement and texture features to characterize breast cancer lesions. The final classification is performed using region-based morphological and kinetics features computed on segmented lesion candidates. The detection performance was evaluated using free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis and bootstrapping. A CAD finding was considered a true positive when its center was inside a lesion annotation. The false positive rate (FP/case) was determined on the normal cases. RESULTS At 4 FP/case, the sensitivity for detecting mass-like and non-mass-like lesions in prior-negative scans was 0.50 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.83) and 0.85 (0.50-1.00), respectively. At the same FP/case, the CAD system did not detect focus breast cancer lesions. CONCLUSION A CAD system was able to automatically detect 50% and 85% of mass-like and non-mass-like enhancement lesions that were missed in screening with MRI, respectively. Further improvement is required to detect focus lesions. The integration of such a system in clinical practice might aid radiologists to avoid screening errors.

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {PURPOSE Segmentation of anatomical structures in automated 3D breast ultrasound (ABUS) is required for development of computer-aided detection (CAD) and other techniques to make clinical workflow more efficient, such as automatic linking of findings between different ABUS views and multimodal registration. We propose a novel method to segment the anterior pectoral surface in ABUS images. METHOD AND MATERIALS We randomly collected 74 ABUS (25 Anterior-Posterior, 15 MEDial, 31 LATeral and 3 SUPerior views) volumes obtained in routine clinical care at two medical centers using the S2000 automated 3D breast ultrasound system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Manual pectoral muscle delineations of the anterior surface were provided by a trained researcher. We developed an algorithm to segment the pectoral muscle surface in ABUS volumes: First, the chest wall is segmented using a previously validated software that models the chest wall as a cylinder. Thereafter, the chest wall surface is used to perform a cylindrical transformation on the ABUS volume. By applying this transformation, the chest wall and the pectoral muscle are straightened and shape variability of the pectoral muscle across volumes can be encoded in a probabilistic atlas. In the last step, gradient and atlas information are used to guide the pectoral muscle surface segmentation in a dynamic programming approach. The algorithm was applied to the 74 ABUS volumes of the study dataset following a leave-one-out strategy. Distance (mean+-stdev) between manual and automated pectoral muscle surfaces was used as evaluation measure. RESULTS The presented approach achieved a mean surface distance error of 3.47+-3.03 mm, compared to the manual annotations. The surface distance error for AP, LAT, MED and SUP view volumes was 2.61+-4.15, 3.78+-4.15, 4.17+-2.37 and 3.78+-1.02 mm, respectively. CONCLUSION Automated pectoral muscle segmentation is challenging due to high variation in pectoral muscle anatomy. The proposed method shows promising results on segmenting the pectoral muscle surface. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION ABUS is a promising modality for screening but reading is time consuming for radiologists. Availability of supporting tools such as computer-aided detection may expedite introduction of ABUS in practice.},

Methods: We identified 40 patients that were diagnosed with breast cancer in MRI and had a prior MRI examination reported as negative available. In these prior examinations, 24 lesions could retrospectively be identified by two breast radiologists in consensus: 11 were scored as visible and 13 as minimally visible. Additionally, 120 normal scans were collected from 120 women without history of breast cancer or breast surgery participating in the same MRI screening program. A fully automated CAD system was applied to this dataset to detect malignant lesions.

Conclusions: A substantial proportion of cancers that were misinterpreted or overlooked in an MRI screening program was detected by a CAD system in prior-negative examinations. It has to be clarified with further studies if such a CAD system has an influence on the number of misinterpreted and overlooked cancers in clinical practice when results are given to a radiologist.},

In this study, we propose an automated system to, given the location in the ABUS volume being inspected (source), find the corresponding location in a target volume. The target volume can be a different view of the same study or the same view from a prior examination. The algorithm was evaluated using 118 linkages between suspicious abnormalities annotated in a dataset of ABUS images of 27 patients participating in a high risk screening program. The distance between the predicted location and the center of the annotated lesion in the target volume was computed for evaluation. The mean +- stdev and median distance error achieved by the presented algorithm for linkages between volumes of the same study was 7.75 +- 6.71 mm and 5.16 mm, respectively. The performance was 9.54 +- 7.87 and 8.00 mm (mean +- stdev and median) for linkages between volumes from current and prior examinations. The proposed approach has the potential to minimize user interaction for finding correspondences among ABUS volumes.},

  title = {Programmatically generating annotations for de-identification of clinical data},
  abstract = {Clinical records may contain protected health information (PHI) which are privacy sensitive information. It is important to annotate and replace PHI in unstructured medical records, before being able to share the data for other research purposes. Machine learning models are quick to implement and can achieve competitive results (micro-averaged F1-scores Dutch radiology dataset: 0.88 and English i2b2 dataset: 0.87). However, to develop machine learning models, we need training data. In this project, we applied weak supervision to annotate and collect training data for de-identification of medical records. It is essential to automate this process as manual annotation is a laborious and repetitive task. We used the two human annotated datasets, where we 'removed' the gold annotations to weakly tag PHI instances in medical records, where we unified the output labels using two different aggregation models: aggregation at the token level (Snorkel) and sequential labeling (Skweak). The output is then used to train a discriminative end model where we achieve competitive results on the Dutch dataset (micro-averaged F1 score: 0.76) whereas performance on the English dataset is suboptimal (micro-averaged F1-score: 0.49). The results indicate that on structured PHI tags we approach human annotated results, but more complicated entities still need more attention.},

DM increases the risk of developing TB and contributes to adverse TB treatment outcomes hence screening and integrated management for both diseases in high burden countries is suggested. Computer-Aided Detection for TB (CAD4TB) can potentially be used as triage tool in low resource settings to pre-screen individuals for Xpert MTB/RIF testing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and performance of CAD4TB software in people with diabetes (PWD) enrolled in a TB screening program in Karachi, Pakistan. A total of 694 individuals with a diagnosis of DM (of whom 31.1% were newly diagnosed) were screened with CAD4TB and simultaneously provided sputum for Xpert MTB/RIF testing. Of the 74 (10.7%) participants who had bacteriologically positive (MTB+) results on Xpert testing, 54 (73%) had a CAD4TB score >70; and 155 (25%) participants who tested MTB-negative had scores >70. The area under the receiver operator curve was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.77-0.80). Our study findings indicate that CAD4TB offers good diagnostic accuracy as a triage test for TB screening among PWD using Xpert MTB/RIF as the reference standard.},

  title = {Combining CT scans and clinical features for improved automated COVID-19 detection},
  abstract = {During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals in hard-hit regions were overflowing with patients at the emergency unit with respiratory complaints. Since the RT-PCR test was in limited supply at the time and test results took a long time to obtain, many hospitals opted to use chest CT scans of COVID-19 suspects.
    As a result of this, several studies examined the possibility of automating the detection of COVID-19 in CT scans. One such study, by Lessmann et al., 2020, developed a model to predict COVID-19 severity scores based on these chest CT scans. In this thesis, we extended their model in several ways to take into account additional clinical values (such as blood values, sex, and age) to predict either PCR outcomes or clinical diagnoses.
    Based on data from the Canisius-Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis (CWZ) hospital and Radboudumc hospitals, as well as the COVID-19 dataset by Ning et al., 2020, we found that integrating these two modalities can indeed lead to improved performance when both clinical and visual features are of sufficient quality. When training on data from the CWZ hospital and evaluating on data from the Radboudumc hospital, models using only clinical features or visual features achieved Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) values of 0.773 and 0.826, respectively; their combination resulted in an AUC of 0.851.
    Similarly, when training on data from the Union hospital in the iCTCF dataset and predicting on data from the Union hospital in that same dataset, we obtained AUCs of 0.687 and 0.812 for clinical and visual features, respectively; their combination resulted in an AUC of 0.862.
    However, we also discovered that the patterns of missing data present in these clinical feature datasets can play an essential role in the performance of the models fitted on them. We thus developed additional methods to analyze and mitigate this effect to obtain fairer evaluations and increase model generalizability. Still, the high diagnostic performance of some of our models suggests that they could be adapted into clinical practice, and our methods pertaining to missing data could be used to aid further research using clinical feature datasets.},

However, there is still an immense potential for performance improvement in mammogram breast cancer detection Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems by integrating all the information that radiologist utilizes, such as symmetry and temporal data. In this work, we proposed a patch based multi-input CNN that learns symmetrical difference to detect breast masses. The network was trained on a large-scale dataset of 28294 mammogram images. The performance was compared to a baseline architecture without symmetry context using Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and Competition Performance Metric (CPM). At candidate level, AUC value of 0.933 with 95% confidence interval of [0.920, 0.954] was obtained when symmetry information is incorporated in comparison with baseline architecture which yielded AUC value of 0.929 with [0.919, 0.947] confidence interval. By incorporating symmetrical information, although there was no a significant candidate level performance again (p=0.111), we have found a compelling result at exam level with CPM value of 0.733 (p=0.001). We believe that including temporal data, and adding benign class to the dataset could improve the detection performance.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer treatment depends on human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) status, which is often determined using dual probe fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Hereby, also loss and gain of the centromere of chromosome 17 (CEP17) can be observed (HER2 is located on chromosome 17). CEP17 gain can lead to difficulty in interpretation of HER2 status, since this might represent true polysomy. With this study we investigated whether isolated polysomy is present and how this effects HER2 status in six breast cancer cell lines and 97 breast cancer cases, using HER2 FISH and immunohistochemistry, DNA ploidy assessment and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification. We observed no isolated polysomy of chromosome 17 in any cell line. However, FISH analysis did show CEP17 gain in five of six cell lines, which reflected gains of the whole chromosome in metaphase spreads and aneuploidy with gain of multiple chromosomes in all these cases. In patients' samples, gain of CEP17 indeed correlated with aneuploidy of the tumour (91.1%; p < 0.001). Our results indicate that CEP17 gain is not due to isolated polysomy, but rather due to widespread aneuploidy with gain of multiple chromosomes. As aneuploidy is associated with poor clinical outcome, irrespective of tumour grade, this could improve future therapeutic decision making.},

  doi = {10.1594/ecr2018/C-1407},
  abstract = {Aims and objectives: Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide with 1.6 million deaths worldwide in 20121. Several large American institutions have recommended lung cancer screening with low dose CT chest in specific population groups2,3,4. If lung cancer screening was implemented in Scotland there would be a very large increase in requirement for chest CT scans. These would all need reported, increasing radiological workload and cost. We postulated that combining the use of computer aided detection (CAD) and analysis could safely exclude lung cancer in a large number of scans obviating the need for radiological review with associated resource savings. The hypothesis was that CAD would have a 100% negative predictive value for lung cancer screening. Methods and materials: The initial screening Chest CT scans from Glasgow patients enrolled within the prospective ECLS study5 were sent for Lung-RADs analysis by Diagnostic Image Analysis Group Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center. Computer aided detection was used to identify nodules and then categorise them into one of four groups (CAD 1 - 4) based upon probability of malignancy taking into account lesion morphology, size, location and texture. Independently and blind to the CAD results the scans were reported by two experienced consultant respiratory radiologists and assigned a similar grading category. The patient were then followed up with interval CT scans as per the ECLS study protocol. Results: CAD categorisation had a statistically significant correlation with the radiologist categorisation (p<0.001). None of the 113 (36%) patients within the CAD 1 group (no nodule identified) were found to have lung nodule(s). Conclusion: CAD and risk stratification is useful in excluding lung cancer on thoracic CT within the screening population. CAD followed by radiology review of suspicious cases is the cost effective and would lead to a 30% reduction in screening costs.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To retrospectively determine the relationship between apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) obtained with 3.0-T diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and Gleason grades in peripheral zone prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The requirement to obtain institutional review board approval was waived. Fifty-one patients with prostate cancer underwent MR imaging before prostatectomy, including DW MR imaging with b values of 0, 50, 500, and 800 sec/mm(2). In prostatectomy specimens, separate slice-by-slice determinations of Gleason grade groups were performed according to primary, secondary, and tertiary Gleason grades. In addition, tumors were classified into qualitative grade groups (low-, intermediate-, or high-grade tumors). ADC maps were aligned to step-sections and regions of interest annotated for each tumor slice. The median ADC of tumors was related to qualitative grade groups with linear mixed-model regression analysis. The accuracy of the median ADC in the most aggressive tumor component in the differentiation of low- from combined intermediate- and high-grade tumors was summarized by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (A(z)). RESULTS: In 51 prostatectomy specimens, 62 different tumors and 251 step-section tumor lesions were identified. The median ADC in the tumors showed a negative relationship with Gleason grade group, and differences among the three qualitative grade groups were statistically significant (P < .001). Overall, with an increase of one qualitative grade group, the median ADC (A-A?A 1/2 standard deviation) decreased 0.18 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec A-A?A 1/2  0.02. Low-, intermediate-, and high-grade tumors had a median ADC of 1.30 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec A-A?A 1/2  0.30, 1.07 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec A-A?A 1/2  0.30, and 0.94 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec A-A?A 1/2  0.30, respectively. ROC analysis showed a discriminatory performance of A(z) = 0.90 in discerning low-grade from combined intermediate- and high-grade lesions. CONCLUSION: ADCs at 3.0 T showed an inverse relationship to Gleason grades in peripheral zone prostate cancer. A high discriminatory performance was achieved in the differentiation of low-, intermediate-, and high-grade cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate pretreatment assessment of prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness is important in decision making. Gleason grade is a critical predictor of the aggressiveness of PCa. Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies (TRUSBxs) show substantial undergrading of Gleason grades found after radical prostatectomy (RP). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be a biomarker of tumour aggressiveness. OBJECTIVE: To improve pretreatment assessment of PCa aggressiveness, this study prospectively evaluated MRI-guided prostate biopsies (MR-GBs) of abnormalities determined on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. The results were compared with a 10-core TRUSBx cohort. RP findings served as the gold standard. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 10-core TRUSBx (n=64) or MR-GB (n=34) was used for PCa diagnosis before RP in 98 patients. MEASUREMENTS: Using multiparametric 3-T MRI: T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, and DWI were performed to identify tumour-suspicious regions in patients with a negative TRUSBx. The regions with the highest restriction on ADC maps within the suspicions regions were used to direct MR-GB. A 10-core TRUSBx was used in a matched cohort. Following RP, the highest Gleason grades (HGGs) in biopsies and RP specimens were identified. Biopsy and RP Gleason grade results were evaluated using chi-square analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: No significant differences on RP were observed for proportions of patients having a HGG of 3 (35\% vs 28\%; p=0.50), 4 (32\% vs 41\%; p=0.51), and 5 (32\% vs 31\%; p=0.61) for the MR-GB and TRUSBx cohort, respectively. MR-GB showed an exact performance with RP for overall HGG: 88\% (30 of 34); for TRUS-GB it was 55\% (35 of 64; p=0.001). In the MR-GB cohort, an exact performance with HGG 3 was 100\% (12 of 12); for HGG 4, 91\% (10 of 11); and for HGG 5, 73\% (8 of 11). The corresponding performance rates for TRUSBx were 94\% (17 of 18; p=0.41), 46\% (12 of 26; p=0.02), and 30\% (6 of 20; p=0.01), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows prospectively that DWI-directed MR-GBs significantly improve pretreatment risk stratification by obtaining biopsies that are representative of true Gleason grade.},

Retrospectively, 34 patients were included who had prostate cancer and had undergone multiparametric MR imaging, including T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR imaging prior to radical prostatectomy. Six radiologists less experienced in prostate imaging and four radiologists experienced in prostate imaging were asked to characterize different regions suspicious for cancer as benign or malignant on multiparametric MR images first without and subsequently with CAD software. The effect of CAD was analyzed by using a multiple-reader, multicase, receiver operating characteristic analysis and a linear mixed-model analysis.Results:In 34 patients, 206 preannotated regions, including 67 malignant and 64 benign regions in the peripheral zone (PZ) and 19 malignant and 56 benign regions in the transition zone (TZ), were evaluated. Stand-alone CAD had an overall area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.90. For PZ and TZ lesions, the AUCs were 0.92 and 0.87, respectively. Without CAD, less-experienced observers had an overall AUC of 0.81, which significantly increased to 0.91 (P = .001) with CAD. For experienced observers, the AUC without CAD was 0.88, which increased to 0.91 (P = .17) with CAD. For PZ lesions, less-experienced observers increased their AUC from 0.86 to 0.95 (P < .001) with CAD. Experienced observers showed an increase from 0.91 to 0.93 (P = .13). For TZ lesions, less-experienced observers significantly increased their performance from 0.72 to 0.79 (P = .01) with CAD and experienced observers increased their performance from 0.81 to 0.82 (P = .42).Conclusion:Addition of CAD significantly improved the performance of less-experienced observers in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions; when less-experienced observers used CAD, they reached similar performance as experienced observers. The stand-alone performance of CAD was similar to performance of experienced observers.A,A(c) RSNA, 2012Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12111634/-/DC1.},

  abstract = {The distensibility of a blood vessel is a marker of atherosclerotic disease. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of measuring carotid artery distensibility on 4D CTA, both manually and using a new automatic method. On 4D CTA datasets manual (n=38) and automatic (n=76) measurements of the carotid distensibility were performed. A subset (n=10) of the manual annotations were repeated by a second observer. The interobserver variability was assessed using a Bland-Altman analysis and appeared to be too large to reliably measure the distensibility using manual annotation. We compared two versions of the automatic method: one using 3D registration and one using a 4D registration method. The latter resulted in a more smooth deformation over time. The automatic method was evaluated using a synthetic deformation and by investigating whether known relations with cardiovascular risk factors could be reproduced. The relation between distensibility and cardiovascular risk factors was tested with a Mann-Whitney U test. Automatic measurements revealed an association with hypertension whereas the manual measurements did not. This relation has been found by other studies too. We conclude that carotid artery distensibility measurements should be performed automatically and that the method described in this paper is suitable for that. All CTA datasets and related clinical data used in this study can be downloaded from our website (http://ctadist.bigr.nlhttp://ctadist.bigr.nl).},

  abstract = {Objectives: DISH has been associated with increased coronary artery calcifications and incident ischaemic stroke. The formation of bone along the spine may share pathways with calcium deposition in the aorta. We hypothesized that patients with DISH have increased vascular calcifications. Therefore we aimed to investigate the presence and extent of DISH in relation to thoracic aortic calcification (TAC) severity.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included 4703 patients from the Second Manifestation of ARTerial disease cohort, consisting of patients with cardiovascular events or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Chest radiographs were scored for DISH using the Resnick criteria. Different severities of TAC were scored arbitrarily from no TAC to mild, moderate or severe TAC. Using multivariate logistic regression, the associations between DISH and TAC were analysed with adjustments for age, sex, BMI, diabetes, smoking status, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, cholesterol lowering drug usage, renal function and blood pressure.
   Results: A total of 442 patients (9.4\%) had evidence of DISH and 1789 (38\%) patients had TAC. The prevalence of DISH increased from 6.6\% in the no TAC group to 10.8\% in the mild, 14.3\% in the moderate and 17.1\% in the severe TAC group. After adjustments, DISH was significantly associated with the presence of TAC [odds ratio (OR) 1.46 [95\% CI 1.17, 1.82)]. In multinomial analyses, DISH was associated with moderate TAC [OR 1.43 (95\% CI 1.06, 1.93)] and severe TAC [OR 1.67 (95\% CI 1.19, 2.36)].
   Conclusions: Subjects with DISH have increased TACs, providing further evidence that patients with DISH have an increased burden of vascular calcifications.},

  abstract = {Background: Development of adult respiratory disease is influenced by events in childhood. The impact of childhood pneumonia on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not well defined. We hypothesize that childhood pneumonia is a risk factor for reduced lung function and COPD in adult smokers. Methods: COPD cases and control smokers between 45-80 years old from the United States COPD Gene Study were included. Childhood pneumonia was defined by self-report of pneumonia at <16 years. Subjects with lung disease other than COPD or asthma were excluded. Smokers with and without childhood pneumonia were compared on measures of respiratory disease, lung function, and quantitative analysis of chest CT scans. Results: Of 10,192 adult smokers, 854 (8.4 %) reported pneumonia in childhood. Childhood pneumonia was associated with COPD (OR 1.40; 95 % CI 1.17-1.66), chronic bronchitis, increased COPD exacerbations, and lower lung function: post-bronchodilator FEV1(69.1 vs. 77.1 % predicted), FVC (82.7 vs. 87.4 % predicted), FEV1/FVCratio (0.63 vs. 0.67;p< 0.001 for all comparisons). Childhood pneumonia was associated with increased airway wall thickness on CT, without significant difference in emphysema. Having both pneumonia and asthma in childhood further increased the risk of developing COPD (OR 1.85; 95 % CI 1.10-3.18). Conclusions: Children with pneumonia are at increased risk for future smoking-related lung disease including COPD and decreased lung function. This association is supported by airway changes on chest CT scans. Childhood pneumonia may be an important factor in the early origins of COPD, and the combination ofpneumonia and asthma in childhood may pose the greatest risk.

  abstract = {Childhood asthma is strongly influenced by genetics and is a risk factor for reduced lung function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. This study investigates self-reported childhood asthma in adult smokers from the COPDGene Study. We hypothesize that childhood asthma is associated with decreased lung function, increased risk for COPD, and that a genome-wide association study (GWAS) will show association with established asthma variants. We evaluated current and former smokers ages 45-80 of non-Hispanic white (NHW) or African American (AA) race. Childhood asthma was defined by self-report of asthma, diagnosed by a medical professional, with onset at < 16 years or during childhood. Subjects with a history of childhood asthma were compared to those who never had asthma based on lung function, development of COPD, and genetic variation. GWAS was performed in NHW and AA populations, and combined in meta-analysis. Two sets of established asthma SNPs from published literature were examined for association with childhood asthma. Among 10,199 adult smokers, 730 (7%) reported childhood asthma and 7493 (73%) reported no history of asthma. Childhood asthmatics had reduced lung function and increased risk for COPD (OR 3.42, 95% CI 2.81-4.18). Genotype data was assessed for 8031 subjects. Among NHWs, 391(7%) had childhood asthma, and GWAS identified one genome-wide significant association in KIAA1958 (rs59289606, p = 4.82 x 10 ). Among AAs, 339 (12%) had childhood asthma. No SNPs reached genome-wide significance in the AAs or in the meta-analysis combining NHW and AA subjects; however, potential regions of interest were identified. Established asthma SNPs were examined, seven from the NHGRI-EBI database and five with genome-wide significance in the largest pediatric asthma GWAS. Associations were found in the current childhood asthma GWAS with known asthma loci in IL1RL1, IL13, LINC01149, near GSDMB, and in the C11orf30-LRRC32 region (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Childhood asthmatics are at increased risk for COPD. Defining asthma by self-report is valid in populations at risk for COPD, identifying subjects with clinical and genetic characteristics known to associate with childhood asthma. This has potential to improve clinical understanding of asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) and enhance future research into ACO-specific treatment regimens.

  abstract = {Several prediction models for progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have been developed, but the added value of using genetic information in those models in addition to clinical characteristics is ambiguous. In this prospective cohort study, we explored the added value of genetics using a genetic risk score (GRS) based on 52 AMD-associated variants, in addition to the clinical severity grading at baseline as quantified by validated drusen detection software, to predict disease progression in 177 AMD patients after 6.5 years follow-up. The GRS was strongly associated with the drusen coverage at baseline (P < 0.001) and both the GRS and drusen coverage were associated with disease progression. When the GRS was added as predictor in addition to the drusen coverage, R  increased from 0.46 to 0.56. This improvement by the GRS was predominantly seen in patients with a drusen coverage <15%. In patients with a larger drusen coverage, the GRS had less added value to predict progression. Thus, genetic information has added value over clinical characteristics in predicting disease progression in AMD, but only in patients with a less severe disease stage. Patients with a high GRS should be made aware of their risk and could be selected for clinical trials for arresting progression.},

Today, these images are all in digital format and processed by various types of software for optimal display during radiological analysis. As a result of continuous quality control on national public health screening for breast cancer, approximately 1000 cases of interval carcinoma and any T2 tumours identified during this screening are re-assessed. The results of these retrospective analyses suggest that there is room for improvement in terms of the reliability of screening mammography without this resulting in an excessive increase of false positive results. Research has shown that the more radiological evaluators are involved, the better the results. Alternatively, a computer can be utilised for detecting abnormalities. Large-scale use of Computer-Assisted Detection (CAD) is already underway in some countries. For this reason, the option of adding CAD to the current practice of double assessment of mammograms could be considered a sensible option for the future.},

  title = {Trends in the Incidence of Pulmonary Nodules in Chest Computed Tomography: 10-Year Results from Two Dutch Hospitals},
  doi = {10.26044/ecr2021/C-11494},
  abstract = {Purpose: To study trends in the incidence of reported pulmonary nodules in chest computed tomography (CT) since 2008. Methods: We retrospectively collected the radiology reports from chest CT studies performed between 2008 and 2019 from the hospital information systems of two large Dutch hospitals. Cases were included between 2008 and 2017; two years served as follow-up. A natural language processing algorithm was used to identify studies with any reported pulmonary nodule measuring up to 3 cm in diameter. Results: Between 2008 and 2017, a total of 68,656 patients underwent 142,111 chest CT examinations at both hospitals combined. The number of annual chest CT scans increased from 11,315 in 7,861 patients to 18,511 in 12,565 patients during this period, an increase of 64%. The percentage of patients, in whom nodules were reported, increased from 33% (2,605 individuals) in 2008 to 50% (6,253 individuals) in 2017. The proportion of these patients who received a follow-up chest CT increased from 911/2,605 (35%) to 2,792/6,253 (45%). The average number of follow-up scans per patient remained similar (1.58 in 2008; 1.64 in 2017). Conclusion: The number of patients who underwent chest CT examinations substantially increased over the past decade. The proportion of patients in whom a pulmonary nodule has been found significantly increased, as did the percentage of those who received follow-up CT. These findings underline that effective nodule management becomes an increasingly important public health issue. Limitations: CT scans that only contain portions of the lungs (e.g. abdominal CT) were not included. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the medical ethical review boards of both institutions.

Materials and Methods: At two hospitals (Hospitals A and B), three datasets consisting of conventional hand, wrist, and scaphoid radiographs were retrospectively retrieved: a dataset of 1039 radiographs (775 patients [mean age, 48 +- 23 years; 505 females], period: 2017--2019, Hospitals A and B) for developing a scaphoid segmentation CNN, a dataset of 3000 radiographs (1846 patients [mean age, 42 +- 22 years; 937 females], period: 2003--2019, Hospital B) for developing a scaphoid fracture detection CNN, and a dataset of 190 radiographs (190 patients [mean age, 43 +- 20 years; 77 female] period: 2011--2020, Hospital A) for testing the complete fracture detection system. Both CNNs were applied consecutively: the segmentation CNN localized the scaphoid and then passed the relevant region to the detection CNN for fracture detection. In an observer study, the performance of the system was compared with 11 radiologists. Evaluation metrics included the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The segmentation CNN achieved a DSC of 97.4% +- 1.4 with an HD of 1.31 mm +- 1.03. The detection CNN had a sensitivity of 78% (95% CI: 70, 86), specificity of 84% (95% CI: 77, 92), PPV of 83% (95% CI: 77, 90), and AUC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.91). There was no difference between the AUC of the CNN and the radiologists (0.87 [95% CI: 0.81, 0.91] versus 0.83 [radiologist range: 0.78-0.85]; P = .09). Conclusion: The developed CNN achieved radiologist-level performance in detecting scaphoid fractures on conventional radiographs of the hand, wrist, and scaphoid.},

Previous work has either focused on replacing the iterative optimization of distance and smoothness terms with CNN-layers or using supervised approaches driven by labels. Our method is the first to combine the complementary strengths of global semantic information (represented by segmentation labels) and local distance metrics that help align surrounding structures. We demonstrate significant higher Dice scores (of 86.5%) for deformable cardiac image registration compared to classic registration (79.0%) as well as label-driven deep learning frameworks (83.4%).},

  abstract = {We present a novel multilevel approach for deep learning based image registration. Recently published deep learning based registration methods have shown promising results for a wide range of tasks. However, these algorithms are still limited to relatively small deformations. Our method addresses this shortcoming by introducing a multilevel framework, which computes deformation fields on different scales, similar to conventional methods. Thereby, a coarse-level alignment is obtained first, which is subsequently improved on finer levels. We demonstrate our method on the complex task of inhale-to-exhale lung registration. We show that the use of a deep learning multilevel approach leads to significantly better registration results.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Despite its potential for improvements through supervision, deep learning-based registration approaches are difficult to train for large deformations in 3D scans due to excessive memory requirements. METHODS: We propose a new 2.5D convolutional transformer architecture that enables us to learn a memory-efficient weakly supervised deep learning model for multi-modal image registration. Furthermore, we firstly integrate a volume change control term into the loss function of a deep learning-based registration method to penalize occurring foldings inside the deformation field. RESULTS: Our approach succeeds at learning large deformations across multi-modal images. We evaluate our approach on 100 pair-wise registrations of CT and MRI whole-heart scans and demonstrate considerably higher Dice Scores (of 0.74) compared to a state-of-the-art unsupervised discrete registration framework (deeds with Dice of 0.71). CONCLUSION: Our proposed memory-efficient registration method performs better than state-of-the-art conventional registration methods. By using a volume change control term in the loss function, the number of occurring foldings can be considerably reduced on new registration cases.},

  abstract = {Image registration is the process of aligning two or more images to achieve point-wise spatial correspondence. Typically, image registration is phrased as an optimization problem w.r.t. a spatial mapping that minimizes a suitable cost function and common approaches estimate solutions by applying iterative optimization schemes such as gradient descent or Newton-type methods. This optimization is performed independently for each pair of images, which can be time consuming. In this paper we present an unsupervised learning-based approach for deformable image registration of thoracic CT scans. Our experiments show that our method performs comparable to conventional image registration methods and in particular is able to deal with large motions. Registration of a new unseen pair of images only requires a single forward pass through the network yielding the desired deformation field in less than 0.2 seconds. Furthermore, as a novelty in the context of deep-learning-based registration, we use the edge-based normalized gradient fields distance measure together with the curvature regularization as a loss function of the registration network.},

  abstract = {Image registration is a fundamental medical image analysis task, and a wide variety of approaches have been proposed. However, only a few studies have comprehensively compared medical image registration approaches on a wide range of clinically relevant tasks, in part because of the   lack of availability of such diverse data. This limits the development of registration methods, the adoption of research advances into practice, and a fair benchmark across competing approaches. The Learn2Reg challenge addresses these limitations by providing a multi-task medical image registration benchmark for comprehensive characterisation of deformable registration algorithms. A continuous evaluation will be possible at \url{https://learn2reg.grand-challenge.org}.
       Learn2Reg covers a wide range of anatomies (brain, abdomen, and thorax), modalities (ultrasound, CT, MR), availability of annotations, as well as intra- and inter-patient registration evaluation. We established an easily accessible framework for training and validation of 3D registration methods, which enabled the compilation of results of over 65 individual method submissions from more than 20 unique teams. We used a complementary set of metrics, including robustness, accuracy, plausibility, and runtime, enabling unique insight into the current state-of-the-art of medical image registration. This paper describes datasets, tasks, evaluation methods and results of the challenge, and the results of further analysis of transferability to new datasets, the importance of label supervision, and resulting bias.},

  abstract = {Deep-learning-based registration methods emerged as a fast alternative to conventional registration methods. However, these methods often still cannot achieve the same performance as conventional registration methods because they are either limited to small deformation or they fail to handle a superposition of large and small deformations without producing implausible deformation fields with foldings inside. In this paper, we identify important strategies of conventional registration methods for lung registration and successfully developed the deep-learning counterpart. We employ a Gaussian-pyramid-based multilevel framework that can solve the image registration optimization in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Furthermore, we prevent foldings of the deformation field and restrict the determinant of the Jacobian to physiologically meaningful values by combining a volume change penalty with a curvature regularizer in the loss function. Keypoint correspondences are integrated to focus on the alignment of smaller structures. We perform an extensive evaluation to assess the accuracy, the robustness, the plausibility of the estimated deformation fields, and the transferability of our registration approach. We show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on the COPDGene dataset compared to conventional registration method with much shorter execution time. In our experiments on the DIRLab exhale to inhale lung registration, we demonstrate substantial improvements (TRE below 1.2 mm) over other deep learning methods.},

  abstract = {Research into cancer biomarkers often comprises testing of a number of potentially relevant markers in tissue sections. Use of single antibody immunohistochemistry, however, limits the amount of information available from the analysis. One single component can be visualized at a time, prohibiting the simultaneous assessment of multiple markers. Immunofluorescence is a widely used alternative, enabling two or three simultaneous markers. In, for instance, the study of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes one may wish to use multiplex immunophenotyping to identify the relevant subtypes of T-cells. This may require more than three markers in a single section. Also, because of availability, it is not always possible to compile panels of markers raised in different species to prevent cross-reactivity.
                             This workshop will focus on highly multiplexed imaging, allowing up to 7 markers in a single section. The method comprises a staining procedure consisting of consecutive steps of IHC staining with tyramid signal amplification and microwave stripping of the antibody. Every antibody is labeled with a different fluorescent dye. Subsequent imaging is performed using a fully automated multispectral imaging setup. This approach enables the use of antibodies raised in the same species (e.g. mouse MAbs) and is capable of eliminating the effect of autofluorescence. The workshop will consist of two parts. First the specific staining techniques will be treated. In the second part we will focus on the imaging and analysis options. There will be ample opportunities for questions and discussion.},

  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Objective: Histopathological analysis of renal biopsies depends on the identification and assessment of specific histological structures. Both in research and routine diagnostics, this analysis can be time-consuming and suffer from observer variability. Recently, it has been shown that the combination of high resolution whole slide imaging (WSI) and artificial intelligence yields powerful new avenues for tissue section analysis. This study aims to develop an algorithm based on a specific type of artificial intelligence (a convolutional neural network; CNN) to fully automatically segment structures in cortical fragments of renal allograft biopsies. Automated segmentation of renal tissue allows an unbiased, reproducible computation of morphological characteristics of important structures. This in turn can be used as support in diagnostic quantitative measure-based decisions as for instance is employed in the Banff-classification. Methods: The neural network was trained using a set of Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stained slides (n=26) of renal allograft biopsies. WSIs were produced using a 3DHISTECH Pannoramic 250 Flash II digital slide scanner with a 20x objective lens. We used a U-net architecture CNN, which has been proven to be specifically useful in biomedical image segmentation tasks. Training was based on exhaustive annotations in one to two randomly selected rectangular areas per WSI (size approximately 3000 x 4000 pixels; comparable to one 200x microscopic field of view). A total of nine classes were annotated: Glomeruli, Sclerotic glomeruli, Proximal tubuli, Distal tubuli, Atrophic tubuli, Undefined tubuli, Arteries, Capsule and Interstitium. All annotations were revised by a pathology resident (JK), under consultation of an experienced nephropathologist (ES). Our CNN was evaluated using the Dice coefficient for each individual class. This coefficient expresses the quality of the segmentation on a scale ranging from 0-1, taking into account both recall and precision. Because of the limited amount of annotations for certain classes, cross-validation was applied. Results: We found the following Dice coefficients for the different histological segments: Glomeruli: 0.89, Sclerotic glomeruli: 0.43, Proximal tubuli: 0.88, Distal tubuli: 0.77, Atrophic tubuli: 0.32, Undefined tubuli: 0.11, Arteries: 0.71, Capsule: 0.47 and Interstitium: 0.85. Conclusion: This study shows that segmentation of WSIs of PAS-stained renal allograft biopsies using a CNN is feasible. Segmentation of several important classes (Glomeruli, Interstitium, Arteries, Proximal-, and Distal tubuli) was highly accurate. CNNs learn from being exposed to many example images. The most probable reason for the lower performance for the other classes are the relatively low number of annotated regions for these classes, combined with a high level of variability inherently present in these tissue structures. To our knowledge, this is the first time artificial intelligence is being deployed in a nine-class segmentation task in the field of kidney transplant histopathology. Results of this study show the promising potential of CNNs in obtaining quantitative, spatial and morphometric information from renal tissue in an objective, reproducible, high-scale fashion supporting diagnostic decisions based on quantitative measures.},

  booktitle = {Dutch Federation of Nephrology (NfN) Fall Symposium},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Objective: Glomeruli are among the most extensively studied components in kidney histopathology. Researchers and clinicians often depend on quantitative measures for the assessment of glomeruli. Historically, these are obtained through manual counting or classical image processing techniques. These methods possess limited reproducibility, are insufficiently robust to inter-laboratory variations, and are infamous for their tedious nature. As an alternative, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect, segment, and count healthy and sclerotic glomeruli in digitized Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stained tissue sections. Methods: A CNN was trained using exhaustively annotated structures in rectangular regions in 50 whole-slide images (WSIs) of renal transplant biopsies. This resulted in annotations of 182 healthy and 18 sclerotic glomeruli. 40 WSIs were used for training and validation. Segmentation was assessed by calculating the Dice-coefficient on an unseen test set of 10 WSIs. To assess the network's ability to detect glomeruli in a larger composition of varying structures, we applied the CNN to 15 fully annotated nephrectomy WSIs. We calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients for glomerular counting (healthy and sclerotic glomeruli combined) in 82 renal transplant biopsies manually performed by three renal pathologists and the quantification by the CNN. Results: We found a Dice-coefficient of 0.95 for healthy glomeruli and 0.62 for sclerotic glomeruli in the renal transplant biopsy test set. The CNN detected 93.4% of 1747 annotated healthy glomeruli in the nephrectomy samples, with 8.4% false positives. The CNN detected 76.4% of 72 annotated sclerotic glomeruli, with 45.5% false positives. Pearson's correlation coefficient for glomerular counting on 82 transplant biopsies of the CNN versus the pathologists was 0.924, 0.930 and 0.937 for pathologist 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The CNN counted on average 1.7 glomeruli more than the pathologists. The pathologists differed on average 0.78 glomerulus. Conclusion: The network can accurately detect and segment healthy glomeruli. The CNN performs moderately well on segmenting sclerotic glomeruli, most probably due to the low amount of training data that was available for this class. The CNN's higher glomerular count can partly be explained by possible false positive detections of sclerotic glomeruli. Also, partially sampled glomeruli located at biopsy's edges are not counted by the pathologist, while they are included by the network. More training data for sclerotic glomeruli and additional post-processing techniques are needed to resolve this.},

  abstract = {Delayed graft function (DGF) is a strong risk factor for development of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) in kidney transplants. Quantitative assessment of inflammatory infiltrates in kidney biopsies of DGF patients can reveal predictive markers for IFTA development. In this study, we combined multiplex tyramide signal amplification (mTSA) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to assess the inflammatory microenvironment in kidney biopsies of DGF patients (n=22) taken at six weeks post-transplantation. Patients were stratified for IFTA development (<10 % versus >=10%) from six weeks to six months post-transplantation, based on histopathological assessment by three kidney pathologists. One mTSA panel was developed for visualization of capillaries, T- and B-lymphocytes and macrophages and a second mTSA panel for T-helper cell and macrophage subsets. The slides were multi-spectrally imaged and custom-made python scripts enabled conversion to artificial brightfield whole-slide images (WSI). We used an existing CNN for the detection of lymphocytes with cytoplasmatic staining patterns in immunohistochemistry and developed two new CNNs for the detection of macrophages and nuclear-stained lymphocytes. F1-scores were 0.77 (nuclear-stained lymphocytes), 0.81 (cytoplasmatic-stained lymphocytes), and 0.82 (macrophages) on a test set of artificial brightfield WSI. The CNNs were used to detect inflammatory cells, after which we assessed the peritubular capillary extent, cell density, cell ratios and cell distance in the two patient groups. In this cohort, distance of macrophages to other immune cells and peritubular capillary extent did not vary significantly at six weeks post-transplantation between patient groups. CD163+ cell density was higher in patients with >=10% IFTA development six months post-transplantation (p<0.05). CD3+CD8-/CD3+CD8+ ratios were higher in patients with <10% IFTA development (p<0.05). We observed a high correlation between CD163+ and CD4+GATA3+ cell density (R=0.74, p<0.001). Our study demonstrates that CNNs can be used to leverage reliable, quantitative results from mTSA-stained, multi-spectrally imaged slides of kidney transplant biopsies.},

  abstract = {In kidney transplant biopsies, both inflammation and chronic changes are important features that predict long-term graft survival. Quantitative scoring of these features is important for transplant diagnostics and kidney research. However, visual scoring is poorly reproducible and labor-intensive. The goal of this study was to investigate the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to quantify inflammation and chronic features in kidney transplant biopsies.
   A structure segmentation CNN and a lymphocyte detection CNN were applied on 125 whole-slide image pairs of PAS-, and CD3-stained slides. The CNN results were used to quantify healthy and sclerotic glomeruli, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and inflammation both within non-atrophic and atrophic tubuli, and in areas of interstitial fibrosis. The computed tissue features showed high correlations with Banff lesion scores of five pathologists. Analyses on a small subset showed a moderate correlation towards higher CD3+ cell density within scarred regions and higher CD3+ cell count inside atrophic tubuli correlated with long-term change of estimated glomerular filtration rate.
   The presented CNNs are valid tools to yield objective quantitative information on glomeruli number, fibrotic tissue, and inflammation within scarred and non-scarred kidney parenchyma in a reproducible fashion. CNNs have the potential to improve kidney transplant diagnostics and will benefit the community as a novel method to generate surrogate endpoints for large-scale clinical studies.},

  abstract = {Brain micro-bleeds (BMBs) are used as surrogate markers for detecting diffuse axonal injury in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. The location and number of BMBs have been shown to influence the long-term outcome of TBI. To further study the importance of BMBs for prognosis, accurate localization and quantification are required. The task of annotating BMBs is laborious, complex and prone to error, resulting in a high inter- and intra-reader variability. In this paper we propose a computer-aided detection (CAD) system to automatically detect BMBs in MRI scans of moderate to severe neuro-trauma patients. Our method consists of four steps. Step one: preprocessing of the data. Both susceptibility (SWI) and T1 weighted MRI scans are used. The images are co-registered, a brain-mask is generated, the bias field is corrected, and the image intensities are normalized. Step two: initial candidates for BMBs are selected as local minima in the processed SWI scans. Step three: feature extraction. BMBs appear as round or ovoid signal hypo-intensities on SWI. Twelve features are computed to capture these properties of a BMB. Step four: Classification. To identify BMBs from the set of local minima using their features, different classifiers are trained on a database of 33 expert annotated scans and 18 healthy subjects with no BMBs. Our system uses a leave-one-out strategy to analyze its performance. With a sensitivity of 90% and 1.3 false positives per BMB, our CAD system shows superior results compared to state-of-the-art BMB detection algorithms (developed for non-trauma patients).},

  abstract = {In this paper a Computer Aided Detection (CAD) system is presented to automatically detect Cerebral Microbleeds (CMBs) in patients with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). It is believed that the presence of CMBs has clinical prognostic value in TBI patients. To study the contribution of CMBs in patient outcome, accurate detection of CMBs is required. Manual detection of CMBs in TBI patients is a time consuming task that is prone to errors, because CMBs are easily overlooked and are difficult to distinguish from blood vessels.

                             This study included 33 TBI patients. Because of the laborious nature of manually annotating CMBs, only one trained expert manually annotated the CMBs in all 33 patients. A subset of ten TBI patients was annotated by six experts. Our CAD system makes use of both Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI) and T1 weighted magnetic resonance images to detect CMBs. After pre-processing these images, a two-step approach was used for automated detection of CMBs. In the first step, each voxel was characterized by twelve features based on the dark and spherical nature of CMBs and a random forest classifier was used to identify CMB candidate locations. In the second step, segmentations were made from each identified candidate location. Subsequently an object-based classifier was used to remove false positive detections of the voxel classifier, by considering seven object-based features that discriminate between spherical objects (CMBs) and elongated objects (blood vessels). A guided user interface was designed for fast evaluation of the CAD system result. During this process, an expert checked each CMB detected by the CAD system.

                             A Fleiss' kappa value of only 0.24 showed that the inter-observer variability for the TBI patients in this study was very large. An expert using the guided user interface reached an average sensitivity of 93%, which was significantly higher (p = 0.03) than the average sensitivity of 77% (sd 12.4%) that the six experts manually detected. Furthermore, with the use of this CAD system the reading time was substantially reduced from one hour to 13 minutes per patient, because the CAD system only detects on average 25.9 false positives per TBI patient, resulting in 0.29 false positives per definite CMB finding.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, 99% of all maternal deaths occur in low-resource countries. Ultrasound imaging can be used to detect maternal risk factors, but requires a well-trained sonographer to obtain the biometric parameters of the fetus. One of the most important biometric parameters is the fetal Head Circumference (HC). The HC can be used to estimate the Gestational Age (GA) and assess the growth of the fetus. In this paper we propose a method to estimate the fetal HC with the use of the Obstetric Sweep Protocol (OSP). With the OSP the abdomen of pregnant women is imaged with the use of sweeps. These sweeps can be taught to somebody without any prior knowledge of ultrasound within a day.
                             Both the OSP and the standard two-dimensional ultrasound image for HC assessment were acquired by an experienced gynecologist from fifty pregnant women in St. Luke's Hospital in Wolisso, Ethiopia. The reference HC from the standard two-dimensional ultrasound image was compared to both the manually measured HC and the automatically measured HC from the OSP data.
                             The median difference between the estimated GA from the manual measured HC using the OSP and the reference standard was -1.1 days (Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) 7.7 days). The median difference between the estimated GA from the automatically measured HC using the OSP and the reference standard was -6.2 days (MAD 8.6 days).
                             Therefore, it can be concluded that it is possible to estimate the fetal GA with simple obstetric sweeps with a deviation of only one week.},

  abstract = {Objective: In this paper, we present the design of low-cost medical ultrasound scanners aimed at the detection of maternal mortality risk factors in developing countries. Method: Modern ultrasound scanners typically employ a high element count transducer array with multichannel transmit and receive electronics. To minimize hardware costs, we employ a single piezoelectric element, mechanically swept across the target scene, and a highly cost-engineered single channel acquisition circuit. Given this constraint, we compare the achievable image quality of a monostatic fixed focus scanner (MFFS) with a monostatic synthetic aperture scanner (MSAS) using postfocusing. Quantitative analysis of image quality was carried out using simulation and phantom experiments, which were used to compare a proof-of-concept MSAS prototype with an MFFS device currently available on the market. Finally, in vivo experiments were performed to validate the MSAS prototype in obstetric imaging. Results: Simulations show that the achievable lateral resolution of the MSAS approach is superior at all ranges compared to the fixed focus approach. Phantom experiments verify the improved resolution of the MSAS prototype but reveal a lower signal to noise ratio. In vivo experiments show promising results using the MSAS for clinical diagnostics in prenatal care. Conclusion: The proposed MSAS achieves superior resolution but lower SNR compared to an MFFS approach, principally due to lower acoustic energy emitted. Significance: The production costs of the proposed MSAS could be an order of magnitude lower than any other ultrasound system on the market today, bringing affordable obstetric imaging a step closer for developing countries.},

Three low-cost ultrasound devices were compared to one high-end ultrasound device. GA was estimated with the head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC) and femur length (FL) using both the standard plane and the OSP. The results revealed that the HC, AC and FL can be used to estimate GA using low-cost ultrasound devices in the standard plane within the inter-observer variability presented in literature. The OSP can be used to estimate the GA by measuring the HC and the AC, but not the FL. This study shows that it is feasible to estimate GA in resource-limited countries with low-cost ultrasound devices using the OSP. This makes it possible to estimate GA and assess fetal growth for pregnant women in rural areas of resource-limited countries.},

The HC can be used to estimate the gestational age and monitor growth of the fetus. Automated HC assessment could be valuable in developing countries, where there is a severe shortage of trained sonographers. The CAD system consists of two steps: First, Haar-like features were computed from the ultrasound images to train a random forest classifier to locate the fetal skull. Secondly, the HC was extracted using Hough transform, dynamic programming and an ellipse fit. The CAD system was trained on 999 images and validated on an independent test set of 335 images from all trimesters. The test set was manually annotated by an experienced sonographer and a medical researcher. The reference gestational age (GA) was estimated using the crown-rump length measurement (CRL). The mean difference between the reference GA and the GA estimated by the experienced sonographer was 0.8 +- 2.6, -0.0 +- 4.6 and 1.9 +- 11.0 days for the first, second and third trimester, respectively. The mean difference between the reference GA and the GA estimated by the medical researcher was 1.6 +- 2.7, 2.0 +- 4.8 and 3.9 +- 13.7 days. The mean difference between the reference GA and the GA estimated by the CAD system was 0.6 +- 4.3, 0.4 +- 4.7 and 2.5 +- 12.4 days. The results show that the CAD system performs comparable to an experienced sonographer. The presented system shows similar or superior results compared to systems published in literature. This is the first automated system for HC assessment evaluated on a large test set which contained data of all trimesters of the pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, 99% of all maternal deaths occur in developing countries. Ultrasound can be used
                             to detect maternal risk factors, but this technique is rarely used in developing countries
                             because it is too expensive, and it requires a trained sonographer to acquire and interpret the
                             ultrasound images. In this work we use a low-cost ultrasound device which was combined
                             with the obstetric sweep protocol (OSP) and deep learning algorithms to automatically detect
                             maternal risk factors. The OSP can be taught to any health care worker without prior
                             knowledge of ultrasound within one day, so there is no need for a trained sonographer.
                             The OSP was acquired from 318 pregnant women using the low-cost MicrUs (Telemed
                             Ultrasound Medical Systems, Milan, Italy) in Ethiopia. Two deep learning networks and two
                             random forest classifiers were trained to automatically detect twin pregnancies, estimate
                             gestational age (GA) and determine fetal presentation. The first deep learning network
                             performs a frame classification, which was used to automatically separate the six sweeps of
                             the OSP and automatically detect the fetal head and torso. The second deep learning network
                             was trained to measure the fetal head circumference (HC) using all frames in which the first
                             deep learning system detected the fetal head. The HC was used to determine the GA. Two
                             random forest classifiers were trained to detect twin pregnancies and determine fetal
                             presentation using the frame classification of the first deep learning network.
                             The developed algorithm can automatically estimate the GA with an interquartile range of
                             15.2 days, correctly detected 61% of all twins with a specificity of 99%, and correctly detect
                             all 31 breech presentations and 215 of the 216 cephalic presentations. The developed
                             algorithm can be computed in less than two seconds, making real-time application feasible.
                             The presented system is able to determine three maternal risk factors using the OSP. The OSP
                             can be acquired without the need of a trained sonographer, which makes widespread obstetric
                             ultrasound affordable and fast to implement in resource-limited settings. This makes is
                             possible to refer pregnant women in time to a hospital to receive treatment when risk factors

We address this problem by presenting a system that can automatically estimate the fetal head circumference (HC) from data obtained with use of the obstetric sweep protocol (OSP). The OSP consists of multiple pre-defined sweeps with the ultrasound transducer over the abdomen of the pregnant woman. The OSP can be taught within a day to any health care worker without prior knowledge of ultrasound. An experienced sonographer acquired both the standard plane-to obtain the reference HC-and the OSP from 183 pregnant women in St. Luke's Hospital, Wolisso, Ethiopia. The OSP data, which will most likely not contain the standard plane, was used to automatically estimate HC using two fully convolutional neural networks. First, a VGG-Net-inspired network was trained to automatically detect the frames that contained the fetal head. Second, a U-net-inspired network was trained to automatically measure the HC for all frames in which the first network detected a fetal head. The HC was estimated from these frame measurements, and the curve of Hadlock was used to determine gestational age (GA). The results indicated that most automatically estimated GAs fell within the P2.5-P97.5 interval of the Hadlock curve compared with the GAs obtained from the reference HC, so it is possible to automatically estimate GA from OSP data. Our method therefore has potential application for providing maternal care in resource-constrained countries.},

  abstract = {This review presents the current state of the art regarding multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of prostate cancer. Technical requirements and clinical indications for the use of multiparametric MR imaging in detection, localization, characterization, staging, biopsy guidance, and active surveillance of prostate cancer are discussed. Although reported accuracies of the separate and combined multiparametric MR imaging techniques vary for diverse clinical prostate cancer indications, multiparametric MR imaging of the prostate has shown promising results and may be of additional value in prostate cancer localization and local staging. Consensus on which technical approaches (field strengths, sequences, use of an endorectal coil) and combination of multiparametric MR imaging techniques should be used for specific clinical indications remains a challenge. Because guidelines are currently lacking, suggestions for a general minimal protocol for multiparametric MR imaging of the prostate based on the literature and the authors' experience are presented. Computer programs that allow evaluation of the various components of a multiparametric MR imaging examination in one view should be developed. In this way, an integrated interpretation of anatomic and functional MR imaging techniques in a multiparametric MR imaging examination is possible. Education and experience of specialist radiologists are essential for correct interpretation of multiparametric prostate MR imaging findings. Supportive techniques, such as computer-aided diagnosis are needed to obtain a fast, cost-effective, easy, and more reproducible prostate cancer diagnosis out of more and more complex multiparametric MR imaging data.

  abstract = {RATIONALE Recent evidence indicates that the rate of lung function decline is steepest in mild COPD and slower in moderate to severe COPD. The current study assessed whether lung function decline relates to baseline airflow obstruction severity in male heavy smokers. METHODS In total, 2,003 male smokers with a mean (SD) age of 59.8 (5.3) years underwent pulmonary function testing at baseline and after 3 year follow-up. Participants were classified by entry FEV(1)/FVC as follows: Group 1, >70\%; Group 2, <70\% but >LLN; and group 3, <LLN. Differences in lung function decline among the groups were assessed using multiple regression after adjustment for packyears, smoking status (current/former smoker), presence/absence of mucus production, centre, height, age, CT-derived emphysema severity (Perc15), observation time (years in study) and the baseline values. RESULTS Over three years, the mean (SD) FEV(1)/FVC , FEV(1) and MEF(50) decreases in Group 1 were 3.1\% (1), 0.21 L (0.07) and a 0.40 L/s (0.26), respectively. In Group 3, these decreases were 2.4\% (1.1), 0.15 L (0.08) and 0.06 L/s (0.19), respectively. All lung function parameters showed the greatest decline in Group 1 (p<0.001). CONCLUSION Diagnosing COPD based on the presence of more severe airflow obstruction (as defined by FEV(1)/FVC <LLN) means that, at the time of such a diagnosis, subjects passed the phase of strong lung function decline.},

  abstract = {Background: There is increasing evidence that structural lung changes may be present before the occurrence of airflow limitation as assessed by spirometry. This study investigated the prevalence of computed tomography (CT) quantified emphysema, airway wall thickening and gas trapping according to classification of airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC <70% and/or < the lower limit of normal (LLN)) in (heavy) smokers. Methods: A total number of 1,140 male former and current smokers participating in a lung cancer screenings trial (NELSON) were included and underwent chest CT scanning and spirometry. Emphysema was quantified by the 15th percentile, air way wall thickening by the square root of wall area for a theoretical airway with 10mm lumen perimeter (Pi10) and gas trapping by the mean lung density expiratory/inspiratory (E/I)-ratio. Participants were classified by entry FEV1/FVC: group 1>70%; group 2<70% but >LLN; and group 3<LLN. 32 restricted subjects, i.e. FEV1/FVC >70% but FEV1 <80% predicted, were excluded. Multivariate regression analysis correcting for covariates was used to asses the extent of emphysema, airway wall thickening and gas trapping according to three groups of airflow limitation. Results: Mean (standard deviation) age was 62.5 (5.2) years and packyears smoked was 41.0 (18.0). Group 2 subjects when compared to group 1 had a significantly lower 15th percentile, -920.6 HU versus -912.2 HU; a higher Pi10, 2.87 mm versus 2.57 mm; and a higher E/I-ratio, 88.6% versus 85.6% (all p<0.001). Conclusion: Subjects with an FEV1/FVC<70%, but above the LLN, have a significant greater degree of structural lung changes on CT compared to subjects without airflow limitation.},

The etiology of AMD is multifactorial and is influenced by environmental and genetic risk factors. In this study, we examine how 19 common risk variants contribute to drusen progression, a hallmark of AMD pathogenesis.Exome chip data was made available through the International AMD Genomics Consortium (IAMDGC). Drusen quantification was carried out with color fundus photographs using an automated drusen detection and quantification algorithm. A genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated per subject by summing risk allele counts at 19 common genetic risk variants weighted by their respective effect sizes. Pathway analysis of drusen progression was carried out with the software package Pathway Analysis by Randomization Incorporating Structure.We observed significant correlation with drusen baseline area and the GRS in the age-related eye disease study (AREDS) dataset (? = 0.175, P = 0.006). Measures of association were not statistically significant between drusen progression and the GRS (P = 0.54). Pathway analysis revealed the cell adhesion molecules pathway as the most highly significant pathway associated with drusen progression (corrected P = 0.02).In this study, we explored the potential influence of known common AMD genetic risk factors on drusen progression. Our results from the GRS analysis showed association of increasing genetic burden (from 19 AMD associated loci) to baseline drusen load but not drusen progression in the AREDS dataset while pathway analysis suggests additional genetic contributors to AMD risk.},

  year = {2011},
  abstract = {PURPOSE Tuberculosis (TB) screening programs are expensive because of, the large numbers of chest radiographs (CXR) that need to be read by human experts. The performance of a computer aided detection (CADx) system to detect TB on CXR is evaluated to determine its potential to triage images within a high throughput digital mobile TB screening program for high risk groups in London, UK. METHOD AND MATERIALS A large image database consisting of 47,510 CXR from 38,717 individuals was collected by the screening program between 2005 and 2010. In that period 120 screened patients were diagnosed with pulmonary TB. A set of 184 digital chest radiographs (DigitalDiagnost Trixel, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands) from the screening program were selected to evaluate the CAD system on its ability to discriminate between TB proven and non-TB images. For training 89 images were used (69 consecutive non-TB images and all 20 culture proven TB images from 2006). The system was tested on the remaining 95 cases (67 consecutive non-TB images from 2006 and all 28 culture proven TB images from 2009). The research prototype CADx system (Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, Delft Diagnostic Imaging, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) was originally developed for analysis of CXR from high burden countries in sub Sahara Africa. It was retrained with abnormal regions that were outlined in the proven TB training cases. Diffuse abnormalities are detected by classifying small patches as normal or suggestive of TB inside automatically segmented unobscured lung fields. The probabilistic labels of the classified patches are then combined into one abnormality score for each image. The CADx system was evaluated on these scores using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis and specificity at 95% sensitivity. RESULTS The area under the ROC curve of the CADx system was 0.86. At a sensitivity of 95%, the specificity was 60%. CONCLUSION CADx can identify a large proportion of normal images in a TB screening setting at high sensitivity and has potential to be used for triage. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Initial results demonstrate that the system could discard approximately 60% of images to potentially reduce the workload and costs of human readers while keeping a sensitivity of 95%.},

Pixel classification is applied in two stages and separately for the interior, the border and the head of the clavicle. This is used as input for active shape model segmentation. Finally dynamic programming is employed with an optimized cost function that combines appearance information of the interior of the clavicle, the border, the head and shape information derived from the active shape model. The method is compared with a number of previously described methods and with independent human observers on a large database. This database contains both normal and abnormal images and will be made publicly available. The mean contour distance of the proposed method on 249 test images is 1.1 +/- 1.6 mm and the intersection over union is 0.86 +/- 0.10.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Chest radiographs commonly contain projections of foreign objects, such as buttons, brassier clips, jewellery, or pacemakers and wires. The presence of these structures can substantially affect the output of computer analysis of these images. An automated method is presented to detect, segment, and remove foreign objects from chest radiographs. Methods: Detection is performed using supervised pixel classification with a kNN classifier, resulting in a probability estimate per pixel to belong to a projected foreign object. Segmentation is performed by grouping and post-processing pixels with a probability above a certain threshold. Next, the objects are replaced by texture inpainting. Results: The method is evaluated in experiments on 257 chest radiographs. The detection at pixel level is evaluated with receiver operating characteristic analysis on pixels within the unobscured lung fields and an Az value of 0.949 is achieved. Free response operator characteristic analysis is performed at the object level, and 95.6% of objects are detected with on average 0.25 false positive detections per image. To investigate the effect of removing the detected objects through inpainting, a texture analysis system for tuberculosis detection is applied to images with and without pathology and with and without foreign object removal. Unprocessed, the texture analysis abnormality score of normal images with foreign objects is comparable to those with pathology. After removing foreign objects, the texture score of normal images with and without foreign objects is similar, while abnormal images, whether they contain foreign objects or not, achieve on average higher scores. Conclusions: The authors conclude that removal of foreign objects from chest radiographs is feasible and beneficial for automated image analysis.},

  abstract = {Projection images, such as those routinely acquired in radiological practice, are difficult to analyze because multiple 3D structures superimpose at a single point in the 2D image. Removal of particular superimposed structures may improve interpretation of these images, both by humans and by computers. This work therefore presents a general method to isolate and suppress structures in 2D projection images. The focus is on elongated structures, which allows an intensity model of a structure of interest to be extracted using local information only. The model is created from profiles sampled perpendicular to the structure. Profiles containing other structures are detected and removed to reduce the influence on the model. Subspace filtering, using blind source separation techniques, is applied to separate the structure to be suppressed from other structures. By subtracting the modeled structure from the original image a structure suppressed image is created. The method is evaluated in four experiments. In the first experiment ribs are suppressed in 20 artificial radiographs simulated from 3D lung computed tomography (CT) images. The proposed method with blind source separation and outlier detection shows superior suppression of ribs in simulated radiographs, compared to a simplified approach without these techniques. Additionally, the ability of three observers to discriminate between patches containing ribs and containing no ribs, as measured by the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC), reduced from 0.99-1.00 on original images to 0.75-0.84 on suppressed images. In the second experiment clavicles are suppressed in 253 chest radiographs. The effect of suppression on clavicle visibility is evaluated using the clavicle contrast and border response, showing a reduction of 78\% and 34\% respectively. In the third experiment nodules extracted from CT were simulated close to the clavicles in 100 chest radiographs. It was found that after suppression contrast of the nodules was higher than of the clavicles and 2.46 respectively). In the fourth experiment catheters were suppressed in chest radiographs. The ability of three observers to discriminate between patches originating from 36 images with and 21 images without catheters, as measured by the AUC, reduced from 0.98-0.99 on original images to 0.64-0.74 on suppressed images. We conclude that the presented method can markedly reduce the visibility of elongated structures in chest radiographs and shows potential to enhance diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a common disease with high mortality and morbidity rates worldwide. The chest radiograph (CXR) is frequently used in diagnostic algorithms for pulmonary TB. Automatic systems to detect TB on CXRs can improve the efficiency of such diagnostic algorithms. The diverse manifestation of TB on CXRs from different populations requires a system that can be adapted to deal with different types of abnormalities. A computer aided detection (CAD) system was developed which combines the results of supervised subsystems detecting textural, shape, and focal abnormalities into one TB score. The textural abnormality subsystem provided several subscores analyzing different types of textural abnormalities and different regions in the lung. The shape and focal abnormality subsystem each provided one subscore. A general framework was developed to combine an arbitrary number of subscores: subscores were normalized, collected in a feature vector and then combined using a supervised classifier into one combined TB score. Two databases, both consisting of 200 digital CXRs, were used for evaluation, acquired from (A) a Western high-risk group screening and (B) TB suspect screening in Africa. The subscores and combined TB score were compared to two references: an external, non-radiological, reference and a radiological reference determined by a human expert. The area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve Az was used to measure performance. Additionally, the performance of an independent human observer was compared to the best individual subscore and to the combined TB score. For database A, the best performing subscores achieved Az = 0.827 and 0.821 for the external and radiological reference respectively, whereas in database B Az = 0.759 and 0.866 was achieved. Different subscores performed best in the two databases. The combined TB score performed better than the individual subscores, except for the external reference in database B, giving performances of 0.868 and 0.847 in database A and 0.741 and 0.899 in database B. The performances of the independent observer, 0.910 and 0.942 in database A and 0.755 and 0.939 in database B were slightly higher than the combined TB score. Compared to the external reference, differences in performance between the combined TB score and the independent observer were not significant in both databases. The combined TB score performed better than the individual subscores and approaches performance of human observers with respect to the external and radiological reference. Supervised combination to compute an overall TB score allows for a necessary adaptation of the CAD system to different settings or different operational requirements. I.},

  abstract = {Symmetry is an important feature of human anatomy and the absence of symmetry in medical images can indicate the presence of pathology. Quantification of image symmetry can then be used to improve the automatic analysis of medical images. A method is presented that computes both local and global symmetry in 2D medical images. A symmetry axis is determined to define for each position p in the image a mirrored position p' on the contralateral side of the axis. In the neighborhood of p', an optimally corresponding position ps is determined by minimizing a cost function d that combines intensity differences in a patch around p and the mirrored patch around ps and the spatial distance between p' and ps . The optimal value of d is used as a measure of local symmetry s. The average of all values of s, indicated as S, quantifies global symmetry. Starting from an initial approximation of the symmetry axis, the optimal orientation and position of the axis is determined by greedy minimization of S. The method was evaluated in three experiments concerning abnormality detection in frontal chest radiographs. In the first experiment, global symmetry S was used to discriminate between 174 normal images and 174 images containing diffuse textural abnormalities from the publicly available CRASS database of tuberculosis suspects. Performance, measured as Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve Az was 0.838. The second experiment investigated whether adding the local symmetry s as an additional feature to a set of 106 texture features resulted in improvements in classifying local patches in the same image database. We found that Az increased from 0.878 to 0.891 (p = 0.001). In the third experiment it was shown that the contrast of pulmonary nodules, obtained from the publicly available JSRT database, increased significantly in the local symmetry map compared to the original image. We conclude that the proposed algorithm for symmetry computation provides informative features which can be used to improve abnormality detection in medical images both at a local and a global level.

  title = {Improved volumetric breast density assessment in dense breasts},
  booktitle = {7th International Workshop on Breast Densitometry and Cancer Risk Assessment},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {To personalize screening procedures, volumetric percent density (VPD) may be used to stratify risk groups. To obtain VPD, the glandular tissue volume (GTV) is estimated in unprocessed mammograms using a physics-based method which relies on an internal reference value (RV) representing the projection of fat only. However, pure fat pixels are rare in dense breasts, causing an underestimation of GTV and VPD. The purpose of this work is to improve the VPD estimate in dense breasts. We collected 43 paired FFDM and MRI examinations. Mammographic VPD was estimated in different ways using three different reference values and compared to estimations based on MRI data. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated with estimations averaged over both breasts and both mammographic views. The first two RVs are percentiles (0.99) of the pixel value distribution in the breast interior (BI). RV1 was obtained with a small BI. For RV2, a larger BI was used. Especially in dense breasts this may facilitate the identification of a pure fat pixel, that may not be present in the small BI. RV3 was defined by estimating the proportion of dense tissue in the densest location in the larger BI, using the maximum fraction of dense tissue projected on a line crossing the BI. Additionally we investigated a combination of the three estimations, by taking estimations of RV1 for nondense breasts and a combination of the results of RV2 and RV3 for dense breasts, using the estimation with RV1 to determine if the breast is dense. We found correlations of 0.89, 0.87 and 0.76 using RV1, RV2 and RV3 respectively. This improved to 0.91 when combining the three estimations. The reference value determination is crucial for calculation of VPD. The combination of three different methods yields the best result as different breasts density patterns require different approaches.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE The sensitivity of mammograms is low for women with dense breasts, since cancers may be masked by dense tissue. In this study, we investigate methods to identify women with density patterns associated with a high masking risk. Three methods based on quantitative volumetric breast density analysis are compared to an area based density measure. METHOD AND MATERIALS We used the last negative screening mammograms of 87 women who subsequently presented an interval cancer (IC) and, as controls, 870 randomly selected normal screening exams from women without cancer. Volumetric breast density maps (VBDMs) were computed using software provided by Matakina (Wellington, New Zealand). These maps provide dense tissue thickness for each pixel location. We used the VBDMs to compute three masking measures: 1) Volume of glandular tissue (VGT), 2) Percent dense volume (PDV), and 3) Percent area where dense tissue thickness exceeds 1cm (PA1). In addition, we determined percentage dense area (PDA) after classifying pixels automatically in dense and nondense classes (random forest classifier). Methods were applied to MLO views and averaged per exam. For each method, we selected cases with the highest masking measure (by thresholding) and computed the fraction of ICs as a function of the fraction of controls selected. We used the Volpara Density Grade (VDG, threshold on PDV) to distinguish women with nondense breasts from dense breasts (VDG3+4). In practice women with dense breasts are offered supplemental screening. We determined the fraction of controls corresponding to this categorization, and determined sensitivity of our masking measures to select women with masked cancers. RESULTS Using VDG, 38% of the controls have dense breasts. When offering 38% of the women supplemental screening, 55%, 66%, 71% and 60% of the women with IC would be included using VGT, PDV, PA1 and PDA respectively. The sensitivity of PA1 was significantly higher compared to VGT and PDA (p-value <0.05). CONCLUSION Measures based on volumetric density maps are a promising tool to identify women with a high risk for a masked cancer. Novel masking risk measures have a higher sensitivity than often used measures such as percent dense volume and area. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION When offering supplemental screening to women with a high risk for masked cancer, the response of this group should be as high as possible to make supplemental screening feasible and cost efficient.},

RESULTS The highest ratio between IC and supplemental screening rate has been observed for PA1 at a screening rate of 5% and a sensitivity of almost 20%. For screening rates above 20%, the highest response of IC can be observed when using PA1 and PT for stratification. CONCLUSION We showed that the different breast density measures are suited for stratification. A careful choice of the stratification criteria is necessary depending on the number of women that one is willing to offer supplemental screening.

  title = {Consistency of density categories over multiple screening rounds using volumetric breast density},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {PURPOSE As a result of the breast density laws, clinicians in many states are obliged to inform women about their breast density and the increased risk that is associated with dense breasts. An increasing number of women with dense breasts decides to have supplemental screening. Using an automated software system, we investigated the consistency of the classification of serial screening mammograms in non-dense and dense classes over time. METHOD AND MATERIALS Full field digital mammograms from a breast cancer screening program were used in which women are invited every two years, starting at the age of 50. The initial screening exam and three subsequent screening exams were available for 2504 women. The average screening interval was 24.4 months. All images were processed by Volpara 1.5.0 (Matakina, Wellington, New Zealand); volumetric percent breast density (PDV) was calculated and averaged over both MLO images. Using the thresholds of the Volpara Density Grade (VDG), all exams were classified as non-dense (PDV<7.5, VDG1+2) or dense (PDV>7.5, VDG3+4). Additionally, to avoid class switches due to small fluctuations of PDV, we defined a gated threshold as follows: For a change to the dense category a PDV greater than 8.3 was required, for a decrease a threshold of 6.7 was used. The gate width was based on noise measures. RESULTS The majority of women stayed in the same category for the whole period, 38.9% non-dense and 34.5% dense, using the fixed threshold. In 18.1% of the women density decreased and the class changed from dense to non-dense; The deviating patterns were as follows: For 2.4% of the women one intermediate exam was classified as non-dense, while all other exams were dense. Three non-dense and one dense exam were observed in 3.8%. In 2.4% two exams were classified as dense and two as non-dense. Use of the gated threshold reduced the number of women with a deviating pattern. CONCLUSION Classification into dense and non-dense classes gives stable results over time. Only in a small fraction of the population do we need to assume that an exam was not assigned to the proper class. Use of a gated threshold to separate the non-dense from the dense class reduces the percentage of misclassified exams. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION A consistent classification in non-dense and dense classes is important, as women and clinicians might lose confidence in the stratification process when supplemental screening is offered in deviating pattern.},

In this study, we investigated methods to identify women with density patterns associated with a high masking risk. Risk measures are derived from volumetric breast density maps.
                             We used the last negative screening mammograms of 93 women who subsequently presented with an interval cancer (IC), and, as controls, 930 randomly selected normal screening exams from women without cancer. Volumetric breast density maps were computed from the mammograms, which provide the dense tissue thickness at each location. These were used to compute absolute and percentage glandular tissue volume.
                             We modeled the masking risk for each pixel location using the absolute and percentage dense tissue thickness and we investigated the effect of taking the cancer location probability distribution (CLPD) into account.
                             For each method, we selected cases with the highest masking measure (by thresholding) and computed the fraction of ICs as a function of the fraction of controls selected. The latter can be interpreted as the negative supplemental screening rate (NSSR).
                             Between the models, when incorporating CLPD, no significant differences were found. In general, the methods performed better when CLPD was included. At higher NSSRs some of the investigated masking measures had a significantly higher performance than volumetric breast density. These measures may therefore serve as an alternative to identify women with a high risk for a masked cancer.},

  abstract = {During mammographic acquisition, the breast is compressed between the breast support plate and the compression paddle to improve image quality and reduce dose, among other reasons. The applied force, which is measured by the imaging device, varies substantially, due to local guidelines, positioning, and breast size. Force measurements may not be very relevant though, because the amount of compression will be related to pressure rather than force. With modern image analysis techniques, the contact surface of the breast under compression can be determined and pressure can be computed retrospectively. In this study, we investigate if there is a relation between pressure applied to the breast during compression and screening performance.
                             In a series of 113,464 screening exams from the Dutch breast cancer screening program we computed the compression pressure applied in the MLO projections of the right and left breasts. The exams were binned into five groups of increasing applied pressure, in such a way that each group contains 20% of the exams. Thresholds were 7.68, 9.18, 10.71 and 12.81 kPa. Screening performance measures were determined for each group. Differences across the groups were investigated with a Pearson's Chi Square test. It was found that PPV and the cancer detection rate vary significantly within the five groups (p = 0.001 and p = 0.011 respectively).The PPV was 25.4, 31.2, 32.7, 25.8 and 22.0 for the five groups with increasing pressure. The recall rate, false positive rate and specificity were not statistically significant from the expectation (p-values: 0.858, 0.088 and 0.094 respectively). Even though differences are not significant, there is a trend that the groups with a moderate pressure have a better performance compared to the first and last category.
                             The results suggest that high pressure reduces detectability of breast cancer. The best screening results were found in the groups with a moderate pressure.},

We investigated the categorization of pairs of subsequent screening mammograms into density classes by human readers and by an automated system. With software (VDG) and by four readers, including three specialized breast radiologists, 1000 mammograms belonging to 500 pairs of subsequent screening exams were categorized into either two or four density classes. We calculated percent agreement and the percentage of women that changed from dense to non-dense and vice versa. Inter-exam agreement (IEA) was calculated with kappa statistics. Results were computed for each reader individually and for the case that each mammogram was classified by one of the four readers by random assignment (group reading). Higher percent agreement was found with VDG (90.4\%, CI 87.9-92.9\%) than with readers (86.2-89.2\%), while less plausible changes from non-dense to dense occur less often with VDG (2.8\%, CI 1.4-4.2\%) than with group reading (4.2\%, CI 2.4-6.0\%). We found an IEA of 0.68-0.77 for the readers using two classes and an IEA of 0.76-0.82 using four classes. IEA is significantly higher with VDG compared to group reading. The categorization of serial mammograms in density classes is more consistent with automated software than with a mixed group of human readers. When using breast density to personalize screening protocols, assessment with software may be preferred over assessment by radiologists.},

                             Methods: The last negative screening mammograms of 111 women with interval cancer (IC) within 12 months after the examination and 1110 selected normal screening exams from women without cancer were used. From the mammograms volumetric breast density maps were computed, which provide the dense tissue thickness for each pixel location. With these maps, three measurements were derived: 1) Percent dense volume (PDV), 2) Percent area where dense tissue thickness exceeds 1cm (PDA), 3) Dense Tissue Masking Model (DTMM). Breast density was scored by a breast radiologist using BI-RADS. Women with heterogeneously and extremely dense breasts were considered at high masking risk. For each masking measure, mammograms were divided into a high and low risk category, such that the same proportion of the controls is at high masking risk as with BI-RADS.
                             Results: Of the women with IC, 66.1%, 71.9%, 69.2% and 63.0% were categorized to be at high masking risk with PDV, PDA, DTMM and BI-RADS respectively, against 38.5% of the controls. The proportion of IC at high masking risk is statistically significantly different between BI-RADS and PDA (p-value 0.022). Differences between BI-RADS and PDV, or BI-RADS and DTMM, are not statistically significant.
                             Conclusion: Measures based on density maps, and in particular PDA, are promising tools to identify women at high risk for a masked cancer.},

However, pixels representing fat only may not be present in dense breasts, causing an underestimation of density measurements. In this work, we investigate alternative approaches for obtaining a tissue reference value to improve density estimations, particularly in dense breasts.
                             Two of three investigated reference values (F1, F2) are percentiles of the pixel value distribution in the breast interior (the contact area of breast and compression paddle). F1 is determined in a small breast interior, which minimizes the risk that peripheral pixels are included in the measurement at the cost of increasing the chance that no proper reference can be found. F2 is obtained using a larger breast interior. The new approach which is developed for very dense breasts does not require the presence of a fatty tissue region. As reference region we select the densest region in the mammogram and assume that this represents a projection of entirely dense tissue embedded between the subcutaneous fatty tissue layers. By measuring the thickness of the fat layers a reference (F3) can be computed. To obtain accurate breast density estimates irrespective of breast composition we investigated a combination of the results of the three reference values. We collected 202 pairs of MRI's and digital mammograms from 119 women. We compared the percent dense volume estimates based on both modalities and calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients.
                             With the references F1-F3 we found respectively a correlation of R=0.80, R=0.89 and R=0.74. Best results were obtained with the combination of the density estimations (R=0.90).
                             Results show that better volumetric density estimates can be obtained with the hybrid method, in particular for dense breasts, when algorithms are combined to obtain a fatty tissue reference value depending on breast composition.},

  abstract = {It is not new that women with high breast density (the amount of ducts and epithelial tissue in relation to the breast volume) have an increased breast cancer risk compared to women with low breast density. When measuring the influence of breast density on the performance of the Dutch breast cancer screening program, we see that the sensitivity decreases with increasing density. Women with dense breast have not only an increased breast cancer risk but also an increased risk that the tumour is not detected within the screening program. Hence, breast density could be used for personalised screening. Depending on the breast cancer risk and the risk of not detecting the tumour with mammography, additional imaging with ultrasound or MRI could be offered. Next to the influence of breast density on the screening program performance, we investigated the consistency of breast density estimations between a computer program and radiologists, and whether these density measurements are suitable for a stratification into different screening regimes.},

  abstract = {Background In mammography, breast compression is applied to reduce the thickness of the breast. While it is widely accepted that firm breast compression is needed to ensure acceptable image quality, guidelines remain vague about how much compression should be applied during mammogram acquisition. A quantitative parameter indicating the desirable amount of compression is not available. Consequently, little is known about the relationship between the amount of breast compression and breast cancer detectability. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of breast compression pressure in mammography on breast cancer screening outcomes.
                             Methods We used digital image analysis methods to determine breast volume, percent dense volume, and pressure from 132,776 examinations of 57,179 women participating in the Dutch population-based biennial breast cancer screening program. Pressure was estimated by dividing the compression force by the area of the contact surface between breast and compression paddle. The data was subdivided into quintiles of pressure and the number of screen-detected cancers, interval cancers, false positives, and true negatives were determined for each group. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for correlation between examinations of the same woman and for the effect of breast density and volume when estimating sensitivity, specificity, and other performance measures. Sensitivity was computed using interval cancers occurring between two screening rounds and using interval cancers within 12 months after screening. Pair-wise testing for significant differences was performed.
                             Results Percent dense volume increased with increasing pressure, while breast volume decreased. Sensitivity in quintiles with increasing pressure was 82.0%, 77.1%, 79.8%, 71.1%, and 70.8%. Sensitivity based on interval cancers within 12 months was significantly lower in the highest pressure quintile compared to the third (84.3% vs 93.9%, p=0.034). Specificity was lower in the lowest pressure quintile (98.0%) compared to the second, third, and fourth group (98.5%, p<0.005). Specificity of the fifth quintile was 98.4%.
                             Conclusion Results suggest that if too much pressure is applied during mammography this may reduce sensitivity. In contrast, if pressure is low this may decrease specificity.},

  abstract = {To investigate the relation between baseline cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and the risk of incident parkinsonism using different MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures.In the Radboud University Nijmegen Diffusion Tensor and Magnetic Resonance Cohort (RUN DMC) study, a prospective cohort study, 503 elderly participants with SVD and without parkinsonism were included in 2006. During follow-up (2011-2012), parkinsonism was diagnosed according to UK Brain Bank criteria. Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the association between baseline imaging measures and incident all-cause parkinsonism and vascular parkinsonism (VP). Tract-based spatial statistics analysis was used to identify differences in baseline DTI measures of white matter (WM) tracts between participants with VP and without parkinsonism.Follow-up was available from 501 participants (mean age 65.6 years; mean follow-up duration 5.2 years). Parkinsonism developed in 20 participants; 15 were diagnosed with VP. The 5-year risk of (any) parkinsonism was increased for those with a high white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume (hazard ratio [HR] 1.8 per SD increase, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-2.4) and a high number of lacunes (HR 1.4 per number increase, 95\% CI 1.1-1.8) at baseline. For VP, this risk was also increased by the presence of microbleeds (HR 5.7, 95\% CI 1.9-16.8) and a low gray matter volume (HR 0.4 per SD increase, 95\% CI 0.2-0.8). Lower fractional anisotropy values in bifrontal WM tracts involved in movement control were observed in participants with VP compared to participants without parkinsonism.SVD at baseline, especially a high WMH volume and a high number of lacunes, is associated with incident parkinsonism. Our findings favor a role of SVD in the etiology of parkinsonism.},

  abstract = {The relation between progression of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and gait decline is uncertain, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies on gait decline are lacking. We therefore investigated the longitudinal associations between (micro) structural brain changes and gait decline in SVD using DTI. 275 participants were included from the Radboud University Nijmegen Diffusion tensor and Magnetic resonance imaging Cohort (RUN DMC), a prospective cohort of participants with cerebral small vessel disease aged 50-85 years. Gait (using GAITRite) and magnetic resonance imaging measures were assessed during baseline (2006-2007) and follow-up (2011 - 2012). Linear regression analysis was used to investigate the association between changes in conventional magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor imaging measures and gait decline. Tract-based spatial statistics analysis was used to investigate region-specific associations between changes in white matter integrity and gait decline. 56.2% were male, mean age was 62.9 years (SD8.2), mean follow-up duration was 5.4 years (SD0.2) and mean gait speed decline was 0.2 m/s (SD0.2). Stride length decline was associated with white matter atrophy (b = 0.16, p = 0.007), and increase in mean white matter radial diffusivity and mean diffusivity, and decrease in mean fractional anisotropy (respectively, b = - 0.14, p = 0.009; b = - 0.12, p = 0.018; b = 0.10, p = 0.049), independent of age, sex, height, follow-up duration and baseline stride length. Tract-based spatial statistics analysis showed significant associations between stride length decline and fractional anisotropy decrease and mean diffusivity increase (primarily explained by radial diffusivity increase) in multiple white matter tracts, with the strongest associations found in the corpus callosum and corona radiata, independent of traditional small vessel disease markers. White matter atrophy and loss of white matter integrity are associated with gait decline in older adults with small vessel disease after 5 years of follow-up. These findings suggest that progression of SVD might play an important role in gait decline.},

Materials and Methods: In this ethics committee-approved study, 46 individuals with 49 computed tomographically (CT)-detected and histologically proved lung cancers and 65 patients without nodules at CT were retrospectively included. All subjects participated in a lung cancer screening trial. Chest radiographs were obtained within 2 months after screening CT. Four radiology residents and two experienced radiologists were asked to identify and localize potential cancers on the chest radiographs, first without and subsequently with the use of CAD software. A figure of merit was calculated by using free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: Tumor diameter ranged from 5.1 to 50.7 mm (median, 11.8 mm). Fifty-one percent (22 of 49) of lesions were subtle and detected by two or fewer readers. Stand-alone CAD sensitivity was 61\%, with an average of 2.4 false-positive annotations per chest radiograph. Average sensitivity was 63\% for radiologists at 0.23 false-positive annotations per chest radiograph and 49\% for residents at 0.45 false-positive annotations per chest radiograph. Figure of merit did not change significantly for any of the observers after using CAD. CAD marked between five and 16 cancers that were initially missed by the readers. These correctly CAD-depicted lesions were rejected by radiologists in 92\% of cases and by residents in 77\% of cases. Conclusion: The sensitivity of CAD in identifying lung cancers depicted with CT screening was similar to that of experienced radiologists. However, CAD did not improve cancer detection because, especially for subtle lesions, observers were unable to sufficiently differentiate true-positive from false-positive annotations.},

  abstract = {Purpose:To assess the prevalence, natural course, and malignancy rate of perifissural nodules (PFNs) in smokers participating in a lung cancer screening trial.Materials and Methods:As part of the ethics-committee approved Dutch-Belgian Randomised Lung Cancer Multi-Slice Screening Trial (NELSON), computed tomography (CT) was used to screen 2994 current or former heavy smokers, aged 50-74 years, for lung cancer. CT was repeated after 1 and 3 years, with additional follow-up CT scans if necessary. All baseline CT scans were screened for nodules. Nodule volume was determined with automated volumetric analysis. Homogeneous solid nodules, attached to a fissure with a lentiform or triangular shape, were classified as PFNs. Nodules were considered benign if they did not grow during the total follow-up period or were proved to be benign in a follow-up by a pulmonologist. Prevalence, growth, and malignancy rate of PFNs were assessed.Results:At baseline screening, 4026 nodules were detected in 1729 participants, and 19.7\% (794 of 4026) of the nodules were classified as PFNs. The mean size of the PFNs was 4.4 mm (range: 2.8-10.6 mm) and the mean volume was 43 mm(3) (range: 13-405 mm(3)). None of the PFNs were found to be malignant during follow-up. Between baseline and the first follow-up CT scan, 15.5\% (123 of 794) were found to have grown, and 8.3\% (66 of 794) had a volume doubling time of less than 400 days. One PFN was resected and proved to be a lymph node.Conclusion:PFNs are frequently found at CT scans for lung cancer. They can show growth rates in the range of malignant nodules, but none of the PFNs in the present study turned out to be malignant. Recognition of PFNs can reduce the number of follow-up examinations required for the workup of suspicious nodules.A-A?A 1/2  RSNA, 2012.},

  abstract = {Several medical associations recommended lung cancer screening by low-dose computed tomography scanning for high-risk groups. Counselling of the candidates on the potential harms and benefits and their lung cancer risk is a prerequisite for screening. In the NELSON trial, screenings are considered positive for (part) solid lung nodules with a volume >500 mm(3) and for (part) solid or nonsolid nodules with a volume-doubling time <400 days. For this study, the performance of the NELSON strategy in three screening rounds was evaluated and risk calculations were made for a follow-up period of 5.5 years. 458 (6\%) of the 7582 participants screened had a positive screen result and 200 (2.6\%) were diagnosed with lung cancer. The positive screenings had a predictive value of 40.6\% and only 1.2\% of all scan results were false-positive. In a period of 5.5 years, the risk of screen-detected lung cancer strongly depends on the result of the first scan: 1.0\% after a negative baseline result, 5.7\% after an indeterminate baseline and 48.3\% after a positive baseline. The screening strategy yielded few positive and false-positive scans with a reasonable positive predictive value. The 5.5-year lung cancer risk calculations aid clinicians in counselling candidates for lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography.},

A volumetry-based screening strategy, stringent criteria for a positive screening, and an increasing length of screening interval are particular features of the NELSON trial.To determine the effect of stringent referral criteria and increasing screening interval on the characteristics of screen-detected lung cancers, and to compare this across screening rounds, between sexes, and with other screening trials.All NELSON participants with screen-detected lung cancer in the first three rounds were included. Lung cancer stage at diagnosis, histological subtype, and tumor localization were compared between the screening rounds, the sexes, and with other screening trials.In the first three screening rounds, 200 participants were diagnosed with 209 lung cancers. Of these lung cancers, 70.8\% were diagnosed at stage I and 8.1\% at stage IIIB-IV, and 51.2\% were adenocarcinomas. There was no significant difference in cancer stage, histology, or tumor localization across the screening rounds. Women were diagnosed at a significantly more favorable cancer stage than men. Compared with other trials, the screen-detected lung cancers of the NELSON trial were relatively more often diagnosed at stage I and less often at stage IIIB-IV.Despite stringent criteria for a positive screening, an increasing length of screening interval, and few female participants, the screening strategy of the NELSON trial resulted in a favorable cancer stage distribution at diagnosis, which is essential for the effectiveness of our screening strategy.

  abstract = {The main challenge in CT screening for lung cancer is the high prevalence of pulmonary nodules and the relatively low incidence of lung cancer. Management protocols use thresholds for nodule size and growth rate to determine which nodules require additional diagnostic procedures, but these should be based on individuals' probabilities of developing lung cancer. In this prespecified analysis, using data from the NELSON CT screening trial, we aimed to quantify how nodule diameter, volume, and volume doubling time affect the probability of developing lung cancer within 2 years of a CT scan, and to propose and evaluate thresholds for management protocols.Eligible participants in the NELSON trial were those aged 50-75 years, who have smoked 15 cigarettes or more per day for more than 25 years, or ten cigarettes or more for more than 30 years and were still smoking, or had stopped smoking less than 10 years ago. Participants were randomly assigned to low-dose CT screening at increasing intervals, or no screening. We included all participants assigned to the screening group who had attended at least one round of screening, and whose results were available from the national cancer registry database. We calculated lung cancer probabilities, stratified by nodule diameter, volume, and volume doubling time and did logistic regression analysis using diameter, volume, volume doubling time, and multinodularity as potential predictor variables. We assessed management strategies based on nodule threshold characteristics for specificity and sensitivity, and compared them to the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines. The NELSON trial is registered at www.trialregister.nl, number ISRCTN63545820.Volume, volume doubling time, and volumetry-based diameter of 9681 non-calcified nodules detected by CT screening in 7155 participants in the screening group of NELSON were used to quantify lung cancer probability. Lung cancer probability was low in participants with a nodule volume of 100 mm(3) or smaller (0*6\% [95\% CI 0*4-0*8]) or maximum transverse diameter smaller than 5 mm (0*4\% [0*2-0*7]), and not significantly different from participants without nodules (0*4\% [0*3-0*6], p=0*17 and p=1*00, respectively). Lung cancer probability was intermediate (requiring follow-up CT) if nodules had a volume of 100-300 mm(3) (2*4\% [95\% CI 1*7-3*5]) or a diameter 5-10 mm (1*3\% [1*0-1*8]). Volume doubling time further stratified the probabilities: 0*8\% (95\% CI 0*4-1*7) for volume doubling times 600 days or more, 4*0\% (1*8-8*3) for volume doubling times 400-600 days, and 9*9\% (6*9-14*1) for volume doubling times of 400 days or fewer. Lung cancer probability was high for participants with nodule volumes 300 mm(3) or bigger (16*9\% [95\% CI 14*1-20*0]) or diameters 10 mm or bigger (15*2\% [12*7-18*1]). The simulated ACCP management protocol yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 90*9\% (95\% CI 81*2-96*1), and 87*2\% (86*4-87*9), respectively. A diameter-based protocol with volumetry-based nodule diameter yielded a higher sensitivity (92*4\% [95\% CI 83*1-97*1]), and a higher specificity (90*0\% [89*3-90*7). A volume-based protocol (with thresholds based on lung cancer probability) yielded the same sensitivity as the ACCP protocol (90*9\% [95\% CI 81*2-96*1]), and a higher specificity (94*9\% [94*4-95*4]).Small nodules (those with a volume <100 mm(3) or diameter <5 mm) are not predictive for lung cancer. Immediate diagnostic evaluation is necessary for large nodules (>=300 mm(3) or >=10 mm). Volume doubling time assessment is advocated only for intermediate-sized nodules (with a volume ranging between 100-300 mm(3) or diameter of 5-10 mm). Nodule management protocols based on these thresholds performed better than the simulated ACCP nodule protocol.Zorgonderzoek Nederland Medische Wetenschappen and Koningin Wilhelmina Fonds.},

  abstract = {Low-dose CT screening is recommended for individuals at high risk of developing lung cancer. However, CT screening does not detect all lung cancers: some might be missed at screening, and others can develop in the interval between screens. The NELSON trial is a randomised trial to assess the effect of screening with increasing screening intervals on lung cancer mortality. In this prespecified analysis, we aimed to assess screening test performance, and the epidemiological, radiological, and clinical characteristics of interval cancers in NELSON trial participants assigned to the screening group.Eligible participants in the NELSON trial were those aged 50-75 years, who had smoked 15 or more cigarettes per day for more than 25 years or ten or more cigarettes for more than 30 years, and were still smoking or had quit less than 10 years ago. We included all participants assigned to the screening group who had attended at least one round of screening. Screening test results were based on volumetry using a two-step approach. Initially, screening test results were classified as negative, indeterminate, or positive based on nodule presence and volume. Subsequently, participants with an initial indeterminate result underwent follow-up screening to classify their final screening test result as negative or positive, based on nodule volume doubling time. We obtained information about all lung cancer diagnoses made during the first three rounds of screening, plus an additional 2 years of follow-up from the national cancer registry. We determined epidemiological, radiological, participant, and tumour characteristics by reassessing medical files, screening CTs, and clinical CTs. The NELSON trial is registered at www.trialregister.nl, number ISRCTN63545820.15AC/a,!E+822 participants were enrolled in the NELSON trial, of whom 7915 were assigned to low-dose CT screening with increasing interval between screens, and 7907 to no screening. We included 7155 participants in our study, with median follow-up of 8A,A*16 years (IQR 7A,A*56-8A,A*56). 187 (3\%) of 7155 screened participants were diagnosed with 196 screen-detected lung cancers, and another 34 (<1\%; 19 [56\%] in the first year after screening, and 15 [44\%] in the second year after screening) were diagnosed with 35 interval cancers. For the three screening rounds combined, with a 2-year follow-up, sensitivity was 84A,A*6\% (95\% CI 79A,A*6-89A,A*2), specificity was 98A,A*6\% (95\% CI 98A,A*5-98A,A*8), positive predictive value was 40A,A*4\% (95\% CI 35A,A*9-44A,A*7), and negative predictive value was 99A,A*8\% (95\% CI 99A,A*8-99A,A*9). Retrospective assessment of the last screening CT and clinical CT in 34 patients with interval cancer showed that interval cancers were not visible in 12 (35\%) cases. In the remaining cases, cancers were visible when retrospectively assessed, but were not diagnosed because of radiological detection and interpretation errors (17 [50\%]), misclassification by the protocol (two [6\%]), participant non-compliance (two [6\%]), and non-adherence to protocol (one [3\%]). Compared with screen-detected cancers, interval cancers were diagnosed at more advanced stages (29 [83\%] of 35 interval cancers vs 44 [22\%] of 196 screen-detected cancers diagnosed in stage III or IV; p<0A,A*0001), were more often small-cell carcinomas (seven [20\%] vs eight [4\%]; p=0A,A*003) and less often adenocarcinomas (nine [26\%] vs 102 [52\%]; p=0A,A*005).Lung cancer screening in the NELSON trial yielded high specificity and sensitivity, with only a small number of interval cancers. The results of this study could be used to improve screening algorithms, and reduce the number of missed cancers.Zorgonderzoek Nederland Medische Wetenschappen and Koningin Wilhelmina Fonds.},

  abstract = {We propose and evaluate a novel method for automatically detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI). Prostate zones play an important role in the assessment of prostate cancer on MRI. We hypothesize that the inclusion of zonal information can improve the performance of a deep learning based csPCa lesion detection model. However, segmentation of prostate zones is challenging and therefore deterministic models are inaccurate. Hence, we investigated probabilistic zonal segmentation. Our baseline detection model is a 2DUNet trained to produce a csPCa heatmap followed by a 3D detector. We experimented with the integration of zonal prior information by fusing the output of an anisotropic 3DUNet trained to produce either a deterministic or probabilistic map for each prostate zone. We also investigate the effect of early or late fusion on csPCa detection. All methods were trained and tested on 848 bpMRI. The results show that fusing zonal prior knowledge improves the baseline detection model with a preference for probabilistic over deterministic zonal segmentation.},

   To assess Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS)-trained deep learning (DL) algorithm performance and to investigate the effect of data size and prior knowledge on the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in biopsy-naive men with a suspicion of PCa.

   Methods
   Multi-institution data included 2734 consecutive biopsy-naive men with elevated PSA levels (>= 3 ng/mL) that underwent multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI). mpMRI exams were prospectively reported using PI-RADS v2 by expert radiologists. A DL framework was designed and trained on center 1 data (n = 1952) to predict PI-RADS >= 4 (n = 1092) lesions from bi-parametric MRI (bpMRI). Experiments included varying the number of cases and the use of automatic zonal segmentation as a DL prior. Independent center 2 cases (n = 296) that included pathology outcome (systematic and MRI targeted biopsy) were used to compute performance for radiologists and DL. The performance of detecting PI-RADS 4-5 and Gleason > 6 lesions was assessed on 782 unseen cases (486 center 1, 296 center 2) using free-response ROC (FROC) and ROC analysis.

   Results
   The DL sensitivity for detecting PI-RADS >= 4 lesions was 87% (193/223, 95% CI: 82-91) at an average of 1 false positive (FP) per patient, and an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84-0.91). The DL sensitivity for the detection of Gleason > 6 lesions was 85% (79/93, 95% CI: 77-83) @ 1 FP compared to 91% (85/93, 95% CI: 84-96) @ 0.3 FP for a consensus panel of expert radiologists. Data size and prior zonal knowledge significantly affected performance (4%, p<0.05).

   Conclusion
   PI-RADS-trained DL can accurately detect and localize Gleason > 6 lesions. DL could reach expert performance using substantially more than 2000 training cases, and DL zonal segmentation.},

  title = {Automatic muscle and fat segmentation in 3D abdominal CT images for body composition assessment},
  abstract = {Body composition is an informative biomarker in the treatment of cancer. In particular, low muscle mass has been associated with higher chemotherapy toxicity, shorter time to tumor progression, poorer surgical outcomes, impaired functional status, and shorter survival. However, because CT-based body composition assessment requires outlining the different tissues in the image, which is timeconsuming, its practical value is currently limited. To form an estimate of body composition, different tissues are often segmented manually in a single 2D slice from the abdomen.
    For use in both routine care and in research studies, automatic segmentation of the different tissue types in the abdomen is desirable.
    This study focuses on the development and testing of an automatic approach to segment muscle and fat tissue in the entire abdomen. The four classes of interest are skeletal muscle (SM), inter-muscular adipose tissue (IMAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). A deep neural network is trained on two-dimensional CT slices at the level of the third lumbar vertebra. Three experiments were carried out with the goal of improving the network with information from other, unannotated data sources. Active learning methods were applied to sample additional data to annotate and include in the training of the model. The proposed algorithm combines two models to segment muscle and fat in the entire abdomen and achieves state-of-the-art results. Dice scores of 0.91, 0.84, 0.97, and 0.97 were attained for SM, IMAT, VAT, and SAT, respectively, averaged over five locations throughout the abdomen.},

  abstract = {Statistical shape models (SSM) are widely used in medical image analysis to represent variability in organ shape. However, representing subject-specific soft-tissue motion using this technique is problematic for applications where imaging organ changes in an individual is not possible or impractical. One solution is to synthesise training data by using biomechanical modelling. However, for many clinical applications, generating a biomechanical model of the organ(s) of interest is a non-trivial task that requires a significant amount of user-interaction to segment an image and create a finite element mesh. In this study, we investigate the impact of reducing the effort required to generate SSMs and the accuracy with which such models can predict tissue displacements within the prostate gland due to transrectal ultrasound probe pressure. In this approach, the finite element mesh is based on a simplified geometric representation of the organs. For example, the pelvic bone is represented by planar surfaces, or the number of distinct tissue compartments is reduced. Such representations are much easier to generate from images than a geometrically accurate mesh. The difference in the median root-mean-square displacement error between different SSMs of prostate was <0.2?mm. We conclude that reducing the geometric complexity of the training model in this way made little difference to the absolute accuracy of SSMs to recover tissue displacements. The implication is that SSMs of organ motion based on simulated training data may be generated using simplified geometric representations, which are much more compatible with the time constraints of clinical workflows.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {PURPOSE To assess the diagnostic accuracy of high resolution and transient fast DCEMR individually and both combined in discriminating benign and malignant masses using automatic computer assisted analysis. METHOD AND MATERIALS A set of 97 detected masses (fibroademas and invasive ductal carcinomas) was selected from a consecutive cohort of breast MR in 2008 and 2009. The MR scanning protocol included high temporal resolution combined with high spatial resolution imaging. The high temporal resolution images were acquired every 4.1s using a 3D TurboFLASH sequence during initial enhancement (Fast). The high spatial resolution images were acquired at a temporal resolution of 86s using a 3D FLASH sequence (HighRes). All the masses were annotated with a 3D spheroid volume covering the lesion extent. Subsequent analysis was fully automatic. The contrast enhanced region in of the annotation was segmented using Otsu thresholding followed by binary morphological operators. Each lesion was characterized by a set of features (2 HighRes + 3 Fast) comprising quartiles of relative enhancement, wash-out, and pharmacokinetic image voxel features within the enhancing lesion area. Image feature maps are automatically computed from the Fast and HighRes sequences using curve fitting and pharmacokinetic modeling. An ensemble Support Vector Machine classifier was trained to discriminate between benign and malignant lesions on each of the three feature sets: HighRes, Fast and HighRes+Fast. Using cross-validation and bootstrapping the area under the curve (AUC) for each set was estimated and compared using paired t-tests. RESULTS The diagnostic accuracy of the combined HighRes and Fast features was significantly (p<0.01) better than the HighRes features alone. The individual AUCs were: HighRes 0.78 (074-0.81); Fast 0.69 (0.66-0.72); HighRes+Fast 0.84 (0.82-0.87). CONCLUSION The increased diagnostic performance found when combining HighRes and Fast DCEMR demonstrates the additional value of our method in further improving the diagnostic performance of computerized analysis of breast MRI. This study shows that transient dynamic features from fast sequences provide additional information over conventional curve shape features in slower breast MR sequences. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Dual time resolution breast MR can improve diagnostic accuracy over conventional single resolution analysis which may help increase specificity.},

  abstract = {Abstract Quantitative analysis of contrast-enhanced dynamic MR images has potential for diagnosing prostate cancer. Contemporary fast acquisition techniques can give sufficiently high temporal resolution to sample the fast dynamics observed in the prostate. Data reduction for parametric visualization requires automatic curve fitting to a pharmacokinetic model, which to date has been performed using least-squares error minimization methods. We observed that these methods often produce unexpectedly noisy estimates, especially for the typically fast, intermediate parameters time-to-peak and start-of-enhancement, resulting in inaccurate pharmacokinetic parameter estimates. We developed a new curve fit method that focuses on the most probable slope. A set of 10 patients annotated using histopathology was used to compare the conventional and new methods. The results show that our new method is significantly more accurate, especially in the relatively less-enhancing periferal zone. We conclude that estimation accuracy depends on the curve fit method, which is especially important when evaluating the periferal zone of the prostate. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2001;13:607-614.

  abstract = {Theoretical estimates of the standard deviation (STD) of four acoustospectrographic parameters (the intercept and slope of attenuation and backscatter coefficient) are derived. This derivation expands and corrects existing derivations, and is confirmed using simulations based on the adopted theoretical model. A robust parameter estimation method is applied to various phantom measurements, and to in vivo liver scans of healthy human subjects. The measured STD is higher than the theoretically predicted value, and we investigated four possible factors which explain this discrepancy. First, it is shown that the STD and bias after spectrogram calculation are rather insensitive to changes in windowing function, type, length and overlap. Second, we observed that a diffraction correction spectrogram calibrated on a medium different from the one being measured insufficiently corrects the depth-dependency of the parameters, which affects both precision as well as accuracy. We therefore propose a method that constructs an organ-specific diffraction correction spectrogram from the averaged spectrogram of a set of normal organs. We show that the organ-specific correction does not affect STD even in case of previously unseen acquisitions. Third, we introduce local inhomogeneity, which predicts excess STD due to local variations of the physical parameters within an organ (i.e., intrasubject), and global inhomogeneity, which predicts variations between organs (i.e., intersubject). We conclude that our method of estimating STD predicts normal, in vivo data very well, and propose that the deviation from these estimates is a potential tissue characterization parameter.},

  abstract = {Ultrasonic imaging is a commonly used, powerful diagnostic technique in medicine. The images allow a physician to visualize anatomical details in the human body with the intention to assess the state of the anatomy. Since the introduction of the concept of gray-scale ultrasonic imaging in the early 70's, the number of applications has increased and the image quality is still being improved. More recently, UTC strategies are being developed to quantify information in the available image on the ultrasound machine or to visualize new information in additional images. The quantification of existing visual information may help physicians to enhance the robustness and reproducibility of their assessments. This thesis describes improved and/or new UTC strategies. This research was motivated by developments in related research areas. Continuing fundamental research in medical ultrasound has led to an increase in the understanding of the physical mechanisms that govern the image formation process. The resulting theoretical insights may enhance the amount of information that can be retrieved from ultrasonic images. Recent techniques in signal processing, image processing and pattern recognition facilitate the extraction and quantification of this information. More specific, artificial neural networks have shown promising results in related problems. Finally, actual application of these techniques seems realistic as contemporary computer speed- and memory has reached a sufficient level. This chapter starts with a demarcation of the ultrasonic tissue characterization (UTC) field of research. The subsequent section then briefly summarizes previous research on UTC. Finally, the problem definitions for the subsequent chapters in this thesis are formulated},

We show that an architecture that takes additional slices before and after the slice of interest as an additional input outperforms an architecture that processes single slices. From the slice-based analysis, a bounding box around the structures of interest can be computed. The system uses 6 convolutional, 4 pooling and one fully connected layer and uses 333 scans for training and 110 for validation. The test set contains 110 scans.

  abstract = {Automatic localization of organs and other structures in medical images is an important preprocessing step that can improve and speed up other algorithms such as organ segmentation, lesion detection, and registration. This work presents an efficient method for simultaneous localization of multiple structures in 3D thorax-abdomen CT scans. Our approach predicts the location of multiple structures using a single multi-label convolutional neural network for each orthogonal view. Each network takes extra slices around the current slice as input to provide extra context. A sigmoid layer is used to perform multi-label classification. The output of the three networks is subsequently combined to compute a 3D bounding box for each structure. We used our approach to locate 11 structures of interest. The neural network was trained and evaluated on a large set of 1884 thorax-abdomen CT scans from patients undergoing oncological workup. Reference bounding boxes were annotated by human observers. The performance of our method was evaluated by computing the wall distance to the reference bounding boxes. The bounding boxes annotated by the first human observer were used as the reference standard for the test set. Using the best configuration, we obtained an average wall distance of 3.20+-7.33mm in the test set. The second human observer achieved 1.23+-3.39mm. For all structures, the results were better than those reported in previously published studies. In conclusion, we proposed an efficient method for the accurate localization of multiple organs. Our method uses multiple slices as input to provide more context around the slice under analysis, and we have shown that this improves performance. This method can easily be adapted to handle more organs.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To develop a fully automated algorithm for spleen segmentation and to assess the performance of this algorithm in a large dataset. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, a three-dimensional deep learning network was developed to segment the spleen on thorax-abdomen CT scans. Scans were extracted from patients undergoing oncologic treatment from 2014 to 2017. A total of 1100 scans from 1100 patients were used in this study, and 400 were selected for development of the algorithm. For testing, a dataset of 50 scans was annotated to assess the segmentation accuracy and was compared against the splenic index equation. In a qualitative observer experiment, an enriched set of 100 scan-pairs was used to evaluate whether the algorithm could aid a radiologist in assessing splenic volume change. The reference standard was set by the consensus of two other independent radiologists. A Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to test whether there was a performance difference between the algorithm and the independent observer. Results: The algorithm and the independent observer obtained comparable Dice scores (P = .834) on the test set of 50 scans of 0.962 and 0.964, respectively. The radiologist had an agreement with the reference standard in 81% (81 of 100) of the cases after a visual classification of volume change, which increased to 92% (92 of 100) when aided by the algorithm. Conclusion: A segmentation method based on deep learning can accurately segment the spleen on CT scans and may help radiologists to detect abnormal splenic volumes and splenic volume changes.},

  abstract = {To detect breast cancers in an early stage, in most western countries screening programs are organized. A small fraction of the mammograms acquired in screening contain malignancies, which can be very subtle. In order to reduce oversight errors, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems have been developed. The effect of CAD techniques that are currently used in screening programs is not conclusive. The research described in this thesis had two goals. The first goal was to improve the performance of current CAD techniques for mass detection. The second goal was to investigate the use of CAD as decision support instead of perception aid.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We developed a computer-aided detection (CAD) system aimed at decision support for detection of malignant masses and architectural distortions in mammograms. The effect of this system on radiologists' performance depends strongly on its standalone performance. The purpose of this study was to compare the standalone performance of this CAD system to that of radiologists. METHODS: In a retrospective study, nine certified screening radiologists and three residents read 200 digital screening mammograms without the use of CAD. Performances of the individual readers and of CAD were computed as the true-positive fraction (TPF) at a false-positive fraction of 0.05 and 0.2. Differences were analysed using an independent one-sample t-test. RESULTS: At a false-positive fraction of 0.05, the performance of CAD (TPF?=?0.487) was similar to that of the certified screening radiologists (TPF?=?0.518, P?=?0.17). At a false-positive fraction of 0.2, CAD performance (TPF?=?0.620) was significantly lower than the radiologist performance (TPF?=?0.736, P <0.001). Compared to the residents, CAD performance was similar for all false-positive fractions. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of CAD at a high specificity was comparable to that of human readers. These results show potential for CAD to be used as an independent reader in breast cancer screening. KEY POINTS : A-A?A 1/2  Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems are used to detect malignant masses in mammograms A-A?A 1/2  Current CAD systems operate at low specificity to avoid perceptual oversight A-A?A 1/2  A CAD system has been developed that operates at high specificity A-A?A 1/2  The performance of the CAD system is approaching that of trained radiologists A-A?A 1/2  CAD has the potential to be an independent reader in screening.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To compare effectiveness of an interactive computer-aided detection (CAD) system, in which CAD marks and their associated suspiciousness scores remain hidden unless their location is queried by the reader, with the effect of traditional CAD prompts used in current clinical practice for the detection of malignant masses on full-field digital mammograms. Materials and Methods: The requirement for institutional review board approval was waived for this retrospective observer study. Nine certified screening radiologists and three residents who were trained in breast imaging read 200 studies (63 studies containing at least one screen-detected mass, 17 false-negative studies, 20 false-positive studies, and 100 normal studies) twice, once with CAD prompts and once with interactive CAD. Localized findings were reported and scored by the readers. In the prompted mode, findings were recorded before and after activation of CAD. The partial area under the location receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for an interval of low false-positive fractions typical for screening, from 0 to 0.2, was computed for each reader and each mode. Differences in reader performance were analyzed by using software. Results: The average partial area under the location ROC curve with unaided reading was 0.57, and it increased to 0.62 with interactive CAD, while it remained unaffected by prompts. The difference in reader performance for unaided reading versus interactive CAD was statistically significant (P = .009). Conclusion: When used as decision support, interactive use of CAD for malignant masses on mammograms may be more effective than the current use of CAD, which is aimed at the prevention of perceptual oversights.},

  abstract = {{A}therosclerosis is the leading cause of death and disability in the {W}estern world. {A}rterial calcifications are a marker of the disease and can be detected with computed tomography ({CT}) scans. {I}n this thesis automatic methods for {CT} calcium scoring are presented. {I}n {CT} scans calcifications appear as bright structures, and therefore they were extracted by thresholding and component labeling. {H}owever, other high-density objects, such as noise, bony structures, and metal implants were selected by this process as well. {T}o identify true calcifications among all candidate objects, each object was described by features. {T}hose features were derived from the candidate object's location, its appearance, its shape and its size. {S}ubsequently, a pattern recognition approach was used to identify true calcifications among all extracted candidate objects. {A} first study considered aortic calcifications in {CTA} scans of the abdomen. {A}ll high-density objects in the scan were considered and separated by a pattern recognition system. {I}n terms of the number of calcifications the method resulted in a sensitivity of 83.9% at the expense of on average 1.0 false positive objects per scan. {T}he scan was assigned to one of four categories ("no", "small", "moderate" or "large" amounts of calcification). {T}he correct category label was assigned to 75.0% of scans. {A} similar approach was used for automatic coronary calcium scoring in non-contrast enhanced, {ECG}-gated multi-slice {CT} data. {H}ere, the analysis was performed on the cardiac volume only. {I}n addition to the previously mentioned characteristics, features were also derived from a segmentation of the heart and the aorta, which were extracted automatically using a rule-based scheme. {A}n {A}gatston score was computed for each scan and subjects were assigned a risk category (0-10, 11-100, 101-400, >400). {T}he correct category was assigned to 93.4% of subjects. {A}ccurate segmentation of the heart and the aorta boundary were found to be essential for the performance of the coronary calcium scoring system. {R}obust segmentation of these structures is challenging, and therefore a general multi-atlas-based segmentation method was developed. {T}he method was tested on the segmentation of the heart and the aorta in low-dose, non-gated, non-contrast enhanced {CT} scans of the thorax. {T}he proposed method yielded results very close to those of an independent human observer. {M}oreover, atlas selection led to faster segmentation at comparable performance. {F}inally, using the results of the multi-atlas-based segmentation, a system for automatic detection of calcifications in the aorta was developed. {I}n this study the same low-dose, non-gated, non-contrast enhanced {CT} scans of the thorax were used. {S}uch scans are acquired in lung cancer screening trials and it would be worthwhile to perform calcium scoring in these scans, especially if this could be done automatically. {A} pattern recognition system was applied to the segmented aortic volume. {A} correct risk category was assigned to 88.3% of subjects. {I}n conclusion, this thesis presents several systems for computerized detection of arterial calcifications. {I}t is shown that automated calcium scoring is possible and can be used for risk category determination.},

  abstract = {{P}urpose: {L}ung cancer screening trials may provide information about cardiovascular risk. {I}t is not yet clear whether coronary scores from non-gated scans or aortic scores are more suited for this purpose. {W}e examined whether risk stratification based on aortic calcifications places patients into similar groups as risk based on coronary calcium scores derived from non-gated lung cancer screening studies. {M}ethod and materials: {W}e included 1091 baseline scans from subjects participating in a lung cancer screening trial ({NELSON}). {S}cans had been acquired at two centers using 16 x 0.75 mm collimation and a low-dose, non-contrast, non-{ECG}-gated scanning protocol. {T}o control image noise, 3mm sections were reconstructed every 1.4mm. {A}ortic and coronary calcifications were scored by two observers (130 {HU} threshold). {F}or coronary calcifications four atherosclerotic risk categories were defined based on {A}gatston score (?10, 11-100, 101-400, >400). {S}ince no categorization is available for aortic scores we assigned four categories, each containing the same number of subjects as the respective coronary categories. {T}o assess the agreement, we calculated linearly weighted kappa statistics (categories) and {S}pearman rank correlation coefficients (scores). {R}esults: {T}he number of subjects was 327, 156, 175 and 433 in the four coronary risk categories, respectively. {T}he aortic calcium score assigned 526 (48%) subjects to the same risk category as the coronary score. {L}inearly weighted kappa statistic was 0.37, and {S}pearman rank correlation between scores was 0.51. {C}onclusion: {W}hile yielding similar results, aortic and coronary calcium scores cannot be used interchangeably for assessing individual arteriosclerotic risk from lung cancer screening studies.},

  abstract = {{PURPOSE}: {T}horacic computed tomography ({CT}) scans provide information about cardiovascular risk status. {T}hese scans are non-{ECG} synchronized, thus precise quantification of coronary calcifications is difficult. {A}ortic calcium scoring is less sensitive to cardiac motion, so it is an alternative to coronary calcium scoring as an indicator of cardiovascular risk. {T}he authors developed and evaluated a computer-aided system for automatic detection and quantification of aortic calcifications in low-dose noncontrast-enhanced chest {CT}. {METHODS}: {T}he system was trained and tested on scans from participants of a lung cancer screening trial. {A} total of 433 low-dose, non-{ECG}-synchronized, noncontrast-enhanced 16 detector row examinations of the chest was randomly divided into 340 training and 93 test data sets. {A} first observer manually identified aortic calcifications on training and test scans. {A} second observer did the same on the test scans only. {F}irst, a multiatlas-based segmentation method was developed to delineate the aorta. {S}egmented volume was thresholded and potential calcifications (candidate objects) were extracted by three-dimensional connected component labeling. {D}ue to image resolution and noise, in rare cases extracted candidate objects were connected to the spine. {T}hey were separated into a part outside and parts inside the aorta, and only the latter was further analyzed. {A}ll candidate objects were represented by 63 features describing their size, position, and texture. {S}ubsequently, a two-stage classification with a selection of features and k-nearest neighbor classifiers was performed. {B}ased on the detected aortic calcifications, total calcium volume score was determined for each subject. {RESULTS}: {T}he computer system correctly detected, on the average, 945 mm3 out of 965 mm3 (97.9\%) calcified plaque volume in the aorta with an average of 64 mm3 of false positive volume per scan. {S}pearman rank correlation coefficient was p = 0.960 between the system and the first observer compared to p = 0.961 between the two observers. {CONCLUSIONS}: {A}utomatic calcium scoring in the aorta thus appears feasible with good correlation between manual and automatic scoring.},

  title = {Automatic Coronary Calcium Scoring in Low-Dose Non-{ECG}-synchronized Chest Computed Tomography ({CT}) Scans from a Lung Cancer Screening Trial},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: Coronary calcium scores from lung cancer screening computed tomography (CT) have been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular events. Given the large number of cases and the inherent large variability induced by motion artifacts on these non-gated scans, automatic calcium scoring might be a feasible option. We therefore evaluated the performance of automatic coronary calcium scoring in this setting. METHOD AND MATERIALS: We included 1796 baseline scans from the Nelson trial, a lung cancer screening program with low-dose chest CT (16 x 0.75 mm, 30 mAs, no IV contrast, no ECG synchronization). All scans were reconstructed to 3.1 mm-sections with 1.4 mm increment. Scans with beam hardening artifacts due to metal implants were identified and excluded. Automatic calcium scoring was performed using a method based on multi-atlas registration and pattern recognition. Each scan was inspected by one of four trained observers. When needed, the observers corrected automatically identified calcifications. Because stents could not be securely differentiated, they were scored as calcifications. Agatston and volume scores were computed for the automatic method and after manual correction. Each subject was assigned to a cardiovascular risk category based on the Agatston score. To estimate the interobserver agreement, a subset of 45 scans was manually scored by two observers. Spearman's rank correlation was computed to assess the agreement between the automatically and manually corrected volume scores, and between observers. Linearly weighted kappa statistic was calculated to evaluate the agreement in cardiovascular risk category assignments. RESULTS: The mean volume score was 534 mm3 (range:0-11,778 mm3) based on the manually corrected scores. Fourteen (0.8%) scans with large metal implants had to be excluded. We found a correlation ? of 0.88 and an agreement ? of 0.79 between the automatic and manually corrected scores. Interobserver agreement resulted in ? = 0.89, and ? = 0.83. CONCLUSION: Fully automatic coronary calcium scoring in a lung cancer screening program is feasible. Agreement of automatic scores with observer scores is similar to interobserver agreement. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: Automatic estimation of cardiovascular risk in lung cancer screening can expand the scope of screening and help identify high-risk subjects who might benefit from preventive cardiovascular treatment.},

  abstract = {The calcium burden as estimated from non-ECGsynchronized CT exams acquired in screening of heavy smokers has been shown to be a strong predictor of cardiovascular events. We present a method for automatic coronary calcium scoring with low-dose, non-contrast-enhanced, non-ECG-synchronized chest CT. First, a probabilistic coronary calcium map was created using multi-atlas segmentation. This map assigned an a priori probability for the presence of coronary calcifications at every location in a scan. Subsequently, a statistical pattern recognition system was designed to identify coronary calcifications by texture, size and spatial features; the spatial features were computed using the coronary calcium map. The detected calcifications were quantified in terms of volume and Agatston score. The best results were obtained by merging the results of three different supervised classification systems, namely direct classification with a nearest neighbor classifier, and two-stage classification with nearest neighbor and support vector machine classifiers. We used a total of 231 test scans containing 45,674 mm3 of coronary calcifications. The presented method detected on average 157/198 mm3 (sensitivity 79.2%) of coronary calcium volume with on average 4 mm3 false positive volume. Calcium scoring can be performed automatically in lowdose, non-contrast enhanced, non-ECG-synchronized chest CT in screening of heavy smokers to identify subjects who might benefit from preventive treatment.},

  abstract = {Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a progressive neurological disease affecting myelin pathways in the brain. Multiple lesions in the white matter can cause paralysis and severe motor disabilities of the affected patient. To solve the issue of inconsistency and user-dependency in manual lesion measurement of MRI, we have proposed a 3-D automated lesion quantification algorithm to enable objective and efficient lesion volume tracking. The computer-aided detection (CAD) of MS, written in MATLAB, utilizes K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method to compute the probability of lesions on a per-voxel basis. Despite the highly optimized algorithm of imaging processing that is used in CAD development, MS CAD integration and evaluation in clinical workflow is technically challenging due to the requirement of high computation rates and memory bandwidth in the recursive nature of the algorithm. In this paper, we present the development and evaluation of using a computing engine in the graphical processing unit (GPU) with MATLAB for segmentation of MS lesions. The paper investigates the utilization of a high-end GPU for parallel computing of KNN in the MATLAB environment to improve algorithm performance. The integration is accomplished using NVIDIA's CUDA developmental toolkit for MATLAB. The results of this study will validate the practicality and effectiveness of the prototype MS CAD in a clinical setting. The GPU method may allow MS CAD to rapidly integrate in an electronic patient record or any disease-centric health care system.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The chronic nature of MS necessitates multiple MRI studies to track disease progression. Currently, MRI assessment of multiple sclerosis requires manual lesion measurement and yields an estimate of lesion volume and change that is highly variable and user-dependent. In the setting of a longitudinal study, disease trends and changes become difficult to extrapolate from the lesions. In addition, it is difficult to establish a correlation between these imaged lesions and clinical factors such as treatment course. To address these clinical needs, an MS specific e-Folder for decision support in the evaluation and assessment of MS has been developed. An e-Folder is a disease-centric electronic medical record in contrast to a patient-centric electronic health record. Along with an MS lesion computer aided detection (CAD) package for lesion load, location, and volume, clinical parameters such as patient demographics, disease history, clinical course, and treatment history are incorporated to make the e-Folder comprehensive. With the integration of MRI studies together with related clinical data and informatics tools designed for monitoring multiple sclerosis, it provides a platform to improve the detection of treatment response in patients with MS. The design and deployment of MS e-Folder aims to standardize MS lesion data and disease progression to aid in decision making and MS-related research.},

  abstract = {Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a common neurological disease affecting the central nervous system characterized by pathologic changes including demyelination and axonal injury. MR imaging has become the most important tool to evaluate the disease progression of MS which is characterized by the occurrence of white matter lesions. Currently, radiologists evaluate and assess the multiple sclerosis lesions manually by estimating the lesion volume and amount of lesions. This process is extremely time-consuming and sensitive to intra- and inter-observer variability. Therefore, there is a need for automatic segmentation of the MS lesions followed by lesion quantification. We have developed a fully automatic segmentation algorithm to identify the MS lesions. The segmentation algorithm is accelerated by parallel computing using Graphics Processing Units (GPU) for practical implementation into a clinical environment. Subsequently, characterized quantification of the lesions is performed. The quantification results, which include lesion volume and amount of lesions, are stored in a structured report together with the lesion location in the brain to establish a standardized representation of the disease progression of the patient. The development of this structured report in collaboration with radiologists aims to facilitate outcome analysis and treatment assessment of the disease and will be standardized based on DICOM-SR. The results can be distributed to other DICOM-compliant clinical systems that support DICOM-SR such as PACS. In addition, the implementation of a fully automatic segmentation and quantification system together with a method for storing, distributing, and visualizing key imaging and informatics data in DICOM-SR for MS lesions improves the clinical workflow of radiologists and visualizations of the lesion segmentations and will provide 3-D insight into the distribution of lesions in the brain.},

  abstract = {{PURPOSE} : Ground glass nodules (GGNs) occur less frequent in computed tomography (CT) scans than solid nodules but have a much higher chance of being malignant. Therefore, accurate detection of these nodules is highly important. A complete system for computer-aided detection (CAD) of GGNs is presented and evaluated on an independent data set to determine its potential to be implemented in a clinical setting. {METHOD} {AND} {MATERIALS}: Data for this study was collected from 10,000 low dose chest CT scans (16x0.75mm, 120-140 kVp, 30 mAs) from a large lung cancer screening trial. All examinations in which at least one GGN was annotated were collected. This resulted in 140 scans. This set is extended with 60 randomly selected scans in which two radiologists confirmed the absence of GGNs. Training and optimization of the CAD system was performed using 67 scans each containing one or more GGNs, 91 in total. The CAD system was independently tested using FROC analysis on the remaining 133 scans, 73 with and 60 without GGNs, containing 85 GGNs in total. The detection pipeline is initiated with a robust lung and airway segmentation. The CAD system extracts ground glass voxels by applying a double-threshold density mask (-750 to -300 HU) to the lung regions. A morphological opening operation, connected component analysis and a size criterion define GGN candidates. Classification of candidates is accomplished using a two-stage classification process. First, a linear discriminant classifier using 2 shape and 2 intensity features is employed. Next, a GentleBoost classifier is applied to the remaining candidates using a rich set of 161 features that describe the intensity, shape and spatial position of candidates relative to the airways and lung boundary. {RESULTS}: Candidate extraction resulted in 560 ? 306 candidate regions per scan. On average, 32% of the candidate regions remained after the first classification stage. The CAD system achieved a sensitivity of 60% and 74% at 0.25 and 1 false positive detections per scan, respectively. Most false negatives were missed in the candidate detection stage.{CONCLUSION}: Computer-aided detection of ground glass nodules is feasible with high sensitivity at a low false positive rate. {CLINICAL} {RELEVANCE}/{APPLICATION}: Ground glass nodules are easily missed in chest CT scans. Computer-aided detection can reach high sensitivity at low false positive rates and is therefore a potentially useful aid for radiologists.},

Ground glass nodules may or may not have a solid component and it has been shown that they have a much higher chance of being malignant in comparison to solid nodules. Computer-aided detection ({CAD}) systems designed for solid nodules perform poorly on detection of ground glass nodules, and vice versa. Therefore, a {CAD} system that combines the output of two prototype {CAD} systems aimed at detection of ground glass nodules and solid nodules, respectively, could lead to efficient detection of the entire spectrum of lung nodules in chest {CT} scans. In this study, we combine the output of two prototype {CAD} systems and show results on a data set of 73 {CT} examinations containing both solid and ground glass nodules. The main category of nodules which are found by both {CAD} systems are ground glass nodules with a solid component.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Ground glass nodules ({GGN}s) have a high probability of being malignant. We retrospectively investigated the usefulness of a dedicated computer-aided detection (CAD) system for GGNs in a clinical screening setting. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A set of 620 low-dose chest {CT} scans (16x0.75mm, 120-140 kVp, 30 mAs) were randomly selected from a lung cancer screening trial. All scans were processed with a research prototype {CAD} system for {GGN}s (Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, Fraunhofer {MEVIS}, Bremen, Germany). Two chest radiologists inspected all {CAD} marks and classified them as {GGN}, other lesion, or false positive. Findings were compared with the annotations recorded in the screening trial database, which were obtained without the support of {CAD}. RESULTS: {GGN} {CAD} found 386 marks (0.62 per scan). Radiologist 1 classified 22 marks as {GGN}, 222 as other lesions and 142 as false positives. For radiologist 2 these numbers were 39, 107, and 240, respectively. Fifteen findings were considered to be {GGN}s by both radiologists. Of these 15, only 3 had been annotated in the screening trial. {CAD} marks that were classified by the radiologists as other lesions involved mainly scars and areas of inflammation. A common source of {CAD} false positives were hazy opacities caused by cardiac motion. CONCLUSION: At less than 0.7 false positives per scan, the {CAD} system can substantially increase the number of {GGN}s identified in a lung cancer screening trial at a false positive rate that does not impose a burden on the reading process.},

  abstract = {Performing coronary artery calcium (CAC) screening as part of low-dose CT lung cancer screening has been proposed as an efficient strategy to detect people with high cardiovascular risk and improve outcomes of primary prevention. This study aims to investigate whether CAC measured on low-dose CT in a population of former and current heavy smokers is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and cardiac events.We used a case-cohort study and included 958 subjects 50 years old or older within the screen group of a randomized controlled lung cancer screening trial. We used Cox proportional-hazard models to compute hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors to predict all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events.During a median follow-up of 21.5 months, 56 deaths and 127 cardiovascular events occurred. Compared with a CAC score of 0, multivariate-adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality for CAC scores of 1-100, 101-1000, and more than 1000 were 3.00 (95\% CI, 0.61-14.93), 6.13 (95\% CI, 1.35-27.77), and 10.93 (95\% CI, 2.36-50.60), respectively. Multivariate-adjusted HRs for coronary events were 1.38 (95\% CI, 0.39-4.90), 3.04 (95\% CI, 0.95-9.73), and 7.77 (95\% CI, 2.44-24.75), respectively.This study shows that CAC scoring as part of low-dose CT lung cancer screening can be used as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events.},

  abstract = {{PURPOSE} : Most nodule CAD systems perform poorly for detection of subsolid pulmonary nodules since they are primarily developed for detection of solid nodules. To overcome this problem, a combination of CAD systems for solid and subsolid nodule detection is proposed and evaluated on a database containing a large amount of subsolid and solid nodules. {METHOD} {AND} {MATERIALS}: Low-dose chest CT scans (16x0.75mm, 120-140 kVp, 30 mAs) were selected from the database of the Dutch-Belgian NELSON lung cancer screening trial in which either a subsolid nodule or a solid nodule with a diameter between 7mm and 30mm was present. In this way, 109 scans with 33 non-solid, 37 part-solid, and 52 large solid nodules meeting the criteria were included. In total, the scans contained 327 solid, 42 part-solid and 33 non-solid nodules. All chest CT scans were processed using a solid nodule CAD system and subsolid CAD system (Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, Fraunhofer MEVIS, Bremen, Germany). Both systems were trained on an independent dataset. FROC analysis was performed to evaluate the performance of the solid nodule CAD system, the subsolid CAD system and the combination of the both CAD systems. The CAD systems were combined based on operating points on the FROC curve. Since the prevalence of subsolid nodules in a screening population is approximately four times lower than of solid nodules, for each operating point of the solid nodule CAD system we selected an operating point of the subsolid CAD system with a four times lower false-positive rate. Subsequently, findings of both CAD systems are merged and this generates the output of the combined CAD. {RESULTS}: FROC analysis showed that at an average of four false positives per scan, the solid nodule CAD system reached a sensitivity of 59% and the subsolid nodule CAD system reached 27%. At this false positive level the combination of the two systems led to a sensitivity of 66%. At an average of 8 false positives per scan, the sensitivities were 69%, 30% and 76%, respectively. {CONCLUSION}: The combination of a solid nodule CAD system and subsolid CAD system substantially increases the sensitivity for detection of pulmonary nodules. {CLINICAL} {RELEVANCE}/{APPLICATION}: Given the high malignancy rates of subsolid nodules, it is important that computer-aided detection systems detect both solid and subsolid nodules.},

  year = {2012},
  abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Today, lung cancer is the most common and most deadly cancer in men and women worldwide. The recent positive results of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) [1] have provided clear scientific evidence that screening with low dose chest CT reduces lung cancer mortality. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network has updated their recommendations for screening and now strongly recommend the use of low-dose CT screening for individuals at high risk for lung cancer [2]. At least one health insurance company has started to cover the cost of lung screening. In its current form, however, large scale introduction of CT lung screening would put an enormous burden on radiologists. Building upon our clinical and technical experience in reading, image analysis and data processing for large screening trials in Europe (over 30,000 CT scans from 10,000 participants) and a careful review of the existing commercially available lung workstations, we have developed a new dedicated chest reading workstation with a number of innovations that allows for an optimized high throughput workflow to report on low dose chest CT scans. The application is currently available as a research prototype and is in use at five sites. It is used in clinical research and includes automated detection, linking, volumetry, interval change analysis, and estimation of malignancy for each nodule finding. A structured report for each patient is produced with follow-up recommendations according to several guidelines, including the upcoming revised Fleischner Society guidelines for the management of pulmonary nodules. {METHODOLOGY/APPLICATION} The workstation that will be demonstrated includes a number of innovations and enhancements compared to currently commercially available software. - Each scan is preprocessed and scan quality is automatically assessed. Scans with low quality, artifacts or underlying interstitial lung disease are automatically flagged. - Each scan is elastically registered to all prior scans of the same patient. Findings in prior scans are propagated and linked to findings in the current scan. All scans and processing results are preloaded in the background to ensure rapid reading. - Highly effective computerized detection (CAD) of solid nodules [3] and sub-solid nodules [4] is integrated. - High throughput reading with CAD as a first reader is supported. Users can accept/reject at a setting of on average 10 to 15 candidate lesions per scan and thus report much quicker than traditional thin sliding MIP viewing of the entire volume (also supported). - Each nodule is automatically characterized as solid, part-solid, or non-solid and nodules with benign characteristics are automatically flagged. Detected benign characteristics include calcifications and peri-fissural opacities (lymph nodes). - Volumetry, volume growth rate, mass and mass growth rate are automatically computed with advanced segmentation algorithms [5] that have been extended to handle sub-solid lesions and segment the solid core of part-solid nodules. If necessary, the user can interactively adjust segmentations and compare side by side with the corresponding finding in all available prior scans to detect and correct segmentation inconsistencies. - Findings are summarized in a structured report in HTML and PDF format that is stored in the database and can be sent to requesting physicians. Follow-up recommendation according to various screening algorithms and guidelines of leading Societies are included. {DEMONSTRATION STRATEGY} The exhibit will be accompanied by an informational poster that will highlight the key differences between the proposed workflow and current clinical practice. The poster will also explain algorithmic concepts that underlie the automated analysis. Attendees will be able to gain hands-on experience with the workstation and read cases and use nodule detection, automated and interactive volumetry, see the results of classification of different nodule types and produce structured reports with follow-up recommendations, all within

  title = {Automated characterization of pulmonary nodules in thoracic {CT} images using a segmentation-based classification system},
  booktitle = ECR,
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: Clinical guidelines for follow-up of pulmonary nodules depend on nodule type and therefore accurate characterization of nodules is important. A novel computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to distinguish solid, part-solid and non-solid nodules is presented and evaluated on a large data set from a lung cancer screening trial. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The automated characterization system is based on a previously published nodule segmentation algorithm. Four different parameter settings were used to extract the solid part, non-solid part and solid core of the lesion. For each segmentation, volume, mass, average density, 5th percentile and 95th percentile of densities inside the segmentation were used as features. A k-nearest-neighbor classifier was used to classify nodules. The accuracy of the system to differentiate between solid and subsolid nodules, between solid, part-solid and non-solid nodules and between part-solid and non-solid nodules was evaluated. A data set consisting of 137 low-dose chest CT scans (16x0.75mm, 120-140 kVp, 30 mAs) with 52 solid, 50 part-solid and 50 non-solid nodules was collected from a screening trial. The nodule type recorded in the screening database was used as the reference standard. Experiments were performed in leave-one-nodule-out cross-validation. RESULTS: The accuracy of CAD to differentiate between solid and subsolid nodules was 0.88. Differentiation into solid, part-solid and non-solid nodules gave an accuracy of 0.72. CAD had an accuracy of 0.71 in differentiating part-solid from non-solid nodules. CONCLUSION: Automated characterization of pulmonary nodules shows good performance. This can aid radiologists to decide on appropriate workup in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Classifying pulmonary nodules into solid, part-solid and non-solid is crucial for patient management. A computer algorithm is compared to a radiologist on a large data set obtained from a multi-center lung cancer screening trial. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Low-dose chest CT scans (16x0.75mm, 120-140 kVp, 30 mAs) with part-solid, non-solid, and solid nodules with a diameter between 7 and 30 mm, were randomly selected from two sites participating in the Dutch-Belgian NELSON lung cancer screening trial. The set contained 137 scans, including 50 part-solid, 50 non-solid and 52 solid nodules. The nodule type recorded in the screening database was used as a reference standard. An automated classification system for characterization of nodules was designed using morphometric features. The accuracy of the computer algorithm was evaluated in three ways: classifying nodules (1) as solid or subsolid, (2) as solid, part-solid or non-solid, and, (3) for the subsolid lesions only, as part-solid or non-solid. An experienced thoracic radiologist independently performed the same classification. RESULTS: The accuracy of the automated system to differentiate between solid and subsolid nodules was 0.88, compared to 0.95 for the radiologist. The computer classified the nodules as solid, part-solid or non-solid with an accuracy of 0.72, versus 0.80 for the radiologist. The software reached an accuracy of 0.71 in differentiating part-solid from non-solid nodules, where the radiologist had an accuracy of 0.77.

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {PURPOSE The recently completed {LIDC/IDRI} database provides by far the largest public resource to assess the performance of algorithms for the detection of pulmonary nodules in thoracic {CT} scans. We report the performance of two detection systems, and address the issue of completeness of the reference standard. METHOD AND MATERIALS The {LIDC/IDRI} database contains 890 thoracic {CT} scans with section thickness of 2.5mm or lower, one per patient, from 7 centers acquired with 17 different scanner models from 4 manufacturers. Cases have been annotated in an extensive reading process comprising a blinded and an unblinded review by four radiologists who indicated all nodules <3mm and >3mm effective diameter. We define nodules >3mm indicated by all four observers as positive findings. We applied two pulmonary nodule detection systems: {H}erakles, an industry research prototype (MeVis Medical Solutions, Bremen, Germany) and {ISICAD} (Image Sciences Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands), a system trained with data from the Dutch-Belgian {NELSON} lung cancer screening trial. We report sensitivity at 1, 2, and 4 false positive ({FP}) detections per scan and analyze the {FP}s. RESULTS The 890 scans contained 775 positive findings. At 1, 2, and 4 FP/scan, Herakles had a sensitivity of 69%, 75%, and 79%, respectively. For ISICAD this was 51%, 63%, 72%. We analyzed the {FP}s of {H}erakles at an operating point of 2 {FP}/scan. Of these, 31% were annotated by at least one radiologist as a nodule >3mm. An additional 17% were indicated by at least one radiologist as a nodule <3mm. A human expert visually inspected the remaining {FP}s using multiple slices of all three orthogonal views. A substantial part of these marks (41%) were located on nodular lesions that had not been indicated by any of the four radiologists involved in the annotation of the {LIDC/IDRI} data set . CONCLUSION The {LIDC/IDRI} data set is an excellent benchmarking tool for nodule detection algorithms. Automated detection can identify pulmonary nodules that have not been annotated in an extensive reading process with blinded and unblinded review by four human observers. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Algorithms for automatic detection of pulmonary nodules can be compared and improved through the availability of a common database for benchmarking.},

Therefore, accurate detection of this type of pulmonary nodules is crucial. In this work, a computer-aided detection (CAD) system for subsolid nodules in computed tomography images is presented and evaluated on a large data set from a multi-center lung cancer screening trial. The paper describes the different components of the CAD system and presents experiments to optimize the performance of the proposed CAD system. A rich set of 128 features is defined for subsolid nodule candidates. In addition to previously used intensity, shape and texture features, a novel set of context features is introduced. Experiments show that these features significantly improve the classification performance. Optimization and training of the CAD system is performed on a large training set from one site of a lung cancer screening trial. Performance analysis on an independent test from another site of the trial shows that the proposed system reaches a sensitivity of 80% at an average of only 1.0 false positive detections per scan. A retrospective analysis of the output of the CAD system by an experienced thoracic radiologist shows that the CAD system is able to find subsolid nodules which were not contained in the screening database.},

Study lesions were randomly selected from 2 sites participating in the Dutch-Belgian NELSON lung cancer screening trial. On the basis of the annotations made by the screening radiologists, 50 part-solid and 50 non-solid pulmonary nodules with a diameter between 5 and 30 mm were randomly selected from the 2 sites. For each unique nodule, 1 low-dose chest computed tomographic scan was randomly selected, in which the nodule was visible. In addition, 50 solid nodules in the same size range were randomly selected. A completely automatic 3-dimensional segmentation-based classification system was developed, which analyzes the pulmonary nodule, extracting intensity-, texture-, and segmentation-based features to perform a statistical classification. In addition to the nodule classification by the screening radiologists, an independent rating of all nodules by 3 experienced thoracic radiologists was performed. Performance of CAD was evaluated by comparing the agreement between CAD and human experts and among human experts using the Cohen AZAo statistics.Pairwise agreement for the differentiation between solid, part-solid, and non-solid nodules between CAD and each of the human experts had a AZAo range between 0.54 and 0.72. The interobserver agreement among the human experts was in the same range (AZAo range, 0.56-0.81). A novel automated classification tool for pulmonary nodules achieved good agreement with the human experts, yielding AZAo values in the same range as the interobserver agreement.

  abstract = {Automatic analysis of thoracic CT scans has the potential to improve detection rate of pulmonary nodules, reduce interobserver variability and speed up evaluation of screening CT scans. This however strongly depends on the performance of CAD systems. If the performance is good enough, it will probably positively influence the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer CT screening. This thesis presents novel algorithms to find abnormalities in thoracic CT images, which may be of benefit in the interpretation of chest CTs in lung cancer screening or clinical practice in general. The main focus of the thesis is automatic detection of pulmonary nodules in thoracic CT. The outline of this thesis is as follows. Chapter 2 describes a novel computer-aided detection system for subsolid pulmonary nodules. Detection of subsolid nodules has increased due to the use of thin-slice CT and the implementation of lung cancer screening trials and as a consequence, their prevalence and malignancy rate are better understood. Subsolid nodules are less common, but show a higher malignancy rate than solid nodules. We present a novel subsolid CAD system which is trained and validated with data from two sites from the NELSON lung cancer screening trial. In Chapter 3, a nodule detection system is developed for the detection of micronodules in subjects at high-risk for developing silicosis. Chronic silicosis is radiologically characterized by widespread, well-defined solid pulmonary micronodules, measuring 3 mm or less. Early detection is crucial to stop progression but detection and quantification of these small nodules is tedious for human observers. We present an automatic method which finds micronodules and quantifies the micronodule load. Chapter 4 describes a study in which we perform a comparative study of state-of-the-art nodule CAD systems on the largest publicly available reference data set, containing more than 1,000 CT scans. We perform an extensive analysis of the performance of three state-of-the-art CAD systems; two commercial and one academic CAD system. In Chapter 5, an automatic classification system for pulmonary nodules detected on CT is presented. Every nodule is classified as either solid, part-solid, or non-solid. This classification is crucial for management of pulmonary nodules. To put the performance of CAD into context, we also assess the interobserver variability among radiologists in this chapter. In Chapter 6, a system for automatic detection of interval change on consecutive CT scans is proposed. Interval change is of major importance when subjects are screened repeatedly. We propose an automatic detection system based on subtraction images which are acquired by employing an elastic registration method between consecutive CT images. Chapter 7 discusses how the presented algorithms could be efficiently integrated into software that could be used in clinical routine or in CT lung screening programs.},

  title = {An observer study comparing radiologists with the prize-winning lung cancer detection algorithms from the 2017 Kaggle Data Science Bowl},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: The 2017 Kaggle Data Science Bowl challenge awarded 1 million dollars in prize money to develop computer algorithms for predicting, on the basis of a single low-dose screening CT scan, which individuals will be diagnosed with lung cancer within one year of the scan. Participating teams received a training set of around 1500 low-dose CT scans to develop and train their algorithms and final performance was measured on a test set of 500 scans, containing 151 lung cancer cases. Over 2000 teams submitted results. The best 10 algorithms all used deep learning and are freely available as open source code. To gain insight into how the performance of these algorithms compares to radiologists, we conducted an observer study including 11 readers who read 150 cases from the test set. METHOD AND MATERIALS: We randomly extracted 100 benign cases and 50 lung cancer cases from the test set of the challenge. Each algorithm scored each test case with a score between 0 (low) and 1 (high) for harboring a malignancy. We developed a web-accessible workstation in which human experts could review chest CT scans. The web workstation included the common tools found in a professional medical viewing workstation. We invited 11 readers, a mix of radiologists and radiology residents, to read these 150 CT cases and assign a score between 0 (low) and 100 (high) whether the patient will develop a lung cancer within one year of the presented scan. ROC analysis was used to compare the performance of the human readers with the algorithms. The primary outcome was area under the ROC curve. 95% confidence intervals were computed by 1000 bootstrap iterations and are reported between brackets. RESULTS: The mean area under the ROC curve for the human readers was 0.90 [0.85-0.94]. The mean area under the ROC curve for the algorithms was 0.86 [0.81-0.91]. The mean human reading time per case varied between 96 and 275 seconds. CONCLUSION: The top 10 algorithms from the Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017 showed promising performance, but were still inferior to human readers. Future analysis will focus on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the computer algorithms and the human readers and how these can be optimally combined. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: Fully automatic algorithms using deep learning developed in a large-scale challenge show promising performance for lung cancer detection in chest CT, but performed inferior to radiologists in this subset of the test set.},

  abstract = {BODY: The success of deep learning, the implementation of lung cancer screening, and recent public challenges have created a revived interest for research of automatic nodule detection and characterization algorithms. In this talk, I will give an overview of deep learning for nodule detection and characterization. Public challenges, such as the LUNA16 challenge and the Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017 challenge, and publicly available databases have been drivers for development of novel deep learning algorithms and the performance of these novel algorithms is very promising. However, there are remaining challenges that need to be solved. Almost all approaches still rely on only one scan, while a radiologist typically looks at all available scans and the clinical history of the patient. Next to this, integration of these algorithms into clinical practice is still not easy, and validation of algorithms on larger datasets and real-world data are needed to further validate these algorithms. TAKE HOME POINTS: 1) LUNA16 and Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017 have shown the potential for deep learning for nodule detection and deep learning. 2) Integration of these algorithms into clinical practice is still suboptimal. 3) Validation of these algorithms on larger and modern datasets is needed to further validate these algorithms.},

  abstract = {Purpose To compare the inter- and intraobserver agreement and reading times achieved when assigning Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) categories to baseline and follow-up lung cancer screening studies by using a dedicated CT lung screening viewer with integrated nodule detection and volumetric support with those achieved by using a standard picture archiving and communication system (PACS)-like viewer. Materials and Methods Data were obtained from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). By using data recorded by NLST radiologists, scans were assigned to Lung-RADS categories. For each Lung-RADS category (1 or 2, 3, 4A, and 4B), 40 CT scans (20 baseline scans and 20 follow-up scans) were randomly selected for 160 participants (median age, 61 years; interquartile range, 58-66 years; 61 women) in total. Seven blinded observers independently read all CT scans twice in a randomized order with a 2-week washout period: once by using the standard PACS-like viewer and once by using the dedicated viewer. Observers were asked to assign a Lung-RADS category to each scan and indicate the risk-dominant nodule. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was analyzed by using Fleiss k values and Cohen weighted k values, respectively. Reading times were compared by using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results The interobserver agreement was moderate for the standard viewer and substantial for the dedicated viewer, with Fleiss k values of 0.58 (95\% CI: 0.55, 0.60) and 0.66 (95\% CI: 0.64, 0.68), respectively. The intraobserver agreement was substantial, with a mean Cohen weighted k value of 0.67. The median reading time was significantly reduced from 160 seconds with the standard viewer to 86 seconds with the dedicated viewer (P < .001). Conclusion Lung-RADS interobserver agreement increased from moderate to substantial when using the dedicated CT lung screening viewer. The median reading time was substantially reduced when scans were read by using the dedicated CT lung screening viewer.},

Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a dataset consisting of 300 patient scans was used for model assessment; 150 patient scans were from the competition set and 150 were from an independent dataset. Both test datasets contained 50 patient scans with cancer and 100 without cancer. The reference standard was set by histopathological examination for cancer positive scans and imaging follow-up for at least 2 years for cancer negative scans. The test datasets were applied to the top three performing algorithms from the Data Science Bowl 2017 public competition (called grt123, Julian de Wit \& Daniel Hammack [JWDH] and Aidence). Model outputs were compared with an observer study of 11 radiologists that assessed the same test datasets. Each scan was scored on a continuous scale by both the deep learning algorithms and the radiologists. Performance was measured using multireader multicase receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.877 (95\% CI: 0.842, 0.910) for grt123, 0.902 (95\% CI: 0.871, 0.932) for JWDH, and 0.900 (95\% CI: 0.870, 0.928) for Aidence. The average AUC of the radiologists was 0.917 (95\% CI: 0.889, 0.945), which was significantly higher than grt123 (P = .02); however, no significant difference between the radiologists and JWDH (P = .29) or Aidence (P = .26) was found. Conclusion Deep learning algorithms developed in a public competition reached performance close to radiologists.},

Under existing guidelines for osteoporosis screening, women are included but men are not, and only current smoking is considered.To demonstrate the impact of COPD and smoking history on the risk of osteoporosis and vertebral fracture in men and women.Characteristics of participants with low volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) were identified and related to COPD and other risk factors. We tested associations of sex and COPD with both vBMD and fractures adjusting for age, race, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and glucocorticoid use.vBMD by calibrated quantitative computed tomography (QCT), visually scored vertebral fractures, and severity of lung disease were determined from chest CT scans of 3,321 current and ex-smokers in the COPDGene study. Low vBMD as a surrogate for osteoporosis was calculated from young adult normal values. Male smokers had a small but significantly greater risk of low vBMD (2.5 SD below young adult mean by calibrated QCT) and more fractures than female smokers. Low vBMD was present in 58\% of all subjects, was more frequent in those with worse COPD, and rose to 84\% among subjects with very severe COPD. Vertebral fractures were present in 37\% of all subjects and were associated with lower vBMD at each Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage of severity. Vertebral fractures were most common in the midthoracic region. COPD and especially emphysema were associated with both low vBMD and vertebral fractures after adjustment for steroid use, age, pack-years of smoking, current smoking, and exacerbations. Airway disease was associated with higher bone density after adjustment for other variables. Calibrated QCT identified more subjects with abnormal values than the standard dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in a subset of subjects and correlated well with prevalent fractures.Male smokers, with or without COPD, have a significant risk of low vBMD and vertebral fractures. COPD was associated with low vBMD after adjusting for race, sex, BMI, smoking, steroid use, exacerbations, and age. Screening for low vBMD by using QCT in men and women who are smokers will increase opportunities to identify and treat osteoporosis in this at-risk population.},

METHODS: Before and after a consensus meeting and after developing reference images three observers scored sets of 25 chest radiographs from children with CF. Observer agreement was tested for line, ring, mottled and large soft shadows, for overinflation and for the composite modified Chrispin-Norman score. Correlation with lung function was assessed. RESULTS: Before the consensus meeting agreement between observers 1 and 2 was moderate-good, but with observer 3 agreement was poor-fair. Scores correlated significantly with spirometry for observers 1 and 2 (-0.72<R<-0.42, P?<?0.05), but not for observer 3. Agreement with observer 3 improved after the consensus meeting. Reference images improved agreement for overinflation and mottled and large shadows and correlation with lung function, but agreement for the modified Chrispin-Norman score did not improve further. CONCLUSION: Consensus meetings and reference images improve among-observer agreement for the modified Chrispin-Norman score, but good agreement was not achieved among all observers for the modified Chrispin-Norman score and for bronchial line and ring shadows.},

  title = {Deep Learning for Automatic Contrast Enhancement Phase Detection on Abdominal Computed Tomography},
  abstract = {Purpose: Develop and validate a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic classification of intravenous contrast enhancement (CE) phase on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 2000 abdominal CE-CT scans from our centre, which had information about the CE phase on the DICOM header. In addition to the baseline non-contrast scan (non-CE), three contrast phases were considered at different time intervals after contrast agent administration: the arterial phase (AP) at 40-50 seconds, the portal-venous phase (PVP) at 60-70 seconds and the delayed phase (DP) at 150-240 seconds. The distribution of CE phases on the training/validation dataset was 25.3% non-CE, 25.3% AP, 27.7% PVP and 21.7% DP. Half of the scans were used for model training/validation and a half for independent model testing. A 3-dimensional Inception CNN was trained to perform this multiclass classification task using stratified 4-fold cross-validation for 100 epochs. The model predictions from the 4 folds were ensembled to generate a final likelihood score for each contrast phase in the independent test set. The phase with the highest score was then chosen as the final model output. Results: The overall accuracy for the multiclass CNN was 92.4%, with only 76 out of the 1000 scans in the independent test set being incorrectly classified. The individual accuracies for each phase were 97.6% (244-250) for non-CE, 95.6% (239-50) for AP, 85.6% (214-250) for PVP and 90.8% (227-250) for DP. The most frequent mistake was in differentiating between the portal venous and delayed phases. This can be explained by the reduced amount of contrast agent in the abdomen and the high patient-specific and varied appearance of these two phases within the same protocol. Increasing the size and variety of the training data may improve performance for these two phases. Conclusion: Deep learning can accurately determine intravenous CE phase on multi-phase CE abdominal CT scans. Clinical Relevance Statement: CE information is critical to diagnosis but often lacks from the image metadata. DL can accurately classify CE phases, important for AI automation and the curation of high-quality training datasets.},

  abstract = {Vascular investigations by CT have experienced a decisive advance and found a high acceptance since the introduction of fast volume scanning (spiral CT). We have investigated the underlying physical foundations and optimized the operational aspects of the method now introduced as CT angiography (CTA). Investigations are carried out with a table feed of 1-10 mm/s. Images are reconstructed at 1-2 mm separations by use of algorithms which optimize the layer profile. The parameters must be adapted to the region being investigated. The diagnosis is generally made with interactive cine runs; for this the original images, multiplanar reformations, 3D surface shaded displays (SSD), and maximum intensity projection (MIP) images are used. The 3D representations are discussed in the context of the principle and illustrative examples. Important applications for CTA are the evaluation of aortic aneurysms and dissections, pulmonary vessels, renal arteries, and vessel stents. CTA is characterized by short examination times, low invasiveness, and relatively low cost; in typical cases it is associated with an effective dose of 2-10 mSv. The advantages and disadvantages of the new method are discussed in terms of diagnostic value, image quality, patient dose, contrast medium techniques, and practical aspects in comparison to other angiographic methods.},

Paddle tilt has been recognized as a major problem in volumetric breast density estimation methods. In previous work, we developed a fully automatic method to correct the image for the effect of compression paddle tilt. In this study, we investigated in three experiments the effect of paddle tilt and its correction on volumetric breast density estimation. Results showed that paddle tilt considerably affected accuracy of volumetric breast density estimation, but that effect could be reduced by tilt correction. By applying tilt correction, a significant increase in correspondence between mammographic density estimates and measurements on MRI was established. We argue that in volumetric breast density estimation, tilt correction is both feasible and essential when mammographic images are acquired with a flexible compression paddle.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The association between breast density and breast cancer risk has been established with semi-automated, area based measurement of breast density. In this work we investigate the performance of a fully automated, volumetric method to predict breast cancer risk and the risk of a false positive referral. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The data that was used in this work comprised 50,446 digital screening exams from 33,029 women in the Dutch Breast Cancer Screening Program. The images were recorded on a Hologic Selenia FFDM system, using standard clinical settings. In total 1145 exams were referred for further assessment. 844 exams of these 1145 referrals turned out to be false positives. 301 referrals were biopsy proven malignant breast cancers. For each mammographic image we assessed volumetric breast density with commercially available software (Volpara, Matakina Technology, Wellington, New Zealand). We examined the relationship between volumetric breast density estimates and diagnostic outcome by calculating odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals for percent density converted to the Volpara density grade (VDG), which is a four point scale analog to BI-RADS density scores. We used published data on sensitivity of mammography screening to analyze the potential effect of interval cancers on risk association, as the actual frequency of interval cancers in our dataset in not yet known. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, the odds-ratio for a screen detected breast cancer is 1.53 (0.91-2.68 (95% CI)) comparing highest breast density to low breast density (i.e. VDG 4 vs 1). If we include the estimated contribution of interval tumors, the risk for breast cancer in dense breasts is between 1.49 (1.20-3.04) and 3.58 (2.46-5.31). Breast density decreases the positive predictive value of a referral. The age adjusted odds-ratio for a false positive referral is 2.83 (2.03-4.00) comparing high breast density to low breast density. CONCLUSION: High volumetric breast density, as assessed by a robust, automated method, is associated with both breast cancer and false positive referrals. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: Volumetric breast density estimation may be used for automated selection of women at high risk for breast cancer and false positive referrals, and may hence offer opportunities for tailored screening.},

  booktitle = {ECR},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: The goal of this work is to develop a method to identify women at high risk for having breast cancer that is easily missed in regular mammography screening. Such a method will provide a rationale for selecting women for adjunctive screening. It goes beyond current risk assessment models that are not specifically adapted to reduce the number of interval cancers. METHOD AND MATERIALS: From the Dutch breast cancer screening program we collected 109 cancers that were screen negative and subsequently appeared as interval cancers, and 327 age matched healthy controls. To obtain mammograms without signs of cancerous tissue, we took the contralateral mammograms. We developed a novel machine learning based method called convolutional sparse autoencoder (CSAE) to characterize mammographic texture. The CSAE was trained and tested on raw mammograms to separate interval cancers from controls in a five-fold cross validation. To assess the independency of the texture scores of breast density, density was determined for each image using Volpara. RESULTS: The odds ratios for interval cancer were 1.59 (95%CI: 0.76-3.32), 2.07 (1.02-4.20), and 3.14 (1.60-6.17) for quartile 2, 3 and 4 respectively, relative to quartile 1. Correlation between the texture scores and breast density was 0.59 (0.52-0.64). Breast density adjusted odds ratios, as determined with logistic regression, were 1.49 (0.71-3.13), 1.58 (0.75-3.33), and 1.97 (0.91-4.27). CONCLUSIONS: The CSAE texture score is independently associated with the risk of having a breast cancer that is missed in regular mammography screening. As such it offers opportunities to further enhance personalized breast cancer screening.},

  year = {2015},
  abstract = {PURPOSE The goal of this work is to develop a method to assess the risk of breast cancer masking, based on image characteristics beyond breast density. METHOD AND MATERIALS From the Dutch breast cancer screening program we collected 285 screen detected cancers, and 109 cancers that were screen negative and subsequently appeared as interval cancers. To obtain mammograms without cancerous tissue, we took the contralateral mammograms. We developed a novel machine learning based method called convolutional sparse autoencoder to characterize mammographic texture. The reason for focusing on mammographic texture rather than the amount of breast density is that a developing cancer may not only be masked because it is obscured; it may also be masked because its mammographic signs resemble the texture of normal tissue. The method was trained and tested on raw mammograms to determine cancer detection status in a five-fold cross validation. To assess the interaction of the texture scores with breast density, Volpara Density Grade (VDG) was determined for each image using Volpara, Matakina Technology, New Zealand. RESULTS We grouped women into low (VDG 1/2) versus high (VDG 3/4) dense, and low (Quartile 1/2) versus high (Quartile 3/4) texture risk score. We computed odds ratios (OR) for breast cancer masking risk (i.e. interval versus screen detected cancer) for each of the subgroups. The OR was 1.63 (1.04-2.53 95%CI) for the high dense group (as compared to the low dense group), whereas for the high texture score group (as compared to the low texture score group) this OR was 2.19 (1.37-3.49). Women who were classified as low dense but had a high texture score had a higher masking risk (OR 1.66 (0.53-5.20)) than women with dense breasts but a low texture score. CONCLUSION Mammographic texture is associated with breast cancer masking risk. We were able to identify a subgroup of women who are at an increased risk of having a cancer that is not detected due to textural masking, even though their breasts are non-dense. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Automatic texture analysis enables assessing the risk that a breast cancer is masked in regular mammography, independently of breast density. As such it offers opportunities to further enhance personalized breast cancer screening, beyond breast density.},

The proposed model learns features at multiple scales. To control the models capacity a novel sparsity regularizer is introduced that incorporates both lifetime and population sparsity. We evaluated our method on three different clinical datasets.

  title = {Breast Cancer Risk Prediction with Density Independent Texture Features},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {PURPOSE In personalized breast cancer screening stratification is commonly based on breast density. It has been suggested though, that breast density is a too coarse descriptor for breast cancer risk. Several authors have developed texture features that are potentially more predictive of breast cancer. Yet, in several studies, strong correlation between both types of features is an issue. In this work we investigate a method to generate deep learning texture features that are independent of breast density.
                             METHOD AND MATERIALS From the Dutch breast cancer screening program we collected 394 cancers and 1182 age matched healthy controls. To obtain mammograms without signs of cancerous tissue, we took the contralateral mammograms. For each image breast density was computed using automated software. Texture features were automatically learned from the data by means of techniques that are commonly used in deep learning. In the initial matching, breast density was on average higher in the cases than in the controls, as breast density is associated with breast cancer risk. Texture features and scores learned on this set (Td) are determined to be correlated to density. In order to obtain density independent features and scores (Ti) we balanced breast density over the cases and the controls by performing a rematching based on breast density. Non-matching cases and controls were excluded during training; in the testing phase all images were scored. We trained and tested Td and Ti to separate between cancers and controls with 5-fold cross-validation. We compared the performance of Td and Ti in terms of predictive power.
                             RESULTS Spearman's rank correlation between density and Td was 0.81 (0.79-0.83). The density adjusted odds ratios for breast cancer were 1.15 (0.81-1.65), 1.40 (0.98-2.00), and 1.39 (0.92-2.09) for quartile 2-4 respectively, relative to quartile 1. For Ti the correlation with density was 0.00 (-0.06 - 0.05). The odds ratios were 1.15 (0.82-1.62), 1.33 (0.96-1.86), and 1.45 (1.05-2.01). The AUC for separating cancers from controls was 0.539 (0.506-0.572).
                             CONCLUSION We developed a method for generating density independent texture features and scores. The obtained texture scores were significantly associated with breast cancer risk.
                             CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION The obtained density independent texture features may enhance breast cancer risk models beyond breast density, and as such offer opportunities to further optimize personalized breast cancer screening.},

  title = {Discovery of Mammogram Regions That Show Early Changes Due to the Development of Breast Cancer: A Preliminary Work},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {Background: Recent studies have indicated that not just density but also texture in mammograms is associated with risk. Since ninety percent of breast cancers arise from the ductal and lobular glands also calcification appears as a parallel lines assocoiated with blood vessel hence we choose to investigate texture features describing the local orientation of breast tissue in an anatomically oriented breast coordinate system that is more accurate than traditional image coordinate system. We further discover the region on mammogram where changes due to breast cancer are most like to occur and are not visible by a naked eye to a radiologist in a case-control study design. Evaluation: We use a machine learning system consisting of (1) the Gaussian derivative features on four scales extracted with respect to (2) an anatomically oriented breast coordinate system; (3) Sequential Forward Selection of features, and (4) committee of kNN classifiers. The use of the anatomical breast coordinate system defines matching locations across mammograms and makes it possible to investigate what are the mammogram regions that show significantly different classification scores between the cancer and control group. We use independent training and testing sets from the case-control study of 495 women including 245 diagnosed with breast cancer 2-4 years after the baseline mammograms, used in this work. Discussion: Our experiments suggest that significant regions for breast cancer risk assessment are the glandular tissue region behind the nipple as well as the lobule close to the pectorial muscle in the breast, which both can be anatomically justified. Moreover, this work suggests which regions should be more carefully considered to improve both preclinical and follow-up screening phases of cancer progression. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the benefits of including breast coordinate over traditional coordinate system considering the anatomy of the breast in mammogram. It also suggests which regions should be more carefully considered to improve both preclinical and follow-up screening phases of cancer progression. However, larger study population is warrented to validate this hypothesis.},

  abstract = {It is well understood nowadays that changes in the mammographic parenchymal pattern are an indicator of a risk of breast cancer and we have developed a statistical method that estimates the mammogram regions where the parenchymal changes, due to breast cancer, occur. This region of interest is computed from a score map by utilising the anatomical breast coordinate system developed in our previous work. The method also makes an automatic scale selection to avoid overfitting while the region estimates are computed by a nested cross-validation scheme. In this way, it is possible to recover those mammogram regions that show a significant difference in classification scores between the cancer and the control group. Our experiments suggested that the most significant mammogram region is the region behind the nipple and that can be justified by previous findings from other research groups. This result was conducted on the basis of the cross-validation experiments on independent training, validation and testing sets from the case-control study of 490 women, of which 245 women were diagnosed with breast cancer within a period of 2-4 years after the baseline mammograms. We additionally generalised the estimated region to another, mini-MIAS study and showed that the transferred region estimate gives at least a similar classification result when compared to the case where the whole breast region is used. In all, by following our method, one most likely improves both preclinical and follow-up breast cancer screening, but a larger study population will be required to test this hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Image processing is a crucial element of modern digital mammography. Optimizing mammogram presentation may lead to more efficient reading and improved diagnostic performance. Despite that the effects of image processing are often much larger than those of acquisition parameter settings, little is known about how image processing can be optimized. Experts agree that comparison of features in various mammographic views is very important. This issue must be addressed by processing. Variation of image presentation across views and subsequent mammograms should be minimized. The dynamic range of electronic displays is limited. Therefore, processing techniques should be designed to limit the dynamic range of mammograms. This can effectively be done by applying peripheral enhancement in the uncompressed tissue region near the projected skin?air interface. Adaptive contrast enhancement can be applied to enhance micro-calcifications and dense tissue in the interior of the mammogram. Mammogram processing should be aimed at displaying all relevant information in good contrast simultaneously, as human interaction to manipulate contrast during reading is too time-consuming to be applied on a regular basis.},

  title = {A Novel System for Computer-aided Lesion Classification in Automated 3D Breast Ultrasound},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To present a method for computer aided classification of lesions in Automated 3D Breast Ultrasound (ABUS) and to determine how well it performs in comparison to radiologists. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A method for characterizing lesions in ABUS was developed. Lesions are automatically segmented when a seed point is provided, using dynamic programming in combination with a spiral scanning technique. This method produces reliable lesion boundaries in the presence of shadowing and speckle. Subsequently, features representing spiculation, lesion shape, margin contrast, posterior enhancement, texture, and echogenicity are computed. Spiculation is computed in the coronal planes, other features are calculated in 3D. Linear Discriminant Analysis is used to determine a malignancy rating for each lesion. To train the system we used leave-one-out. Images for training and testing were obtained from three institutes using the Somo*V system (U-systems, Sunnyvale, CA). Images of 88 patients were used for evaluation. Each image had one lesion, 41 were benign and 47 were cancers. Six readers (4 radiologists and 2 residents) read the series of cases on a dedicated workstation and rated each lesion on a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 100. Performance of the readers was compared with CAD standalone using ROC analysis (DBM MRMC 2.2). RESULTS: Spiculation and margin contrast were the most discriminative features. With an AUC value of 0.917 the CAD system performed as good as the best reader (0.918). The average AUC of the radiologists was 0.881. The residents obtained an AUC of 0.818. The difference between CAD and the readers was not significant (p=0.11) CONCLUSION: A novel method for characterizing lesions in ABUS was developed which performs as well as a good radiologist. Coronal spiculation, which is not visible in traditional handheld ultrasound, appeared to be an effective feature. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: A CAD system for classification of lesions in automated 3D ultrasound can be used as a second reader in screening and clinical practice, and may reduce false positive recalls or and/or biopsies.},

  title = {Concurrent Interactive Use of {CAD} for Detection of Masses in Mammograms},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare effectiveness of a novel interactive CAD system for detecting masses in screening mammograms to the current practice of using prompts. METHOD AND MATERIALS: We investigated a novel method of presenting CAD results to radiologists. Instead of displaying prompts after unaided inspection, information is provided on request when a suspicious region is probed using a pointer. The method is aimed at helping readers to make decisions rather than to avoid perception errors. Using an intelligent algorithm the CAD system we developed also correlates MLO and CC views, and displays corresponding CAD results in both views when only one view is probed. Suspiciousness ratings computed by CAD are displayed when regions are probed, otherwise this information remains hidden. In an observer study we compared effectiveness of this interactive system to traditional prompting. Five certified mammographers and three residents participated in the study. After a short training phase, an enriched series of 200 FFDM screening cases with priors was read two times, once with interactive CAD and once with CAD prompts. In the session with CAD prompts findings were recorded before and after activating CAD, to allow assessment of unaided performance. The study series included 63 screen detected cancers, 17 missed cancers that were retrospectively visible, 20 false positives, and 100 normals. Microcalcification cases were excluded. Readers reported localized findings with malignancy ratings scored on a continuous scale. Correct cancer localization fraction was computed per reader as a function of the false positive fraction. RESULTS: Readers prefered the novel CAD system. Because they were not distracted by irrelevant false positive CAD prompts they had more confidence in the computer aid. A significant improvement in detection performance was obtained with interactive CAD (p < 0.012) while CAD prompts had no effect on detection performance. Mean sensitivity in an interval of negative recalls less than 15% was 49.8% when reading without CAD, 49.7% with CAD prompting, and 57.7% with interactive use of CAD. CONCLUSION: Detection performance for mammographic masses increased significantly with concurrent interactive use of CAD. while presenting CAD prompts had no effect. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: Mammography CAD for masses may become more effective when it is used for decision making. This may lead to earlier detection of invasive cancers.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: A CAD system was developed to assist radiologists in characterizing lesions in Automated 3D Breast Ultrasound (ABUS). In this study we investigate if reader performance improves with CAD. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The CAD system computes a lesion malignancy rating when a seed point is placed in the center of the lesion. In this computation features representing spiculation, lesion shape, margin contrast, posterior enhancement, texture, and echogenicity are calculated from a 3D lesion segmentation and combined in a mathematical model using a training database and leave-one-out. Margin contrast and coronal spiculation were the most discriminating features. Images used in this study were obtained from three institutes using the Somo-V system (U-systems, Sunnyvale, CA). 88 patients were included and for each patient one ABUS view with a lesion was selected. 47 lesions were malignant and 41 were benign. Six readers (4 radiologists and 2 residents) read the series of cases two times on a dedicated workstation (HAMAM prototype, Mevis Medical Solutions, Bremen), allowing synchronized viewing of coronal, transversal, and sagittal slices. Readers rated the indicated lesions on a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 100. Readers first read half of the cases with CAD and the other half without. In the second session cases were read with/without CAD if they were first read without/with. Bef ore the study sessions, readers were presented a series of 26 training cases with 23 benign and 14 malignant lesions, to familiarize them with the 3D viewing station and CAD ratings. To compare performance with and without CAD ROC analysis was used (DBM MRMC 2.2). RESULTS: With an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.917 CAD performed very well in comparison to the readers. Without CAD the average AUC of the readers was 0.860 (0.881 for the radiologists, 0.818 for the residents). With CAD the perf ormance of the readers increased to 0.881 (0.886 for the radiologists, 0.869 for the residents). The difference was not significant (p=0.21). CONCLUSION: A CAD system for lesion characterization in ABUS perorms well in comparison to readers. Reader performance did not increase significantly when working with CAD, which may be due to inexperience with ABUS and CAD.},

  title = {High Breast Compression in Mammography May Reduce Sensitivity},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {PURPOSE While firm breast compression is generally thought to be required for high quality mammograms the relationship between the amount of compression and screening performance has not been studied systematically. The aim of this study is to determine breast cancer screening outcomes in relation to the compression pressure applied during mammography.
                             METHOD AND MATERIALS A consecutive series of 111,870 digital screening examinations performed in 53,684 women between July 2003 and December 2011 was collected from a screening centre operating within a nationwide breast cancer screening program. A total of 662 screen-detected cancers were included in this series, while 280 interval cancers corresponding to the selected exams were identified by linkage to the Dutch Cancer Registry. Using a research version of Volpara Density software (Volpara Solutions, Wellington, NZ) breast volume (V), dense tissue volume (VD), and volumetric density grade (VDG), were estimated for each exam, while compression pressure was estimated for medio-lateral oblique (MLO) view by dividing the compression force by the area of contact surface between the breast and the compression paddle. We calculated frequencies of recalls, screen-detected cancers, and interval cancers stratified by compression pressure in five groups and derived program sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV). In addition, for each group we computed mean values of V, VD, and VDG. For statistical analysis Pearson's Chi-squared test was used.
                             RESULTS Screening outcomes were different in the five compression pressure groups (p=0.004). Program sensitivity decreased with increasing pressure (77.0%, 69.7%, 74.5%, 63.2%, 66.7%) (p=0.02), specificity was similar, and PPV was highest in the midrange of pressure (28.5%, 31.0%, 34.2%, 26.7%, 25.7%) (p=0.03). Cutoff points for pressure dividing the data in groups of 20% were 7.7, 9.2, 10.7, 12.8 kPa. V and VD both decreased with increasing pressure. Mean VDG moderately increased (1.75, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.8).
                             CONCLUSION Results suggest that if too much pressure is applied during mammography this may increase interval cancer rates and decrease PPV.
                             CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Controlling pressure during mammography is important to decrease the discomfort experienced by women, but it may also be required to optimize screening outcomes.},

  abstract = {It is widely expected that in the near future the use of photographic film in diagnostic medicine will be replaced by digital pictorial information systems. In this respect progress in the development of Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) and medical workstations is frequently discussed. Until now, the main research effort has been focused on image acquisition, archiving and display. Without doubt, however, the use of medical workstations for viewing will also stimulate interest in the use of image analysis techniques as a diagnostic tool. As it is commonly recognized that human vision is inadequate for making accurate measurements in images, supplementary use of fast and reproducible computer analysis may be advantageous. For instance, local statistical variables which are hard to perceive may contain valuable information. On the other hand it seems unlikely that in the near future automated analysis will outperform the human eye in more complex vision tasks},

  abstract = {A statistically based segmentation method was applied to the recognition of organs in abdominal CT scans. To incorporate prior knowledge of anatomical structure, a stochastic model was used that represented abdominal geometry in three dimensions. Properties of each tissue class with respect to X-ray imaging were modeled by mean grey-value distributions. Twelve different tissues were labeled simultaneously. Deterministic maximization of the a posteriori distribution as well as stochastic optimization by simulated annealing were both applied. Mean segmentation results were determined for a set of 18 scan sequences, using a set of reference contours designated by a radiologist as ground truth. Results appeared to be somewhat better using simulated annealing. The proposed segmentation method, which is fast and fully automatic, seems sufficiently accurate for many clinical applications, such as determination of relative organ volumes.},

  abstract = {A 12 bit CCD camera equipped with a linear sensor of 4096 photodiodes is used to digitize conventional mammographic films. An iso-precision conversion of the pixel values is performed to transform the image data to a scale on which the image noise is equal at each level. For this purpose film noise and digitization noise have been determined as a function of optical density and pixel size. It appears that only at high optical densities digitization noise is comparable to or larger than film noise. The quantization error caused by compression of images recorded with 12 bits per pixel to 8 bit images by an iso-precision conversion has been calculated as a function of the number of quantization levels. For mammograms digitized in a 40962 matrix the additional error caused by such a scale transform is only about 1.5 percent. An iso-precision scale transform can be advantageous when automated procedures for quantitative image analysis are developed. Especially when detection of signals in noise is aimed at, a constant noise level over the whole pixel value range is very convenient. This is demonstrated by applying local thresholding to detect small microcalcifications. Results are compared to those obtained by using logarithmic or linearized scales.},

Despite this, the high grading variability among pathologists leads to the potential for under- and overtreatment. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have shown promise in assisting pathologists to perform Gleason grading, which could help address this problem. In this mini-review, we highlight studies reporting on the development of AI systems for cancer detection and Gleason grading, and discuss the progress needed for widespread clinical implementation, as well as anticipated future developments. PATIENT SUMMARY: This mini-review summarizes the evidence relating to the validation of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted cancer detection and Gleason grading of prostate cancer in biopsies, and highlights the remaining steps required prior to its widespread clinical implementation. We found that, although there is strong evidence to show that AI is able to perform Gleason grading on par with experienced uropathologists, more work is needed to ensure the accuracy of results from AI systems in diverse settings across different patient populations, digitization platforms, and pathology laboratories.},

                             Key Points

                             * Pulmonologists and radiologists both have key roles in the set up of multidisciplinary LCS teams with experts from many other fields.

                             * Pulmonologists identify people eligible for LCS, reach out to family doctors, share the decision-making process and promote tobacco cessation.

                             * Radiologists ensure appropriate image quality, minimum dose and a standardised reading/reporting algorithm, together with a clear definition of a "positive screen".

                             * Strict algorithms define the exact management of screen-detected nodules and incidental findings.

                             * For LCS to be (cost-)effective, it has to target a population defined by risk prediction models.},

  abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their extensions have carved open many exciting ways to tackle well known and challenging medical image analysis problems such as medical image denoising, reconstruction, segmentation, data simulation, detection or classification. Furthermore, their ability to synthesize images at unprecedented levels of realism also gives hope that the chronic scarcity of labeled data in the medical field can be resolved with the help of these generative models. In this review paper, a broad overview of recent literature on GANs for medical applications is given, the shortcomings and opportunities of the proposed methods are thoroughly discussed and potential future work is elaborated. A total of 63 papers published until end of July 2018 are reviewed. For quick access, the papers and important details such as the underlying method, datasets and performance are summarized in tables.},

  booktitle = {45th World Conference on Lung Health},

  abstract = {Background: There is renewed interest in chest radiography (CXR) as a screening tool for tuberculosis in high burden countries. Limited availability of skilled personnel in low-resource settings is a major barrier to its wider-scale adoption. Computer-aided detection (CAD) has been shown to be effective in supporting TB diagnostic algorithms in African settings; however, limited real-world applications of such systems have been evaluated. This study compares automated readings of a CAD system for CXR abnormalities with the interpretations of radiologists and a clinical officer. Design/Methods: Suspects for lung diseases were identified through active screening in the private sector at Family-Practitioner clinics. These suspects were referred to the lung health diagnosis and screening center for CXR from three low-income towns of Karachi,Pakistan. CXRs were analyzed using CAD4TB v3.07(Diagnostic Image Analysis Group,Nijmegen,The Netherlands), a system designed for TB diagnosis that computes an abnormality score (0-100) on the basis of shape, symmetry and texture of the lung fields. CXRs were reviewed by two radiologists and a clinical officer who were masked to the CAD4TB score and patient disease status. Interobserver Agreement (Cohen's Kappa) between CAD4TB and each radiologist and clinical officer for CXR abnormality was analyzed at various cut-points of CAD4TB. Results: CXRs from 186 suspects were included in the study for analysis. A CAD4TB score of 80 maximized agreement between CAD4TB and each reviewer (Radiologist 1: Kappa 0.62, Radiologist 2: 0.54, Clinical Officer: 0.60). Mean sensitivity and specificity for CXR abnormality of CAD4TB compared to the reviewers was 78% and 79% respectively. A high proportion of non-TB CXR abnormalities as reported by the reviewers were also classified as abnormal by CAD4TB at a cut-point of 80 (Radiologist 1:88.2%, Radiologist 2: 71.9%, Clinical Officer 60%). Agreement between CAD4TB and each reviewer subsequently increased after including only TB CXR abnormalities (Radiologist 1: Kappa 0.63, RadiolA,A!ogist 2: 0.67, Clinical Officer: 0.71). Conclusion: CAD4TB has the potential as a screening tool for TB in high burden countries. Detection of non-TB abnormalities by CAD4TB may lead to challenges in interpretation of results in programmatic settings. Use of additional data relevant to local disease epidemiology such as patient demographics as well as symptom screening may improve accuracy of CAD4TB when utilized in TB control programs.},

  abstract = {A method is presented for automatically segmenting the cerebral hemi-spheres in non-contrast CT images. The method consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that fuses U-Net and DenseNet paradigms into one ar-chitecture. Eight full patient scans were used for training the network. Rotation, shifting and mirroring were used as augmentation steps to enrich the training data set. The method was evaluated on a clinical dataset of 169 patients that received a non-contrast CT. This is a dataset with anatomical and pathologi-cal differences that represents the population of patients that are seen in daily practice. For every patient, three arbitrary orthogonal slices were selected and manually annotated, resulting in 507 reference slices. The method produced few erroneous segmentations and an achieved overall Dice coefficient of 0.944 +- 0.086. The method has proven to be accurate and robust for the segmentation of left and right hemispheres even in the presence of pathology and imaging artifacts.},

  abstract = {Background: In patients with heterogeneous emphysema, surgical and bronchoscopic lung volume reduction ({LVR}) treatments are available. However, for patients with homogeneous emphysema these treatments are hardly investigated and seem less effective. Bronchoscopic {LVR} coil treatment has been shown to be effective in patients with heterogeneous emphysema, but this treatment has not been exclusively investigated in homogeneous emphysema. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of {LVR} coil treatment in patients with homogeneous emphysema. Methods: In this single-arm, open-label study, patients received a maximum of 12 {LVR} coils (PneumRx Inc., Mountain View, Calif., {USA}) in each upper lobe in two sequential procedures. Tests were performed at baseline and at 6 months. The primary endpoint was the improvement from baseline in 6-min walking distance (6{MWD}) after treatment. Results: Ten patients with severe airway obstruction and hyperinflation were treated. A median of 11 (range 10-12) coils were placed in each lung. Two chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and one small pneumothorax were recorded as serious adverse events. At 6 months, 6{MWD} had improved from 289 to 350 m (p = 0.005); forced vital capacity from 2.17 to 2.55 liters (p = 0.047); residual volume from 5.04 to 4.44 liters (p = 0.007) and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire from 63 to 48 points (p = 0.028). Conclusion: {LVR} coil treatment in homogeneous patients improves hyperinflation, airway resistance, exercise capacity and quality of life with an acceptable safety profile. The benefit of {LVR} coil treatment is not limited to patients with heterogeneous emphysema, and patients with homogenous emphysema can benefit as well.},

  abstract = {Bronchoscopic lung-volume reduction with the use of one-way endobronchial valves is a potential treatment for patients with severe emphysema. To date, the benefits have been modest but have been hypothesized to be much larger in patients without interlobar collateral ventilation than in those with collateral ventilation.We randomly assigned patients with severe emphysema and a confirmed absence of collateral ventilation to bronchoscopic endobronchial-valve treatment (EBV group) or to continued standard medical care (control group). Primary outcomes were changes from baseline to 6 months in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and 6-minute walk distance.Eighty-four patients were recruited, of whom 16 were excluded because they had collateral ventilation (13 patients) or because lobar segments were inaccessible to the endobronchial valves (3 patients). The remaining 68 patients (mean [A,A+-SD] age, 59A,A+-9 years; 46 were women) were randomly assigned to the EBV group (34 patients) or the control group (34). At baseline, the FEV1 and FVC were 29A,A+-7\% and 77A,A+-18\% of the predicted values, respectively, and the 6-minute walk distance was 374A,A+-86 m. Intention-to-treat analyses showed significantly greater improvements in the EBV group than in the control group from baseline to 6 months: the increase in FEV1 was greater in the EBV group than in the control group by 140 ml (95\% confidence interval [CI], 55 to 225), the increase in FVC was greater by 347 ml (95\% CI, 107 to 588), and the increase in the 6-minute walk distance was greater by 74 m (95\% CI, 47 to 100) (P<0.01 for all comparisons). By 6 months, 23 serious adverse events had been reported in the EBV group, as compared with 5 in the control group (P<0.001). One patient in the EBV group died. Serious treatment-related adverse events in this group included pneumothorax (18\% of patients) and events requiring valve replacement (12\%) or removal (15\%).Endobronchial-valve treatment significantly improved pulmonary function and exercise capacity in patients with severe emphysema characterized by an absence of interlobar collateral ventilation.

  abstract = {Since the introduction of deep learning, a new era in radiology has started: the transformation of Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) tools that approaches radiologist level performance. Compared to traditional CAD, modern deep-learning CAD is applied to various problems in radiology. Less is known about where to implement such tools in the clinical workflow and how this impacts the workflow of radiologists. As an example use case, we evaluated three (two commercial) CAD systems for pulmonary nodule detection on chest radiographs. We considered three broad strategies: CAD as first reader, CAD as second reader, and CAD concurrently with readers. Even though standalone CAD performs worse than readers, a performance increase of 10% sensitivity or 7% increase in specificity can be achieved depending on the implementation scenario. During CAD as second reader, the possibility of a reader to score an image as 'uncertain' allowed an increase in sensitivity from 69% to 72% using CAD with no further drawbacks. For most other scenarios, the trade-off between specificity - sensitivity versus reading time was observed. Apart from measuring performance, change in workflow and risk were also considered as metrics to capture qualitative results. By comparing scenarios against these metrics, we show the effects of various implementation strategies for CAD on one dataset.},

Fifty-four patients with biopsy-proved prostate cancer underwent clinical MR spectroscopic imaging followed by prostatectomy. Guided by the histopathologic map, all spectroscopy voxels that contained tumor tissue were selected, and metabolite ratios (choline [Cho] plus creatine [Cr]-to-citrate [Cit] and Cho/Cr ratios) were derived. For each spectroscopic voxel, 25th percentile apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the region corresponding to that voxel was determined, representing the most aberrant tumor part on the ADC map, which was often smaller than spectroscopic imaging voxels. Maximum metabolic ratios and minimum 25th percentile ADC of each tumor were related to tumor aggressiveness and were used to differentiate aggressiveness classes. A logistic regression model (LRM) was used to combine data from both modalities.Results:Significant correlation was found between aggressiveness classes and maximum Cho+Cr/Cit ratio (? = 0.36), maximum Cho/Cr ratio (? = 0.35), and minimum 25th percentile ADC (? = -0.63) in the peripheral zone (PZ). In the transition zone (TZ), the correlation was significant for only Cho+Cr/Cit and Cho/Cr ratios (? = 0.58 and ? = 0.60, respectively). For differentiation between aggressiveness classes, LRM use did not result in significantly improved differentiation over any individual variables.Conclusion:These findings enabled confirmation that MR spectroscopic imaging and DW imaging offer potential for in vivo noninvasive assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness, and both modalities have comparable performance. The combination did not result in better performance. Nonetheless, the better performances of metabolite ratios in the TZ and of ADCs in the PZ suggest that they have complementary value.A-A?A 1/2  RSNA, 2012.},

Fifty-seven prostate cancer patients underwent an MR examination followed by prostatectomy. One hematoxylin and eosin-stained section of the resected prostate per patient was digitized and computationally segmented into nuclei, lumen, and combination of epithelial cytoplasm and stroma.

ADC and two metabolite ratios (citrate [Cit], spermine [Spm], and creatine [Cr] to choline [Cho] and Cho to Cr plus Spm) were correlated with percentage areas of nuclei, lumen, and cytoplasm and stroma for peripheral zone (PZ), transition zone (TZ), and tumor tissue in both zones of the prostate by using a linear mixed-effect model and Spearman correlation coefficient (?).ADC and (Cit + Spm + Cr)/Cho ratio showed positive correlation with percentage area of lumen (? = 0.43 and 0.50, respectively) and negative correlation with percentage area of nuclei (? = -0.29 and -0.26, respectively). The Cho/(Cr + Spm) ratio showed negative association with percentage area of lumen (? = -0.40) and positive association with area of nuclei (? = 0.26).

The authors' aim is to develop a versatile, fast, and reliable interactive system to segment anatomical structures. In this study, this system was used for segmenting lungs in challenging thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans.In volumetric thoracic CT scans, the chest is segmented and divided into 3D volumes of interest (VOIs), containing voxels with similar densities. These VOIs are automatically labeled as either lung tissue or nonlung tissue. The automatic labeling results can be corrected using an interactive or a supervised interactive approach. When using the supervised interactive system, the user is shown the classification results per slice, whereupon he/she can adjust incorrect labels. The system is retrained continuously, taking the corrections and approvals of the user into account. In this way, the system learns to make a better distinction between lung tissue and nonlung tissue. When using the interactive framework without supervised learning, the user corrects all incorrectly labeled VOIs manually. Both interactive segmentation tools were tested on 32 volumetric CT scans of pigs, mice and humans, containing pulmonary abnormalities.On average, supervised interactive lung segmentation took under 9 min of user interaction. Algorithm computing time was 2 min on average, but can easily be reduced. On average, 2.0\% of all VOIs in a scan had to be relabeled. Lung segmentation using the interactive segmentation method took on average 13 min and involved relabeling 3.0\% of all VOIs on average. The resulting segmentations correspond well to manual delineations of eight axial slices per scan, with an average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.933.The authors have developed two fast and reliable methods for interactive lung segmentation in challenging chest CT images. Both systems do not require prior knowledge of the scans under consideration and work on a variety of scans.},

  abstract = {The textural patterns in the lung parenchyma, as visible on computed tomography (CT) scans, are essential to make a correct diagnosis in interstitial lung disease. We developed one automatic and two interactive protocols for classification of normal and seven types of abnormal lung textures. Lungs were segmented and subdivided into volumes of interest (VOIs) with homogeneous texture using a clustering approach. In the automatic protocol, VOIs were classified automatically by an extra-trees classifier that was trained using annotations of VOIs from other CT scans. In the interactive protocols, an observer iteratively trained an extra-trees classifier to distinguish the different textures, by correcting mistakes the classifier makes in a slice-by-slice manner. The difference between the two interactive methods was whether or not training data from previously annotated scans was used in classification of the first slice. The protocols were compared in terms of the percentages of VOIs that observers needed to relabel. Validation experiments were carried out using software that simulated observer behavior. In the automatic classification protocol, observers needed to relabel on average 58\% of the VOIs. During interactive annotation without the use of previous training data, the average percentage of relabeled VOIs decreased from 64\% for the first slice to 13\% for the second half of the scan. Overall, 21\% of the VOIs were relabeled. When previous training data was available, the average overall percentage of VOIs requiring relabeling was 20\%, decreasing from 56\% in the first slice to 13\% in the second half of the scan.},

  abstract = {For computerized analysis of textures in interstitial lung disease, manual annotations of lung tissue are necessary. Since making these annotations is labor intensive, we previously proposed an interactive annotation framework. In this framework, observers iteratively trained a classifier to distinguish the different texture types by correcting its classification errors. In this work, we investigated three ways to extend this approach, in order to decrease the amount of user interaction required to annotate all lung tissue in a computed tomography scan. First, we conducted automatic classification experiments to test how data from previously annotated scans can be used for classification of the scan under consideration. We compared the performance of a classifier trained on data from one observer, a classifier trained on data from multiple observers, a classifier trained on consensus training data, and an ensemble of classifiers, each trained on data from different sources. Experiments were conducted without and with texture selection (ts). In the former case, training data from all eight textures was used. In the latter, only training data from the texture types present in the scan were used, and the observer would have to indicate textures contained in the scan to be analyzed. Second, we simulated interactive annotation to test the effects of (1) asking observers to perform ts before the start of annotation, (2) the use of a classifier trained on data from previously annotated scans at the start of annotation, when the interactive classifier is untrained, and (3) allowing observers to choose which interactive or automatic classification results they wanted to correct. Finally, various strategies for selecting the classification results that were presented to the observer were considered. Classification accuracies for all possible interactive annotation scenarios were compared. Using the best-performing protocol, in which observers select the textures that should be distinguished in the scan and in which they can choose which classification results to use for correction, a median accuracy of 88% was reached. The results obtained using this protocol were significantly better than results obtained with other interactive or automatic classification protocols.},

We evaluated the performance of computer-aided detection for tuberculosis (CAD4TB) in people living with diabetes mellitus (PLWD) in Indonesia. PLWD underwent symptom screening and chest X-ray (CXR); sputum was examined in those with positive symptoms and/or CXR. Digital CXRs were scored using CAD4TB and analysed retrospectively using clinical and microbiological diagnosis as a reference. The area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of CAD4TB scores was determined, and an optimal threshold score established. Agreement between CAD4TB and the radiologist's reading was determined. Among 346 included PLWD, seven (2.0%) had microbiologically confirmed and two (0.6%) had clinically diagnosed TB. The highest agreement of CAD4TB with radiologist reading was achieved using a threshold score of 70 (k = 0.41, P < 0.001). The AUC for CAD4TB was 0.89 (95%CI 0.73-1.00). A threshold score of 65 for CAD4TB resulted in a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of respectively 88.9% (95%CI 51.8-99.7), 88.5% (95%CI 84.6-91.7), 17.0% (95%CI 7.6-30.8) and 99.6% (95%CI 98.2-100). With this threshold, 48 (13.9%) individuals needed microbiological examination and no microbiologically confirmed cases were missed. CAD4TB has potential as a triage tool for TB screening in PLWD, thereby significantly reducing the need for microbiological examination.},

A deep convolutional neural network is trained on the CAMELYON16 challenge as a source model. This network is finetuned to detect metastases in colon or head-neck regions using minimal resources and trying to prevent from catastrophic forgetting. We demonstrate that transfer learning can learn a related task with a small amount of training data and that it can even be used to increase performance on the source task. Parameter values as the learning rate and dataset size are highly task-specific. Elastic Weight Consolidation can be used to prevent from catastrophic forgetting at a minimal cost. All this enables learning a task with less training time and resources.},

A total of 13,195 men (primary analysis) and 2594 women (subgroup analyses) between the ages of 50 and 74 were randomly assigned to undergo CT screening at T0 (baseline), year 1, year 3, and year 5.5 or no screening. We obtained data on cancer diagnosis and the date and cause of death through linkages with national registries in the Netherlands and Belgium, and a review committee confirmed lung cancer as the cause of death when possible. A minimum follow-up of 10 years until December 31, 2015, was completed for all participants. Among men, the average adherence to CT screening was 90.0%. On average, 9.2% of the screened participants underwent at least one additional CT scan (initially indeterminate). The overall referral rate for suspicious nodules was 2.1%. At 10 years of follow-up, the incidence of lung cancer was 5.58 cases per 1000 person-years in the screening group and 4.91 cases per 1000 person-years in the control group; lung-cancer mortality was 2.50 deaths per 1000 person-years and 3.30 deaths per 1000 person-years, respectively. The cumulative rate ratio for death from lung cancer at 10 years was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 0.94; P = 0.01) in the screening group as compared with the control group, similar to the values at years 8 and 9. Among women, the rate ratio was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.38 to 1.14) at 10 years of follow-up, with values of 0.41 to 0.52 in years 7 through 9. In this trial involving high-risk persons, lung-cancer mortality was significantly lower among those who underwent volume CT screening than among those who underwent no screening. There were low rates of follow-up procedures for results suggestive of lung cancer.

We subsequently investigate to what extent features such as location and patient information and commonly used manual features can still complement the network and see improvements at high specificity over the CNN especially with location and context features, which contain information not available to the CNN. Additionally, a reader study was performed, where the network was compared to certified screening radiologists on a patch level and we found no significant difference between the network and the readers.},

Since many natural scenes and medical images vary in size and are too large to feed to the networks as a whole, two stage systems are typically employed, where in the first stage, small regions of interest in the image are located and presented to the network as training and test data. These systems allow us to harness accurate region based annotations, making the problem easier to learn. However, information is processed purely locally and context is not taken into account. In this paper, we present preliminary work on the employment of a Conditional Random Field (CRF) that is trained on top the CNN to model contextual interactions such as the presence of other suspicious regions, for mammography CAD. The model can easily be extended to incorporate other sources of information, such as symmetry, temporal change and various patient covariates and is general in the sense that it can have application in other CAD problems.},

  abstract = {It is estimated that 7% of women in the western world will develop palpable breast cysts in their lifetime. Even though cysts have been correlated with risk of developing breast cancer, many of them are benign and do not require follow-up. We develop a method to discriminate benign solitary cysts from malignant masses in digital mammography. We think a system like this can have merit in the clinic as a decision aid or complementary to specialized modalities. We employ a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify cyst and mass patches. Deep CNNs have been shown to be powerful classifiers, but need a large amount of training data for which medical problems are often difficult to come by. The key contribution of this paper is that we show good performance can be obtained on a small dataset by pretraining the network on a large dataset of a related task. We subsequently investigate the following: (a) when a mammographic exam is performed, two different views of the same breast are recorded. We investigate the merit of combining the output of the classifier from these two views. (b) We evaluate the importance of the resolution of the patches fed to the network. (c) A method dubbed tissue augmentation is subsequently employed, where we extract normal tissue from normal patches and superimpose this onto the actual samples aiming for a classifier invariant to occluding tissue. (d) We combine the representation extracted using the deep CNN with our previously developed features. We show that using the proposed deep learning method, an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.80 can be obtained on a set of benign solitary cysts and malignant mass findings recalled in screening. We find that it works significantly better than our previously developed approach by comparing the AUC of the ROC using bootstrapping. By combining views, the results can be further improved, though this difference was not found to be significant. We find no significant difference between using a resolution of 100 versus 200 micron. The proposed tissue augmentations give a small improvement in performance, but this improvement was also not found to be significant. The final system obtained an AUC of 0.80 with 95% confidence interval [0.78, 0.83], calculated using bootstrapping. The system works best for lesions larger than 27 mm where it obtains an AUC value of 0.87. We have presented a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) method to discriminate cysts from solid lesion in mammography using features from a deep CNN trained on a large set of mass candidates, obtaining an AUC of 0.80 on a set of diagnostic exams recalled from screening. We believe the system shows great potential and comes close to the performance of recently developed spectral mammography. We think the system can be further improved when more data and computational power becomes available.},

  abstract = {Neural networks, in particular deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have recently gone through a renaissance sparked by the introduction of more efficient training procedures and massive amounts of raw annotated data. Barring a handful of modalities, medical images are typically too large to present as input as a whole and models are consequently trained with subsets of images or cases, representing the most crucial bits of information. When inspecting a scene to identify objects, humans take cues from not just the article in question but also the elements in its vicinity: a frisbee is more likely to be a plate in the presence of a fork and knife. Similar principles apply to the analysis of medical images: specialists base their judgment of an abnormality on all available data, harnessing information such as symmetrical differences in or between organs in question and temporal change, if multiple recordings are available. \\

                              In this paper we investigate the addition of symmetry and temporal context information to a deep CNN with the purpose of detecting malignant soft tissue lesions in mammography. We employ a simple linear mapping that takes the location of a mass candidate and maps it to either the contra-lateral or prior mammogram and Regions Of Interest (ROI) are extracted around each location. We subsequently explore two different architectures (1) a fusion model employing two datastreams were both ROIs are fed to the network during training and testing and (2) a stage-wise approach where a single ROI CNN is trained on the primary image and subsequently used as feature extractor for both primary and symmetrical or prior ROIs. A 'shallow' Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT) classifier is then trained on the concatenation of these features and used to classify the joint representation. Results shown a significant increase in performance using the first architecture and symmetry information, but only marginal gains in performance using temporal data and the other setting. We feel results are promising and can greatly be improved when more temporal data becomes available.},

Early detection has been shown to significantly improve chances of survival and therefore screening, where asymptomatic women in high risk subpopulations are invited for annual or biennial breast exams, is being performed in many countries. These programs generate an enormous amount of data which have to be read by trained experts, often a time consuming and error prone process. To mitigate this, computer aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) systems are being developed to aid and ultimately replace human readers of various medical images.},

  title = {Vein Segmentation from 3D High Resolution {MR} Venograms by Using Vessel Enhancing Diffusion},
  booktitle = ESMRMB,
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {1. Purpose: There is widespread interest in the segmentation of blood vessels in the brain, for example to study cerebral aneurysms and stenosis. However manual segmentation of veins in an (MR) brain dataset is a cumbersome task and therefore an automated approach is desirable. In 1998 Frangi et al. [1] designed a multiscale vessel-likeliness filter which can automatically segment vessels in CT and contrast enhanced MR angiograms. Recently it was shown that the filter could also be applied to susceptibility weighted images (SWI) in which veins are dark with respect to brain tissue [2]. In this study, an additional filtering technique, vessel enhancing diffusion (VED) [3,4], was applied on a functional SWI dataset [5] in both a low SNR (single functional volume) and a high SNR (averaged volume) scenario. The performance was compared to Frangi-only segmentation with manual segmentation serving as a reference. 2. Methods and Materials: A healthy subject, male 25y, was studied using a Siemens Trio 3T system after informed consent was given. The datasets of the brain were acquired using a high resolution 3D flow-compensated gradient echo FLASH sequence and an 8 channel occipital coil array. The parameters were as follows: matrix size 144x192, 40 slices, resolution 0.75x0.75x0.75 mm3, acquisition time 2 minutes per volume, 8 volumes in total. Since this data was part of a functional SWI study of the human visual cortex [5], only this part of the brain was scanned. The approximate orientation and position of the central slice can be seen in fig. 1a. Due to the nature of the occipital coil array a large signal intensity inhomogeneity is present (fig. 1a-b). Because part of the Frangi filter (see below) is sensitive to (absolute) intensity values, this intensity inhomogeneity was corrected for using a low frequency bias field (fig. 1c). The filters were applied to both a single volume and the averaged volume (after motion correction) to check the performance in a low and high SNR situation, respectively (fig. 1d-e). Manual segmentation was performed on the average volume. 3. Results: Figure 3 shows the maximum intensity projections of the Frangi filter output using three different background noise suppression settings all at the same level and window settings. For both the low SNR dataset in the top as the high SNR dataset in the bottom row, clearly the lowest setting (2%) fails to produce a good contrast between the veins and the background. Even after changing the level and window settings (not shown here) the contrast hardly improved. The 20% setting suppresses the noise well in the high SNR regions, the low SNR regions are still noisy. Increasing the noise suppression further however does not improve the contrast in these anterior regions. 4. Conclusion: VED filtering outperforms Frangi filtering in regions of low SNR, suppressing more noise while leaving the underlying veins intact. In regions of high SNR the smoothing effect of the diffusion approach reduces the amount of detail.},

Optimum TE was found to be 15 ms which is supported by theoretical considerations. Using this optimum TE, we acquired 3D high resolution datasets with a large volume coverage in a short measurement time that show very detailed microanatomical structures of the human brain such as intracortical veins and laminar cortical substructures. CONCLUSIONS: By applying optimised vessel filters (vesselness filter and vessel enhancing diffusion) whole brain MR venograms can be obtained at 7 T with a significantly reduced measurement time compared to 3 T.},

  title = {Vein Classification using Vesselness Filters on {SWI} Data Acquired at {3T} and {7T}},
  booktitle = ISMRM,
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {Introduction: MR venography based upon susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) can depict the venous vascular tree with excellent detail by using minimum intensity projections (mIP) over several slices [1]. While this visualisation works quite nicely, this approach does not classify veins, which can be necessary, e.g. to remove veins from high resolution functional MRI scans. To solve this it has been proposed to use filters known from angiography [2]. In this study we assessed the performance of two such filters: the Utrecht vesselness filter and Vessel Enhancing Diffusion (VED) in regions of high and low SNR. As higher field strengths are beneficial for SWI venography the VED filter was used on SWI data acquired at 7T and compared with 3T data. Methods:All experiments were performed on whole body MRI scanners (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) at field strengths of 3T and 7T. SWI images were acquired using a firstorder flow-compensated 3D gradient echo FLASH sequence with the following parameters: FA 15A-A?A 1/2 , BW 120 Hz/pixel, acceleration factor 2 (GRAPPA). At 3T we used an echo time of 28 ms with a TR of 35 ms, at 7T these were 15 ms and 22 ms respectively. Whole brain sagittal acquisitions were performed on the same subject at both fields using a matrix size of 352x448x144 and a resolution of 0.57x0.57x1.25 mm3. Acquisition times were 15 and 10 minutes at 3T and 7T respectively. To test the filters in regions of high and low SNR a dataset was acquired using an eight channel occipital surface coil array [3]. In order to increase SNR an average over 4 repetitions was used. Matrix size was 144x192x40 using an isotropic resolution of 0.75 mm. Acquisition time was 2 minutes per volume. All datasets were intensityinhomogeneity corrected and veins were segmented using the Utrecht vesselness filter and VED which are described in detail in [4] and [5] respectively. In short, the Utrecht filter uses second order image information to distinguish dark tube-like structures (veins) from their surroundings and noise. The VED filter uses an iterative approach by alternately applying the Utrecht filter and a diffusion process to eliminate noise. However the shape/direction of the diffusion is dependent on the vessel likeliness found by the previous iteration of the Utrecht filter. For voxels that do not belong to the venous tree, the diffusion is isotropic, for venous voxels diffusion is applied in the direction of the vessel. This diffusion process improves the starting conditions for the next Utrecht filter step. In this study 5 iterations were used. In addition to the automated filters, manual segmentation was performed on the 0.75 mm resolution dataset to be compared with the VED result. Results: Fig. 1a shows a mIP over 11 slices of the dataset acquired using the occipital coil. Fig. 1b shows the maximum intensity projection (MIP) of the output of the Utrecht filter, fig. 1c shows the MIP of the VED result. In the bottom part of the images, where SNR is relatively high, both filters perform very well. In the top part, where SNR is reduced due to the inhomogeneous coil profile, the VED method is better able to contrast veins with respect to the noisy background than the Utrecht filter. Fig. 2 shows the manual segmentation (a) and the VED result (b) overlaid on the mIP of the data. Apart from the very top part of the image (where SNR was extremely low) both results are in excellent agreement. Conclusion: Two automated vein segmentation filters have been applied to SWI-venography data. In regions of high SNR the Utrecht vesselness filter and the vessel enhancing diffusion method both performed very well. In regions of low SNR the VED method outperformed the Utrecht filter and the result was in excellent agreement with manual segmentation results. The VED filter was applied to whole brain 3T and 7T data where A-A?A 1/2  due to the huge amount of visible veins - manual segmentation can no longer be considered a possibility. Although the results at 3T were slightly better than at 7T due to increased SNR inhomogeneity at the latter
                             field strength, 7T allows for a much shorter acquisition time and therefore shows good promise for future SWI-venography.},

In more recent years, this field of research has expanded by evaluating the costs of abruptly switching between such different tasks. At the same time, the field of classifying oculomotor behavior has been moving toward more advanced, data-driven methods of decoding data. For the current study, we used a large dataset compiled over multiple experiments and implemented separate state-of-the-art machine learning methods for decoding both cognitive state and task-switching. We found that, by extracting a wide range of oculomotor features, we were able to implement robust classifier models for decoding both cognitive state and task-switching. Our decoding performance highlights the feasibility of this approach, even invariant of image statistics. Additionally, we present a feature ranking for both models, indicating the relative magnitude of different oculomotor features for both classifiers. These rankings indicate a separate set of important predictors for decoding each task, respectively. Finally, we discuss the implications of the current approach related to interpreting the decoding results.},

Dynamic CTA techniques, also referred to as 4D-CTA, have become available for clinical practice in recent years. This article provides a description of 4D-CTA techniques and a review of the available literature on the application of 4D-CTA for the evaluation of intracranial vascular malformations and hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. Most of the research performed to date consists of observational cohort studies or descriptive case series. These studies show that intracranial vascular malformations can be adequately depicted and classified by 4D-CTA, with DSA as the reference standard. In ischemic stroke, 4D-CTA better estimates thrombus burden and the presence of collateral vessels than conventional CTA. In intracranial hemorrhage, 4D-CTA improves the detection of the spot sign, which represents active ongoing bleeding.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death and is in the majority of cases due to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in arteries. Initially, thickening of the inner layer of the arterial wall occurs. Continuation of this process leads to plaque formation. The risk of a plaque to rupture and thus to induce an ischemic event is directly related to its composition. Consequently, characterization of the plaque composition as well as its proneness to rupture are of crucial importance for risk assessment and treatment strategies. The carotid is an excellent artery to be imaged with ultrasound because of its superficial position. In this review, ultrasound based methods for characterizing the mechanical properties of the carotid wall and atherosclerotic plaque are discussed. Using conventional echography, the Intima Media Thickness (IMT) can be quantified. There is a wealth of studies describing the relation between IMT and the risk for myocardial infarction and stroke. Also the carotid distensibility can be quantified with ultrasound, providing a surrogate marker for the cross sectional mechanical properties. Although all these parameters are associated with cardiovascular disease, they do not easily translate to individual patient risk. Another technique is Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) assessment, which measures the propagation of the pressure pulse over the arterial bed. PWV has proven to be a marker for global arterial stiffness. Recently, an ultrasound-based method to estimate the local PWV has been introduced but the clinical effectiveness still needs to be established. Other techniques focus on characterization of plaques. With ultrasound elastography, the strain in the plaque due to the pulsatile pressure can be quantified. This technique was initially developed using intravascular catheters to image coronaries, but recently non-invasive methods were successfully developed. A high correlation between the measured strain and the risk for rupture was esta- lished. Acoustic Radiation Force Imaging (ARFI) also provides characterization of local plaque components based on mechanical properties. However, both elastography and ARFI provide an indirect measure of the elastic modulus of tissue. With shear wave imaging (SWI), the elastic modulus can be quantified, although the carotid artery is one of the most challenging tissues for this technique due to its size and geometry. Prospective studies still have to establish the predictive value of these techniques for the individual patient. Validation of ultrasound-based mechanical characterization of arteries and plaques remains challenging. MRI is often used as gold standard for plaque characterization, but its limited resolution only renders global characterization of the plaque. CT provides information on the vascular tree, the degree of stenosis and presence of calcified plaque, while soft plaque characterization remains limited. Histology still is the gold standard but is only available if tissue is excised. In conclusion, elastographic ultrasound techniques are well suited to characterize the different stages of vascular disease.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: Brain extraction methods in {MRI} have so far been exclusively developed for T1- and T2-weighted images. A deep neural network is presented to segment the brain tissue in susceptibility-weighted images ({SWI}) in healthy individuals and patients with traumatic brain injury ({TBI}).
                             MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, {MRI} scans from 33 patients with moderate to severe {TBI} and 18 healthy controls were collected. {SWI}s were acquired with 27ms {TR}, 20ms {TE}, 15deg flip angle, and0.98x0.98x1.00mm3 voxel size on a {3T} Siemens MRI scanner. A small scale 2D-U-Net was implemented (18 convolution layers, max. 256 features per layer) processing a volume in axial direction. The U-Net architecture allowed the model to utilize both local and contextual information. The output probability maps were thresholded and possible outliers were removed by taking the largest connected component. 20 {TBI} patients and 10 controls served as a test set, the remaining patients were used for training. The reference standard were brain masks obtained with {SPM}, a publicly available software package commonly used for brain extractions in {MR} neuroimaging, but not optimized for {SWI} sequences. These annotations were visually inspected. The results of the deep learning method were visually inspected for completeness and overall quality. Dice similarity coefficient ({DCS}) and the modified Hausdorff ({MHD}) distance were reported for the test set.
                             RESULTS: The {DCS} was 0.98+-0.002 per volume at the chosen operating point on the SPM standard and the {MHD} was 0.93+-0.11mm per volume. It took less than 10 seconds to compute the complete 3D brain mask on a modern {GPU}. Overall, our method was capable of learning from a sub-optimal reference standard and extracting the brain in an {SWI} image. It mimicked some of the deficiencies of the {SPM} brain masks, such as occasional failures in the most inferior or superior axial slices, but also mitigated others through generalization over the training set. Holes in the mask caused by contusions or hematomas were less prevalent with the 2D-U-Net than with {SPM}.
                             CONCLUSION: The 2D-U-Net method provides fast brain extractions in {MR-SWI}.},

  abstract = {Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are a recognised biomarker of traumatic axonal injury (TAI). Their number and location provide valuable information in the long-term prognosis of patients who sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Accurate detection of CMBs is necessary for both research and clinical applications. CMBs appear as small hypointense lesions on susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (SWI). Their size and shape vary markedly in cases of TBI. Manual annotation of CMBs is a difficult, error-prone, and time-consuming task. Several studies addressed the detection of CMBs in other neuropathologies with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this study, we developed and contrasted a classification (Patch-CNN) and two segmentation (Segmentation-CNN, U-Net) approaches for the detection of CMBs in TBI cases. The models were trained using 45 datasets, and the best models were chosen according to 16 validation sets. Finally, the models were evaluated on 10 TBI and healthy control cases, respectively. Our three models outperform the current status quo in the detection of traumatic CMBs, achieving higher sensitivity at low false positive (FP) counts. Furthermore, using a segmentation approach allows for better precision. The best model, the U-Net, achieves a detection rate of 90\% at FP counts of 17.1 in TBI patients and 3.4 in healthy controls.},

However, the selection of patients without collateral ventilation prior to treatment is critical for procedural success. Collateral ventilation can be assessed directly with the Chartis system or indirectly using computed tomography (CT) fissure analysis. We retrospectively evaluated the diagnostic value of a combination of the quantitative CT interlobar fissure completeness score (FCS) and Chartis in predicting responders to EBV therapy. CT data from four prospective studies were pooled and analyzed using semiautomated software to quantify the completeness of interlobar fissures. These FCSs were compared to a reference standard of achieving $>$350 ml of target lobe volume reduction after EBV treatment. Using a receiver operating characteristic curve, optimal thresholds predictive of complete fissures (responders) and incomplete fissures (non-responders) were determined. A subgroup of patients with partially complete fissures was identified, where software had lower accuracy. The complementary value of Chartis was investigated in this group. A fissure was defined as complete (FCS >95\%), incomplete (FCS <80\%), or partially complete (80\% < FCS < 95\%). The positive predictive value (PPV) of complete fissures is 88.1\%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) is 92.9\%, with an overall accuracy of 89.2%. Chartis was utilized in patients with partially complete fissures, with a PPV of 82.3\%, an NPV of 84.6\%, and an accuracy of 83.3\%. Combining diagnostic tools could reduce the burden on patients and the healthcare system while providing clinicians with a better means for patient selection for EBV therapy.},

  abstract = {Background. Mechanical ventilation (MV) induces an inflammatory response that can lead to lung injury. The vagus nerve can limit the inflammatory response through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. We evaluated the effects of stimulation of the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway with the selective partial a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a7nAChR) agonist GTS-21 on inflammation and lung injury induced by MV using clinically relevant ventilator settings. Furthermore, we investigated whether altering endogenous cholinergic signalling, by administration of the non-speci?c nAChR antagonist mecamylamine and the peripherally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine, modulates the MV-induced inflammatory response. Methods. C57BL6 mice were injected i.p. with either the selective a7nAChR agonist GTS-21 (8 mg kg21), the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine (80 mg kg21), the nAChR antagonist mecamylamine (1 mg kg21), or a placebo; followed by 4 h of MV (8 ml kg21, 1.5 cm H2O PEEP). Results. MV resulted in release of cytokines in plasma and lungs compared with unventilated mice. Lung and plasma levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, but not of interleukin-10, were lower in GTS-21-treated animals compared with placebo (P,0.05). In addition, GTS-21 lowered the alveolar-arterial gradient, indicating improved lung function (P 1/4 0.04). Neither neostigmine nor mecamylamine had an effect on MV-induced inflammation or lung function. Conclusions. MV with clinically relevant ventilator settings results in pulmonary and systemic inflammation. Stimulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway with GTS-21 attenuates MV-induced release of TNF-a, which was associated with reduced lung injury. Modulation of endogenous cholinergic signalling did not affect the MV-induced inflammatory response. Selective stimulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway may represent new treatment options for MV-induced lung injury.},

In this paper we developed and experimented with two cascaded fully convolutionalneural network (FCN) approaches that work in 2D and 2.5D. The first U-Net focused on providing a liver prediction mask which was subsequent utilized as additional input for the second U-Nets. In these U-Nets, one received the liver prediction mask as an additional input channel, and the other utilized the same mask to discard the non-liver background. The networks were trained and tested on the Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS) dataset, consisting of 201 contrast-enhanced abdominal CT studies. Results of the rst FCN yielded 95% Dice score for the liver segmentation on the validation set. The U-Net with 3 slice input and masked-out non-liver background was the best performing network, and obtained 0.563 Dice score on the LiTS test set. Overall, both cascaded FCN approaches were found very promising performance-wise in comparison to a single slice input without information from the liver prediction mask. Further improvements can be made by addressing the qualitatively derived egmentation challenges as well as improving the networks by exploring the implementation of ResNet connections and additional post-processing steps.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a widely accepted concept that identifies the centrally obese patient with increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, most studies indicate that the syndrome does not predict cardiovascular disease any better than the sum of its components. In addition, the single components seem to be interrelated. Therefore, we evaluated the use of automatic quantification of abdominal visceral fat content as a new marker of MetS, the single components and long-term cardiac survival. Methods: Prior to aortic aneurysm repair, 106 patients underwent computed tomography (CT) scanning of the abdominal aorta. Using a fully automated and intrinsically CT-3D image analysis method, visceral fat volume was calculated. MetS was defined according the Adult Treatment Panel III report (ATP III) and central obesity as body-mass-index (BMI) >30 kg/m2. Correlations between visceral fat volumes, MetS, the single components and long-term cardiac survival were investigated. Median follow-up was 2.6 years (IQR 1.2-3.6). Results: Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed in 46 (43%) patients. Increased visceral fat volume was not associated with the presence of MetS (p=0.26). In contrast, visceral fat volumes were significantly correlated with BMI and HDL-cholesterol. (Pearson's coefficient: BMI: r=0.51, HDL: r=-0.35). During follow-up 9 (8%) patients died. Increased visceral fat volume was significantly associated with increased mortality risk (p=0.03) (Table). Conclusion: The automatic quantified abdominal visceral fat content was not correlated with MetS. However, increased visceral fat volume seems to be a true marker of increased BMI, reduced HDL-cholesterol and increased long-term cardiac mortality.},

The prognostic impact of MAGE expression was validated in the TMA cohort and also in TCGA data (mRNA). OS was significantly lower for patients expressing pan-MAGE or MAGE-A3/A4 in both independent cohorts.MAGE expression was confirmed as a prognostic marker in HNSCC and may be important for immunotherapeutic strategies as a shared antigen.},

METHODS: In this retrospective, multi-reader multi-case study, a consecutive set of 184 patients examined between 01/2018 and 08/2019 were enrolled. Ground truth was combined targeted and 12-core systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. Four radiologists, two experienced and two less-experienced, evaluated each case twice, once without (DL-CAD-) and once assisted by DL-CAD (DL-CAD+). ROC analysis, sensitivities, specificities, PPV and NPV were calculated to compare the diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) between the two groups (DL-CAD- vs. DL-CAD+). Spearman's correlation coefficients were evaluated to assess the relationship between PI-RADS category and Gleason score (GS). Also, the median reading times were compared for the two reading groups. RESULTS: In total, 172 patients were included in the final analysis. With DL-CAD assistance, the overall AUC of the less-experienced radiologists increased significantly from 0.66 to 0.80 (p = 0.001; cutoff ISUP GG >= 1) and from 0.68 to 0.80 (p = 0.002; cutoff ISUP GG >= 2). Experienced radiologists showed an AUC increase from 0.81 to 0.86 (p = 0.146; cutoff ISUP GG >= 1) and from 0.81 to 0.84 (p = 0.433; cutoff ISUP GG >= 2). Furthermore, the correlation between PI-RADS category and GS improved significantly in the DL-CAD + group (0.45 vs. 0.57; p = 0.03), while the median reading time was reduced from 157 to 150 s (p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: DL-CAD assistance increased the mean detection performance, with the most significant benefit for the less-experienced radiologist; with the help of DL-CAD less-experienced radiologists reached performances comparable to that of experienced radiologists.},

  abstract = {Trough detailed simulations of air showers and their geosynchrotron radio emission, we have derived an empirical relation between the relative delay of the radio pulse emitted by the air shower front and the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum. By analysis of the radio pulse arrival delays in radio antennas in an array of low-frequency radioantennas, this relation can be used to estimate the depth-of-maximum if the impact position is known or vice versa. We have confirmed that bothmethodswork in principle, with no information other than radio signal delays used in the reconstruction. When the algorithm is tested under realistic conditions, however, the accuracy of the method is reduced. In the case of determining the shower maximum, reconstruction down to a useful con!dence level is possible only for shower maxima up to ~7 km away, and only if the shower core impact position is known down to a few meters. When the parameterization is used to derive this position, the critical quantity is the accuracy in the zenith angle of the shower, which needs to be signi!cantly less than a degree to reconstruct the shower impact location to an accuracy of 10m at high inclinations up to 60 degrees.},

Participants provided written informed consent. Of the 8,061 invitees, 66% answered that they were interested, and 59% eventually participated. Participants were on average 54-years old (interquartile range: 51-59 years), comparable to women with extremely dense breasts in the population-based screening programme (55 years). Women with higher socio-economic status (SES) were more often interested in participation than women with lower SES (68% versus 59%, p<0.001). The most frequently stated reasons for non-participation were "MRI-related inconveniences and/or self-reported contraindications to MRI" (27%) and "anxiety regarding the result of supplemental screening" (21%). "Expected personal health benefit" (68%) and "contribution to science" (43%) were the most frequent reasons for participation. Of women invited for MRI because of extremely dense breasts, 59% participated. Common reasons for non-participation were "MRI-related inconveniences" and "anxiety regarding the result of supplemental screening". In case of future implementation, availability of precise evidence on benefits and harms might reduce this anxiety.},

  abstract = {Lobe-based quantification of tomographic images is of increasing interest for diagnosis and monitoring lung pathology. With modern tomography scanners providing data sets with hundreds of slices, manual segmentation is time-consuming and not feasible in the clinical routine. Especially for patients with severe lung pathology that are of particular clinical importance, automatic segmentation approaches frequently generate partially inaccurate or even completely unacceptable results. In this work we present a modality-independent, semi-automated method that can be used both for generic correction of any existing lung lobe segmentation and for segmentation from scratch. Intuitive slice-based drawing of fissure parts is used to introduce user knowledge. Internally, the current fissure is represented as sampling points in 3{D} space that are interpolated to a fissure surface. Using morphological processing, a 3{D} impact region is computed for each user-drawn 2{D} curve. Based on the curve and impact region, the updated lobar boundary surface is immediately computed after each interaction step to provide instant user feedback. The method was evaluated on 25 normal-dose {CT} scans with a reference standard provided by a human observer. When segmenting from scratch, the average distance to the reference standard was 1.6mm using an average of five interactions and 50 seconds of interaction time per case. When correcting inadequate automatic segmentations, the initial error was reduced from 13.9 to 1.9mm with comparable efforts. The evaluation shows that both correction of a given segmentation and segmentation from scratch can be successfully performed with little interaction in a short amount of time.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {{PURPOSE} Segmentation of the pulmonary lobes in {CT} data is useful for diagnosis, monitoring, and quantification of pulmonary diseases. In patients with severe disease, automated lobe segmentation is infeasible and interactive methods are needed. {METHOD AND MATERIALS} An automated lobar segmentation method was developed that performs a watershed transformation with a cost image based on the information from fissures, bronchi, and pulmonary vessels. Lobar markers required by the watershed transformation are calculated by an analysis of the automatically labeled bronchial tree. This segmentation fails on cases with severe disease or largely incomplete fissures. Therefore an interactive method was developed where an observer adjusts the automatic result by drawing parts of the correct lobar boundaries on any plane. Each curve is converted to a set of sampling points and the software immediately adapts the segmentation on the current plane but also extrapolates intelligently to adjacent slices. The immediate feedback allows the user to refine the segmentation iteratively, typically on multiple orthogonal planes. The procedure can also be performed from scratch. A set of 55 publically available chest {CT} scans with submillimeter resolution from a lung and lung lobe segmentation challenge ({LOLA11}) was used for evaluation. This data set contains many difficult cases with gross abnormalities. An observer applied the interactive correction using the automatic result as starting point and performed the full lobar segmentation from scratch for each scan. {RESULTS} The overall score based on the average overlap with a {LOLA11} reference standard for the 5 lobes was 0.881 for the automatic method. The interactive corrections improved this to 0.918. The observer needed on average 7 interactions in 1.5 minutes per scan. The segmentation from scratch reached an overall score of 0.923 and required on average 4 minutes of processing time per scan. {CONCLUSION} Fast interactive lobar segmentation in thoracic {CT} is feasible. {CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION} Lobar segmentation is a prerequisite for regional quantitative analysis of chest {CT} and other applications such as surgery planning and automated diagnosis.},

  title = {Automated and interactive image analysis workstation for the extraction of imaging biomarkers related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from thoracic computed tomography scans},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) is a leading and rising cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with 12 million people in the United States currently diagnosed. An increasing number of paired inspiratory and expiratory computed tomography ({CT}) scans are taken of patients with {COPD} but clinically available workstations do not provide the tools needed for interpretation of these scans. To gain insight into the underlying pathways of {COPD} and monitor progression, methods to extract imaging biomarkers and visualize {COPD} from chest {CT} scans are of crucial importance. We have developed a workstation that allows visualization of inspiratory and expiratory {CT} simultaneously, extracts quantifiable features from both the inspiration and expiration {CT} related to parenchyma and airway morphology, displays the results in the scans, allows for interactive correction, and produces structured reports. The software is currently available as a research prototype and is used for the analysis of scans made for pharmaceutical trials. It is not yet commercially available and open-source licenses to not apply. {METHODOLOGY/APPLICATION} The workstation has the following features and workflow: When a study is sent to the workstation two preprocessing steps are performed. An elastic registration between the inspiration and expiration scans is performed to allow for linking of spatial locations between the inspiration and expiration scans. The lungs, lobes, airways, fissures, and segments are automatically segmented [1] allowing regional analysis. The preprocessing is performed offline and preloaded in the background such that a user of the workstation has the results readily available when viewing the scan. Once the preprocessing is finished the study is available for analysis in the workstation. On opening a study, the user can scroll through the inspiratory and expiratory {CT} simultaneously in any direction to visually inspect the scans. The results of the automatic segmentations of anatomical structures can be overlayed on the scans. In case the user is not satisfied with the segmentation results of the lungs or lung lobes the observer can correct the segmentation in a short time with an intuitive interactive correction method [2]. Once the segmentations have been approved, a range of quantifiable features can be visualized in the workstation: parenchyma features, airway features [3], and fissure completeness [4]. All relevant measurements are reported for both inspiration and expiration for the whole lung as well as per lobe and segment to allow for regional analysis. In addition, the changes between inspiration and expiration are reported. After workup of a study of a {COPD} patient, a structured report is produced that contains screenshots, renderings, and all requested measurements. The reports are created in {HTML} and {PDF} format, allowing them to be viewed in the workstation as well as in other environments. {DEMONSTRATION STRATEGY} For the exhibit an informational poster will be present that highlights the key aspects of the here proposed workstation and workflow. The underlying algorithms will be explained and the use of the analysis showcased with example scans. Attendees will be able to gain hands-on experience with the workstation, inspect the results of automatic processing, interact with the methods, and obtain structured reports of the findings.},

  title = {Fully Automatic Volumetric Segmentation of Pulmonary Nodules: Evaluation using the Complete {LIDC/IDRI} Database},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {PURPOSE In the publicly available LIDC/IDRI database, all nodules larger than 3mm have been manually segmented by four expert thoracic radiologists. This provides a unique opportunity for large scale validation. We report the performance of our automatic method to segment pulmonary nodules and compare this to inter-reader variability. METHOD AND MATERIALS We developed an automatic nodule segmentation method which is initialized by region growing from a seed point in the nodule. Thresholds for region growing are automatically determined from histogram analysis. A circumscribing ellipsoid is approximated to separate nodules from the chest wall. Finally, through a combination of connected component analysis and morphological operations vasculature attached to the nodule is removed. To evaluate our automatic method, it was applied four times using a random seed point in each nodule in the LIDC/IDRI database that contains 1,018 chest CT scans from 1,000 patients, acquired at seven different institutions with a wide variety of scanners and imaging protocols. In these scans, 928 nodules were manually segmented independently by four radiologists by drawing contours on each axial section containing the nodule. The DICE overlap between the resulting automatic outline and the three other manual segmentations was computed. Similarly, each manual segmentation was compared to the three other manual outlines. We report statistics of the averaged DICE coefficients. RESULTS We achieved excellent agreement between our automatic and manual segmentation results. Mean DICE was 0.75 A,A+- 0.16 for the automatic method and 0.77 A,A+- 0.09 for the inter-observer agreement. The first quartile, median, and third quartile for the automatic method were 0.71, 0.79. 0.84, respectively. For the manual outlines, these statistics were 0.73, 0.79, 0.83. CONCLUSION Automated nodule segmentation is feasible in CT scans obtained with varying acquisition parameters with a performance close to manual outlining by expert thoracic radiologists. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Automatic volumetric nodule segmentation is a robust, efficient and highly effective technique for the analysis of pulmonary nodules in CT data.},

  abstract = {The malignancy of lung nodules is most often detected by analyzing changes of the nodule diameter in follow-up scans. A recent study showed that comparing the volume or the mass of a nodule over time is much more significant than comparing the diameter. Since the survival rate is higher when the disease is still in an early stage it is important to detect the growth rate as soon as possible. However manual segmentation of a volume is time-consuming. Whereas there are several well evaluated methods for the segmentation of solid nodules, less work is done on subsolid nodules which actually show a higher malignancy rate than solid nodules. In this work we present a fast, semi-automatic method for segmentation of subsolid nodules.As minimal user interaction the method expects a user-drawn stroke on the largest diameter of the nodule. First, a threshold-based region growing is performed based on intensity analysis of the nodule region and surrounding parenchyma. In the next step the chest wall is removed by a combination of a connected component analyses and convex hull calculation. Finally, attached vessels are detached by morphological operations.The method was evaluated on all nodules of the publicly available LIDC/IDRI database that were manually segmented and rated as non-solid or part-solid by four radiologists (Dataset 1) and three radiologists (Dataset 2). For these 59 nodules the Jaccard index for the agreement of the proposed method with the manual reference segmentations was 0.52/0.50 (Dataset 1/Dataset 2) compared to an inter-observer agreement of the manual segmentations of 0.54/0.58 (Dataset 1/Dataset 2). Furthermore, the inter-observer agreement using the proposed method (i.e. different input strokes) was analyzed and gave a Jaccard index of 0.74/0.74 (Dataset 1/Dataset 2).The presented method provides satisfactory segmentation results with minimal observer effort in minimal time and can reduce the inter-observer variability for segmentation of subsolid nodules in clinical routine.},

Chapter 3 describes a complete segmentation workflow for the pulmonary lobes. The first step is the automatic segmentation presented in Chapter 2. The second step is a 3D geometric method that enables fast and intuitive correction of a given lung lobe segmentation. Also a segmentation from scratch only based on a lung mask is allowed. The boundary between the lobes is represented as a mesh that can be modified by drawing the correct boundary on 2D slices in arbitrary orientation. After each drawing, the mesh is immediately adapted in a 3D region around the user interaction. For evaluation we also participated in the LOLA11 challenge with both the correction and the segmentation from scratch. Two observers applied the approach to correct the automatic segmentation results and one observer did a segmentation from scratch for all of the 55 datasets provided by the challenge. In Chapter 4 an automatic nodule segmentation approach is introduced. A user provides a stroke on the largest diameter of the nodule to initialize the method. Then, a threshold-based region growing is performed based on an intensity analysis around the stroke and surrounding parenchyma. A combination of a connected component analysis and convex hull calculation separates the nodule from the chest wall. Finally, vessels attached to the nodule are removed by morphological operations. The method was evaluated on 59 subsolid publically available nodules provided by LIDC/IDRI. Chapter 5 presents a complete segmentation workflow for pulmonary nodules. As a first step a similar approach to the one introduced in Chapter 4 but with an initial seedpoint instead of a stroke is applied. For the cases with insufficient results an interactive step follows. Here the user can choose between seven precalculated segmentation results. These are also created with the automatic segmentation method but with varying parameters for the threshold-based region growing. This workflow was evaluated on 907 publically available pulmonary nodules provided by LIDC/IDRI. In addition, reliability of volumetric measurement is compared to 2D metrics. Chapters 6 and 7 give a summary of the thesis and a general discussion.},

  abstract = {Automated lung lobe segmentation methods often fail for challenging and clinically relevant cases with incomplete fissures or substantial amounts of pathology. We present a fast and intuitive method to interactively correct a given lung lobe segmentation or to quickly create a lobe segmentation from scratch based on a lung mask.&#13; A given lobar boundary is converted into a mesh by principal component analysis of 3D lobar boundary markers to obtain a plane where nodes correspond to the position of the markers. An observer can modify the mesh by drawing on 2D slices in arbitrary orientations. After each drawing, the mesh is immediately adapted in a 3D region around the user interaction.&#13; For evaluation we participated in the international lung lobe segmentation challenge LObe and Lung Analysis 2011 (LOLA11). Two observers applied the method to correct a given lung lobe segmentation obtained by a fully automatic method for all 55 CT scans of LOLA11.&#13; &#13; On average observer 1/2 required 8+-4/25+-12 interactions per case and took 1:30+-0:34/3:19+-1:29 min. The average distances to the reference segmentation were improved from an initial 2.68+-14.71 mm to 0.89+-1.63/0.74+-1.51 mm. In addition, one observer applied the proposed method to create a segmentation from scratch. This took 3:44+-0:58 minutes on average per case, applying an average of 20+-3 interactions to reach an average distance to the reference of 0.77+-1.14 mm.&#13; Thus, both the interactive corrections and the creation of a segmentation from scratch were feasible in a short time with excellent results and minimal interaction. Since the mesh adaptation is independent of image features, the method can successfully handle patients with severe pathologies, provided that the human operator is capable of correctly indicating the lobar boundaries.},

  abstract = {In this work a fully automated detection method for artery input function (AIF) and venous output function (VOF) in 4D-computer tomography (4D-CT) data is presented based on unsupervised classification of the time intensity curves (TIC) as input data. Bone and air voxels are first masked out using thresholding of the baseline measurement. The TICs for each remaining voxel are converted to time-concentration-curves (TCC) by subtracting the baseline value from the TIC. Then, an unsupervised K-means classifier is applied to each TCC with an area under the curve (AUC) larger than 95% of the maximum AUC of all TCCs. The results are three clusters, which yield average TCCs for vein and artery voxels in the brain, respectively. A third cluster generally represents a vessel outside the brain. The algorithm was applied to five 4D-CT patient data who were scanned on the suspicion of ischemic stroke. For all _ve patients, the algorithm yields reasonable classification of arteries and veins as well as reasonable and reproducible AIFs and VOF. To our knowledge, this is the first application of an unsupervised classification method to automatically identify arteries and veins in 4D-CT data. Preliminary results show the feasibility of using K-means clustering for the purpose of artery-vein detection in 4D-CT patient data.},

  abstract = {Many therapeutic approaches to cancer affect the tumour vasculature, either indirectly or as a direct target. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) has become an important means of investigating this action, both pre-clinically and in early stage clinical trials. For such trials, it is essential that the measurement process (i.e. image acquisition and analysis) can be performed effectively and with consistency among contributing centres. As the technique continues to develop in order to provide potential improvements in sensitivity and physiological relevance, there is considerable scope for between-centre variation in techniques. A workshop was convened by the Imaging Committee of the Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres (ECMC) to review the current status of DCE-MRI and to provide recommendations on how the technique can best be used for early stage trials. This review and the consequent recommendations are summarised here. Key Points A-A?A 1/2  Tumour vascular function is key to tumour development and treatment A-A?A 1/2  Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) can assess tumour vascular function A-A?A 1/2  Thus DCE-MRI with pharmacokinetic models can assess novel treatments A-A?A 1/2  Many recent developments are advancing the accuracy of and information from DCE-MRI A-A?A 1/2  Establishing common methodology across multiple centres is challenging and requires accepted guidelines.},

  abstract = {Early detection of pulmonary nodules is crucial for improving prognosis of patients with lung cancer. Computer-aided detection of lung nodules in thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans has a great potential to enhance the performance of the radiologist in detecting nodules. In this paper we present a computer-aided lung nodule detection system for computed tomography (CT) scans that works in three steps. The system first segments the lung using thresholding and hole filling. From this segmentation the system extracts candidate nodules using Laplacian of Gaussian. To reject false positives among the detected candidate nodules, multiple established features are calculated. We propose a novel feature based on a spherical shell filter, which is specifically designed to distinguish between vascular structures and nodular structures. The performance of the proposed CAD system was evaluated by partaking in the ANODE09 challenge, which presents a platform for comparing automatic nodule detection programs. The results from the challenge show that our CAD system ranks third among the submitted works, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed CAD system. The results also show that our proposed spherical shell filter in combination with conventional features can significantly reduce the number of false positives from the detected candidate nodules.},

  booktitle = ECR,
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Purpose: Segmentation of cerebral white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in head CT is important for subsequent quantitative analysis and automated detection of cerebral pathology. We introduce VCAST, a new volumetric annotation tool aimed at delineating soft tissue in non-contrast CT (NCCT) and CT perfusion (CTP).
                             Methods and Materials: VCAST supports traditional 2D visualizations and annotations, and provides functionalities to facilitate 3D segmentations based on pre-calculated grids of volumetric clusters where the clusters are spatially coherently grouped based on HUs. Clicking a cluster in a 2D-plane allows for inclusion of the 3D-cluster in the output segmentation.
                             Ten patients with suspicion of ischemic stroke were included in this retrospective study, five NCCTs and five whole brain CTPs (320-row detector scanner). Temporal average CTA was reconstructed from CTP and in one slice in arbitrary direction, WM, GM and CSF were annotated two times by one observer using VCAST. In NCCT, a subvolume of approximately 22 mm^3 was randomly selected in which CSF was annotated by one observer, using VCAST either with 2D (slice-based) or 2D and 3D (cluster-based) annotation support. Dice coefficients and annotation times were reported.
                             Results: Dice coefficients were 0.86A+-0.04, 0.91A+-0.02, 0.87A+-0.02 for CSF, GM and WM respectively. CSF annotation times reduced from 16A+-9 to 8A+-5 minutes with 3D cluster support (p=0.02). CSF Dice similarity was 0.81A+-0.03.
                             Conclusion: VCAST is a volumetric annotation tool which reduces the time to obtain 3D segmentations in head CT while maintaining good overlap with a slice-based approach.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Map the current landscape of commercially available artificial intelligence (AI) software for radiology and review the availability of their scientific evidence. METHODS: We created an online overview of CE-marked AI software products for clinical radiology based on vendor-supplied product specifications (www.aiforradiology.com ). Characteristics such as modality, subspeciality, main task, regulatory information, deployment, and pricing model were retrieved. We conducted an extensive literature search on the available scientific evidence of these products. Articles were classified according to a hierarchical model of efficacy. RESULTS: The overview included 100 CE-marked AI products from 54 different vendors. For 64/100 products, there was no peer-reviewed evidence of its efficacy. We observed a large heterogeneity in deployment methods, pricing models, and regulatory classes. The evidence of the remaining 36/100 products comprised 237 papers that predominantly (65%) focused on diagnostic accuracy (efficacy level 2). From the 100 products, 18 had evidence that regarded level 3 or higher, validating the (potential) impact on diagnostic thinking, patient outcome, or costs. Half of the available evidence (116/237) were independent and not (co-)funded or (co-)authored by the vendor. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the commercial supply of AI software in radiology already holds 100 CE-marked products, we conclude that the sector is still in its infancy. For 64/100 products, peer-reviewed evidence on its efficacy is lacking. Only 18/100 AI products have demonstrated (potential) clinical impact. KEY POINTS: * Artificial intelligence in radiology is still in its infancy even though already 100 CE-marked AI products are commercially available. * Only 36 out of 100 products have peer-reviewed evidence of which most studies demonstrate lower levels of efficacy. * There is a wide variety in deployment strategies, pricing models, and CE marking class of AI products for radiology.},

  abstract = {Since the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology, the promise has been that it will improve health care and reduce costs. Has AI been able to fulfill that promise? We describe six clinical objectives that can be supported by AI: a more efficient workflow, shortened reading time, a reduction of dose and contrast agents, earlier detection of disease, improved diagnostic accuracy and more personalized diagnostics. We provide examples of use cases including the available scientific evidence for its impact based on a hierarchical model of efficacy. We conclude that the market is still maturing and little is known about the contribution of AI to clinical practice. More real-world monitoring of AI in clinical practice is expected to aid in determining the value of AI and making informed decisions on development, procurement and reimbursement.},

  abstract = {Objective: To investigate the temporal dynamics of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) by 3 consecutive assessments over a period of 9 years, distinguishing progression from regression.

                             Methods: Changes in SVD markers of 276 participants of the Radboud University Nijmegen Diffusion Tensor and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Cohort (RUN DMC) cohort were assessed at 3 time points over 9 years. We assessed white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume by semiautomatic segmentation and rated lacunes and microbleeds manually. We categorized baseline WMH severity as mild, moderate, or severe according to the modified Fazekas scale. We performed mixed-effects regression analysis including a quadratic term for increasing age.

                             Results: Mean WMH progression over 9 years was 4.7 mL (0.54 mL/y; interquartile range 0.95-5.5 mL), 20.3% of patients had incident lacunes (2.3%/y), and 18.9% had incident microbleeds (2.2%/y). WMH volume declined in 9.4% of the participants during the first follow-up interval, but only for 1 participant (0.4%) throughout the whole follow-up. Lacunes disappeared in 3.6% and microbleeds in 5.7% of the participants. WMH progression accelerated over time: including a quadratic term for increasing age during follow-up significantly improved the model (p < 0.001). SVD progression was predominantly seen in participants with moderate to severe WMH at baseline compared to those with mild WMH (odds ratio [OR] 35.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 15.8-80.0, p < 0.001 for WMH progression; OR 5.7, 95% CI 2.8-11.2, p < 0.001 for incident lacunes; and OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-5.9, p = 0.003 for incident microbleeds).

                             Conclusions: SVD progression is nonlinear, accelerating over time, and a highly dynamic process, with progression interrupted by reduction in some, in a population that on average shows progression.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that neuroimaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease can also regress over time. We investigated the cognitive consequences of regression of small vessel disease markers. Two hundred and seventy-six participants of the RUNDMC study underwent neuroimaging and cognitive assessments at three time-points over 8.7 years. We semi-automatically assessed white matter hyperintensities volumes and manually rated lacunes and microbleeds. We analysed differences in cognitive decline and accompanying brain atrophy between participants with regression, progression and stable small vessel disease by analysis of variance. Fifty-six participants (20.3%) showed regression of small vessel disease markers: 31 (11.2%) white matter hyperintensities regression, 10 (3.6%) vanishing lacunes and 27 (9.8%) vanishing microbleeds. Participants with regression showed a decline in overall cognition, memory, psychomotor speed and executive function similar to stable small vessel disease. Participants with small vessel disease progression showed more cognitive decline compared with stable small vessel disease (p < 0.001 for cognitive index and memory; p < 0.01 for executive function), although significance disappeared after adjusting for age and sex. Loss of total brain, gray matter and white matter volume did not differ between participants with small vessel disease regression and stable small vessel disease, while participants with small vessel disease progression showed more volume loss of total brain and gray matter compared to those with stable small vessel disease (p < 0.05), although significance disappeared after adjustments. Regression of small vessel disease markers was associated with similar cognitive decline compared to stable small vessel disease and did not accompany brain atrophy, suggesting that small vessel disease regression follows a relatively benign clinical course. Future studies are required to validate these findings and to assess the role of vascular risk factor control on small vessel disease regression and possible recovery of clinical symptoms. Our findings of comparable cognitive decline between participants with regression and stable small vessel disease might suggest that small vessel disease regression has a relative benign cognitive outcome.},

  abstract = {The reduction of false positive marks in breast mass CAD is an active area of research. Typically, the problem can be approached either by developing more discriminative features or by employing difierent classifier designs. Usually one intends to find an optimal combination of classifier configuration and small number of features to ensure high classification performance and a robust model with good generalization capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the potential benefit of relying on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for the detection of masses. The evaluation is based on a 10-fold cross validation over a large database of screenfilm mammograms (10397 images). The purpose of this study is twofold: first, we assess the SVM performance compared to neural networks (NNet), k-nearest neighbor classification (k-NN) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Second, we study the classifiers' performances when using a set of 30 and a set of 73 region-based features. The CAD performance is quantified by the mean sensitivity in 0.05 to 1 false positives per exam on the free-response receiver operating characteristic curve. The best mean exam sensitivities found were 0.545, 0.636, 0.648, 0.675 for LDA, k-NN, NNet and SVM. K-NN and NNet proved to be stable against variation of the featuresets. Conversely, LDA and SVM exhibited an increase in performance when adding more features. It is concluded that with an SVM a more pronounced reduction of false positives is possible, given that a large number of cases and features are available.},

Evaluating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), feature selection raised AUC from 0.68, 0.69 and 0.72 for MG, MRI and MM to 0.76, 0.73 and 0.81 with a significant improvement for MM (P=0.018). Multimodal classification offered increased performance compared to MG and MRI (P=0.181 and P=0.087). In conclusion, unimodal feature selection significantly increased multimodal classification performance and can provide a useful tool for generating joint CADx scores in the multimodal setting.},

Typically, the problem can be approached either by developing more discriminative features or by employing different classifier designs. In this paper, the usage of support vector machine (SVM) classification for FP reduction in CADe is investigated, presenting a systematic quantitative evaluation against neural networks, k-nearest neighbor classification, linear discriminant analysis and random forests. A large database of 2516 film mammography examinations and 73 input features was used to train the classifiers and evaluate for their performance on correctly diagnosed exams as well as false negatives. Further, classifier robustness was investigated using varying training data and feature sets as input. The evaluation was based on the mean exam sensitivity in 0.05-1 FPs on normals on the free-response receiver operating characteristic curve (FROC), incorporated into a tenfold cross validation framework. It was found that SVM classification using a Gaussian kernel offered significantly increased detection performance (P = 0.0002) compared to the reference methods. Varying training data and input features, SVMs showed improved exploitation of large feature sets. It is concluded that with the SVM-based CADe a significant reduction of FPs is possible outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches for breast mass CADe.},

  abstract = {The amount of calcifications in the coronary arteries is a powerful and independent predictor of cardiovascular events and is used to identify subjects at high risk who might benefit from preventive treatment. Routine quantification of coronary calcium scores can complement screening programs using low-dose chest CT, such as lung cancer screening. We present a system for automatic coronary calcium scoring based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

                             The system uses three independently trained CNNs to estimate a bounding box around the heart. In this region of interest, connected components above 130 HU are considered candidates for coronary artery calcifications. To separate them from other high intensity lesions, classification of all extracted voxels is performed by feeding two-dimensional 50 mm x 50 mm patches from three orthogonal planes into three concurrent CNNs. The networks consist of three convolutional layers and one fully-connected layer with 256 neurons.

                             In the experiments, 1028 non-contrast-enhanced and non-ECG-triggered low-dose chest CT scans were used. The network was trained on 797 scans. In the remaining 231 test scans, the method detected on average 194.3 mm3 of 199.8 mm3 coronary calcifications per scan (sensitivity 97.2%) with an average false-positive volume of 10.3 mm3. Subjects were assigned to one of five standard cardiovascular risk categories based on the Agatston score. Accuracy of risk category assignment was 84.4% with a linearly weighted kappa of 0.89.

                             The proposed system can perform automatic coronary artery calcium scoring to identify subjects undergoing low-dose chest CT screening who are at risk of cardiovascular events with high accuracy.},

  abstract = {Heavy smokers undergoing screening with low-dose chest CT are affected by cardiovascular disease as much as by lung cancer. Low-dose chest CT scans acquired in screening enable quantification of atherosclerotic calcifications and thus enable identification of subjects at increased cardiovascular risk. This paper presents a method for automatic detection of coronary artery, thoracic aorta and cardiac valve calcifications in low-dose chest CT using two consecutive convolutional neural networks. The first network identifies and labels potential calcifications according to their anatomical location and the second network identifies true calcifications among the detected candidates. This method was trained and evaluated on a set of 1744 CT scans from the National Lung Screening Trial. To determine whether any reconstruction or only images reconstructed with soft tissue filters can be used for calcification detection, we evaluated the method on soft and medium/sharp filter reconstructions separately. On soft filter reconstructions, the method achieved F1 scores of 0.89, 0.89, 0.67, and 0.55 for coronary artery, thoracic aorta, aortic valve and mitral valve calcifications, respectively. On sharp filter reconstructions, the F1 scores were 0.84, 0.81, 0.64, and 0.66, respectively. Linearly weighted kappa coefficients for risk category assignment based on per subject coronary artery calcium were 0.91 and 0.90 for soft and sharp filter reconstructions, respectively. These results demonstrate that the presented method enables reliable automatic cardiovascular risk assessment in all low-dose chest CT scans acquired for lung cancer screening.},

  abstract = {Segmentation and labeling of the vertebrae in CT images are important steps for automatic analysis of the spine. This paper presents an automatic method based on iterative convolutional neural networks. These utilize the inherent order of the vertebral column to simplify the detection problem, so that the network can be trained with as little as ten manual reference segmentations. Vertebrae are identified and segmented individually in sequential order, first in low-resolution images that enable the analysis of context information, and afterwards in the original high-resolution images to obtain a fine segmentation. The method was trained and evaluated with 15 spine CT scans from the MICCAI CSI 2014 workshop challenge. These scans cover the whole thoracic and lumbar part of the spine of healthy young adults. In contrast to a non-iterative convolutional neural network, the proposed method correctly identified all vertebrae. Our method achieved a mean Dice coefficient of 0.948 and a mean surface distance of 0.29 mm and thus outperforms the best method that participated in the original challenge.},

  abstract = {Precise segmentation of the vertebrae is often required for automatic detection of vertebral abnormalities. This especially enables incidental detection of abnormalities such as compression fractures in images that were acquired for other diagnostic purposes. While many CT and MR scans of the chest and abdomen cover a section of the spine, they often do not cover the entire spine. Additionally, the first and last visible vertebrae are likely only partially included in such scans. In this paper, we therefore approach vertebra segmentation as an instance segmentation problem. A fully convolutional neural network is combined with an instance memory that retains information about already segmented vertebrae. This network iteratively analyzes image patches, using the instance memory to search for and segment the first not yet segmented vertebra. At the same time, each vertebra is classified as completely or partially visible, so that partially visible vertebrae can be excluded from further analyses. We evaluated this method on spine CT scans from a vertebra segmentation challenge and on low-dose chest CT scans. The method achieved an average Dice score of 95.8% and 92.1%, respectively, and a mean absolute surface distance of 0.194 mm and 0.344 mm.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate sex differences in the prevalence, extent, and association of coronary artery calcium (CAC) and thoracic aorta calcium (TAC) scores with cardiovascular mortality in a population eligible for lung screening. CAC and TAC scores derived from chest computed tomography (CT) might be useful biomarkers for individualized cardiovascular disease prevention and could be especially relevant in high-risk populations such as heavy smokers. Therefore, it is important to know the prevalence of arterial calcifications in male and female heavy smokers, and if there are differences in the predictive value calcifications carry. We performed a nested case-control study with 5,718 participants of the CT arm of the NLST (National Lung Screening Trial). Prevalence and extent of CAC and TAC were resampled to the full cohort to provide unbiased estimates of the typical calcium burden of male and female heavy smokers. Weighted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess differences in the association of CAC and TAC scores with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. CAC was substantially more common and more severe in men (prevalence: 81% vs. 60%; median volume: 104 mm3 vs.12 mm3). Women had CAC comparable to that of men who were 10 years younger. TAC was equally common in men and women, with a tendency to be more pronounced in women (prevalence: 92% vs. 93%; median volume: 388 mm3 vs. 404 mm3). Both types of calcification were associated with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. TAC scores improved the prediction of coronary heart disease mortality over CAC in men, but not in women. In both sexes, TAC, but not CAC, was associated with cardiovascular mortality other than coronary heart disease. CAC develops later in women, whereas TAC develops equally in both sexes. CAC is strongly associated with coronary heart disease, whereas TAC is especially associated with extracardiac vascular mortality in either sex.},

  abstract = {Precise segmentation and anatomical identification of the vertebrae provides the basis for automatic analysis of the spine, such as detection of vertebral compression fractures or other abnormalities. Most dedicated spine CT and MR scans as well as scans of the chest, abdomen or neck cover only part of the spine. Segmentation and identification should therefore not rely on the visibility of certain vertebrae or a certain number of vertebrae. We propose an iterative instance segmentation approach that uses a fully convolutional neural network to segment and label vertebrae one after the other, independently of the number of visible vertebrae. This instance-by-instance segmentation is enabled by combining the network with a memory component that retains information about already segmented vertebrae. The network iteratively analyzes image patches, using information from both image and memory to search for the next vertebra. To efficiently traverse the image, we include the prior knowledge that the vertebrae are always located next to each other, which is used to follow the vertebral column. The network concurrently performs multiple tasks, which are segmentation of a vertebra, regression of its anatomical label and prediction whether the vertebra is completely visible in the image, which allows to exclude incompletely visible vertebrae from further analyses. The predicted anatomical labels of the individual vertebrae are additionally refined with a maximum likelihood approach, choosing the overall most likely labeling if all detected vertebrae are taken into account. This method was evaluated with five diverse datasets, including multiple modalities (CT and MR), various fields of view and coverages of different sections of the spine, and a particularly challenging set of low-dose chest CT scans. For vertebra segmentation, the average Dice score was 94.9 +- 2.1% with an average absolute symmetric surface distance of 0.2 +- 10.1mm. The anatomical identification had an accuracy of 93 %, corresponding to a single case with mislabeled vertebrae. Vertebrae were classified as completely or incompletely visible with an accuracy of 97 %. The proposed iterative segmentation method compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods and is fast, flexible and generalizable.},

  title = {Machine Learning based quantification of extrapulmonary diseases in chest CT},
  year = {2019},
  url = {https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/380319},
  abstract = {In several countries, including the US and China, and likely soon also in Europe, heavy cigarette smokers are regularly invited for a computed tomography (CT) scan of their lungs (chest CT). This scan can help detect lung cancer in an early stage, when treatment is more effective. Heavy smokers often also have other chronic diseases, of which some can also be detected on these scans, or of which the severity can be measured in these scans. The research in this thesis focuses on automatic analysis of lung cancer screening chest CT scans to measure the severity of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Automatic image analysis makes it possible to include these assessments into the screening workflow without requiring additional reading time of radiologists or image analysts. The image analysis methods that we developed are based on deep convolutional neural networks, a form of machine learning. We developed a method that detects calcifications of the coronary arteries, the aorta and the heart valves. The amount of calcification of these arteries is an indicator of the severity of cardiovascular disease and the risk to have a cardiovascular event, such as heart attack or stroke. We also applied this method to a large dataset from a US screening study to investigate differences between men and women. For osteoporosis analysis, we developed a method that finds the vertebrae in the image and another method that partitions the vertebrae. Together, this allows for automatic measurement of, e.g., the density or size of the vertebral bodies.},

  abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread across the globe with alarming speed, morbidity, and mortality. Immediate triage of patients with chest infections suspected to be caused by COVID-19 using chest CT may be of assistance when results from definitive viral testing are delayed. Purpose: To develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) system to score the likelihood and extent of pulmonary COVID-19 on chest CT scans using the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) and CT severity scoring systems. Materials and Methods: The CO-RADS AI system consists of three deep-learning algorithms that automatically segment the five pulmonary lobes, assign a CO-RADS score for the suspicion of COVID-19, and assign a CT severity score for the degree of parenchymal involvement per lobe. This study retrospectively included patients who underwent a nonenhanced chest CT examination because of clinical suspicion of COVID-19 at two medical centers. The system was trained, validated, and tested with data from one of the centers. Data from the second center served as an external test set. Diagnostic performance and agreement with scores assigned by eight independent observers were measured using receiver operating characteristic analysis, linearly weighted k values, and classification accuracy. Results: A total of 105 patients (mean age, 62 years +- 16 [standard deviation]; 61 men) and 262 patients (mean age, 64 years +- 16; 154 men) were evaluated in the internal and external test sets, respectively. The system discriminated between patients with COVID-19 and those without COVID-19, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.98) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.93), for the internal and external test sets, respectively. Agreement with the eight human observers was moderate to substantial, with mean linearly weighted k values of 0.60 +- 0.01 for CO-RADS scores and 0.54 +- 0.01 for CT severity scores. Conclusion: With high diagnostic performance, the CO-RADS AI system correctly identified patients with COVID-19 using chest CT scans and assigned standardized CO-RADS and CT severity scores that demonstrated good agreement with findings from eight independent observers and generalized well to external data.},

                             :
                             A tool for grading micro-aneurysms and the Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ) in Fluorescein Angiography (FA) and OCT Angiography (OCTA) has been developed. With this tool the user can compare visibility and grade micro-aneurysms by displaying early FA, late FA and inner, intermediate and outer OCTA images in a synchronized view.

                             Methods
                             :
                             The user can register the images in two steps by clicking on corresponding landmarks: early and late FA should be registered, as well as early FA to OCTA. A least-squares approximation to the affine transform that best matches the annotated point sets is calculated. Visual feedback is available during this stage by blending the images that need to be registered.
                             Once the images are registered, a synchronized cursor helps the user in finding and comparing micro-aneurysms in all five images. The FAZ, for which the area is automatically calculated, can be drawn onto each image as well.

                             Results
                             :

                             Early and late FA and OCTA images, segmented into an inner, intermediate and outer layer, have been acquired for 31 eyes of 24 patients with Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). In every set of images, enough landmarks could be found for successful registration. The affine transform was sufficiently accurate to compare micro-aneurysms in the different images. The tool has been used for grading visibility and leakage of 567 micro-aneurysms. The FAZ could be delineated accurately in each image except the late FA where it was not visible.

                             Conclusion
                             :
                             We developed a tool that can help researchers in comparing properties of FA and OCTA images, by registration of 5 different images (early and late FA, inner, intermediate and outer OCTA). The tool has been used for grading micro-aneurysms and delineating the FAZ for patients with DME.},

  abstract = {The fovea is an important clinical landmark that is used as a reference for assessing various quantitative measures, such as central retinal thickness or drusen count. In this paper we propose a novel method for automatic detection of the foveal center in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans. Although the clinician will generally aim to center the OCT scan on the fovea, post-acquisition image processing will give a more accurate estimate of the true location of the foveal center. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on a set of 781 OCT scans that classifies each pixel in the OCT B-scan with a probability of belonging to the fovea. Dilated convolutions were used to obtain a large receptive field, while maintaining pixel-level accuracy. In order to train the network more effectively, negative patches were sampled selectively after each epoch. After CNN classification of the entire OCT volume, the predicted foveal center was chosen as the voxel with maximum output probability, after applying an optimized three-dimensional Gaussian blurring. We evaluate the performance of our method on a data set of 99 OCT scans presenting different stages of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). The fovea was correctly detected in 96.9% of the cases, with a mean distance error of 73 +- 112 micro meter. This result was comparable to the performance of a second human observer who obtained a mean distance error of 69 +- 94 micro meter. Experiments showed that the proposed method is accurate and robust even in retinas heavily affected by pathology.},

  abstract = {Purpose : To aautomatically detect the foveal center in optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans in order to obtain an accurate and reliable reference for the assessment of various structural biomarkers, even in the presence of large abnormalities and across different scanning protocols.

                             Methods : 1784 OCT scans were used for the development of the proposed automatic method: 1744 scans from the European Genetic Database (EUGENDA) acquired with a Heidelberg Spectralis HRA+OCT 1 scanner and 40 scans from a publicly available dataset [1] acquired with a Bioptigen scanner. Two independent sets, with different levels of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) were drawn from the same databases for evaluation: 100 scans from EUGENDA (Set A, 25 control patients and 25 for each of the AMD severity levels early, intermediate and advanced) and 100 scans from [1] (Set B, 50 control, 50 AMD).
                             A fully convolutional neural network based on stacked layers of dilated convolutions was trained to classify each pixel in a B-scan by assigning a probability of belonging to the fovea. The network was applied to every B-scan in the OCT volume, and the final foveal center was defined as the pixel with maximum assigned probability. An initial network was trained on the 1744 training scans from EUGENDA and optimized with the 40 training scans acquired with the Bioptigen scanner, to specialize for different levels of noise and contrast.

                             For all scans manual annotations were available as reference for evaluation. The foveal center was considered correctly identified if the distance between the prediction and the reference was less than the foveal radius, i.e. 750 mm.

                             Results : The foveal center was correctly detected in 95 OCT scans in Set A (24 control, 24 early, 25 intermediate, 22 advanced). The mean distance error was 63.7 mm with 81 detections inside a radius of 175 mm (the foveola) and 70 inside a radius of 75 mm (the umbo). In Set B, the foveal center was correctly identified in 96 OCT scans (49 control, 47 AMD). The mean distance error was 88.6 mm with 82 detections inside the foveola and 61 inside the umbo.

                             Conclusions : The proposed automatic method performed accurately for both healthy retinas and retinas affected by AMD. The method can be applied successfully to scans from different vendors, thus providing a reliable reference location for the assessment of structural biomarkers in OCT.},

  title = {Prediction of areas at risk of developing geographic atrophy in color fundus images using deep learning},
  abstract = {Purpose:
                             Exact quantification of areas of geographic atrophy (GA) can provide an important anatomical endpoint for treatment trials. The prediction of areas where GA may develop can provide valuable personalized prognosis and help in the development of targeted treatments to prevent progression and further vision loss. In this work, we present a model based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts the areas of GA within 5 years from baseline using color fundus (CF) images.

                             Methods:
                             Areas of GA were delineated by 4 to 5 experienced graders in consensus in 377 CF images (252 eyes) collected from the Rotterdam Study and the Blue Mountains Eye Study. Graders made use of multimodal and follow up images when available, using our EyeNED annotation workstation. We identified 84 pairs of images (baseline and follow-up) of the same eye that were acquired with an interval of approximately 5 years. Image registration was performed by identifying corresponding landmarks between the images, allowing to project the delineated GA of the follow-up image onto the baseline image.
                             Next, a fully automatic segmentation model, based on a deep CNN, was developed. The CNN was trained to simultaneously segment the current GA area and the area at risk of developing GA, using only the baseline image as input. A five-fold cross-validation was performed to validate the prediction performance.

                             Results:
                             The model achieved an average dice coefficient of 0.63 for segmentation of areas at risk of developing GA in the 84 images. The intraclass correlation coefficient between the GA area defined by the consensus grading of the follow-up image and the automatically predicted area based on the baseline image was 0.54.

                             Conclusions:
                             We present a model based on a deep CNN that is capable of identifying areas where GA may develop from CF images. The proposed approach constitutes a step towards personalized prognosis and possible treatment decisions. Furthermore, the model may be used for automatic discovery of new predictive biomarkers for development and growth rate of GA, and may help to automatically identify individuals at risk of developing GA.},

                            DESIGN:
                            Prospective, multicenter, natural history study with up to 15 years of follow-up.

                            PARTICIPANTS:
                            Four hundred nine CFIs of 238 eyes with GA from the Rotterdam Study (RS) and Blue Mountain Eye Study (BMES) for model development, and 3589 CFIs of 376 eyes from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) for analysis of GA growth rate.

                            METHODS:
                            Deep learning model based on an ensemble of encoder-decoder architectures was implemented and optimized for the segmentation of GA in CFIs. Four experienced graders delineated, in consensus, GA in CFIs from the RS and BMES. These manual delineations were used to evaluate the segmentation model using 5-fold cross-validation. The model was applied further to CFIs from the AREDS to study the growth rate of GA. Linear regression analysis was used to study associations between structural biomarkers at baseline and the GA growth rate. A general estimate of the progression of GA area over time was made by combining growth rates of all eyes with GA from the AREDS set.

                            MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
                            Automatically segmented GA and GA growth rate.

                            RESULTS:
                            The model obtained an average Dice coefficient of 0.72+-0.26 on the BMES and RS set while comparing the automatically segmented GA area with the graders' manual delineations. An intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.83 was reached between the automatically estimated GA area and the graders' consensus measures. Nine automatically calculated structural biomarkers (area, filled area, convex area, convex solidity, eccentricity, roundness, foveal involvement, perimeter, and circularity) were significantly associated with growth rate. Combining all growth rates indicated that GA area grows quadratically up to an area of approximately 12 mm2, after which growth rate stabilizes or decreases.

                            CONCLUSIONS:
                            The deep learning model allowed for fully automatic and robust segmentation of GA on CFIs. These segmentations can be used to extract structural characteristics of GA that predict its growth rate.},

  title = {Achieving expert level performance in quantifying 13 distinctive features of neovascular age-related macular degeneration on optical coherence tomography},
  abstract = {Purpose:
    				To develop and validate an automatic model for volumetric quantification of the 13 most common abnormalities associated with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) on optical coherence tomography (OCT).
    				Setting:
    				Clinical data and associated imaging were collected from five UK secondary care providers between February 2002 and September 2017. We identified 680 treatment-naive patients with no recent cataract surgery, at least one anti-VEGF injection, a diagnosis of nAMD, and associated OCT imaging (Topcon, Tokyo, Japan).
    				Methods:
    				A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to produce a volumetric segmentation of 13 retinal abnormalities. The CNN architecture was based on a deep encoder-decoder structure that combines information from adjacent B-scans. The model was trained on 2,712 B-scans from 307 OCT volumes, with manual labels provided at a voxel-level for all abnormalities by eight graders. Abnormalities that were found in over 80 B-scans were modelled. The performance of the model and graders was assessed on an independent set of 112 B-scans from 112 OCT-volumes of nAMD cases, for which four graders independently provided annotations. To create a reference standard, the outputs of three graders were combined and defined as voxels where at least two out of three agreed. The graders' accuracy was calculated using each grader, in turn, as an observer. The Dice similarity metric was used to compare overlap, calculated per A-scan or per voxel where appropriate. Free-response receiver operator characteristic (FROC) analysis was used for the detection of small abnormalities. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to measure agreement on area or volume measures, with the reference area or volume defined as the average of the three graders.
    				Results:
    				Included abnormalities were: intraretinal fluid (IRF), subretinal fluid (SRF), pigment epithelial detachment (PED), subretinal hyperreflective material (SHRM), fibrosis, drusen and drusenoid PED, epiretinal membrane (ERM), outer plexiform layer (OPL) descent, ellipsoid loss, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) loss or attenuation, hyper-transmission, hyperreflective dots and subretinal drusenoid deposits - reticular pseudodrusen (SDD - RPD). For OPL-descent and fibrosis there were insufficient examples in the test set for a reliable performance estimate.For the other features, the model obtained an average Dice score of 0.63 +- 0.15 (median 0.64), compared to 0.61 +- 0.17 (median 0.60) for the observers. The average ICC for the model was 0.66 +- 0.22 (median 0.69), compared to 0.62 +- 0.21 (median 0.55) for the observers. For individual features, differences between model and observer Dice score were within a 95% confidence interval for all features except ellipsoid loss, where model performance was slightly better (p=0.03). Regarding ICC, model performance was slightly better for IRF (p=0.04) and ellipsoid loss (p=0.006), slightly worse for drusen and drusenoid PED (p=0.03), and within the 95% confidence interval for other features. For hyperreflective dots and SDD-RPD, FROC analysis revealed that the model performed at similar sensitivity per false positives as the observers.
    				Conclusions:
    				We present a deep-learning based model that provides accurate volumetric quantification of a comprehensive set of relevant pathological components of nAMD. There was relatively large variability in grader agreement between abnormalities. Nevertheless, model performance was comparable to, and in many cases exceeded, human performance, both in terms of overlap and quantification. The model generates a precise, quantitative morphological signature of the retinal pathology that can facilitate the development of prediction models for treatment response and planning of personalized treatment intervals, as well as further research into structure/function correlation. In clinical care it can facilitate structured reporting, reducing subjectivity in clinicians' assessments and enabling implementation of refined treatment guidelines.The presented model accelerates interpretation of OCT volumes and surpasses manual reading, both in terms of attainable level of extracted information and consistency. This can potentially lead to a reduction of costs in interpretation of clinical trials and improve personalized clinical care.},

Specifically, the system should be accurate for classes seen during training while providing calibrated estimates of uncertainty for abnormalities and unseen classes. To efficiently estimate predictive uncertainty, we propose the use of multi-head CNNs (M-heads). We compare its performance to related and more prevalent approaches, such as deep ensembles, on the task of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. To this end, we evaluate models trained to discriminate normal lymph node tissue from breast cancer metastases, on lymph nodes containing lymphoma. We show the ability to discriminate between in-distribution lymph node tissue and lymphoma by evaluating the AUROC based on the uncertainty signal. Here, the best performing multi-head CNN (91.7) outperforms both Monte Carlo dropout (88.3) and deep ensembles (86.8). Furthermore, we show that the meta-loss function of M-heads improves OOD detection in terms of AUROC.},

  title = {T1 Quantification: Variable Flip Angle Method vs Use of Reference Phantom},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {{PURPOSE} For standardized interpretation of DCEMRI curves, calculation of contrast agent (CA) concentration from signal intensity over time is desired. Accurate measurement of tissue T1 before and after CA administration is thus necessary. Current T1 measurement methods are time-consuming. We propose the use of the ?reference tissue? method for fast T1 measurements concurrent with DCEMRI data acquisition, but with use of a reference phantom. {METHOD AND MATERIALS} The ?reference tissue? method is based on the approximation that in T1-weighted gradient echo images, signal intensity is proportional to 1/T1 ? thus signal intensity can be referenced to a tissue or a phantom with a known T1. We compared this method to the ?variable flip angle? method, most commonly used in clinical practice. We compared the ?reference tissue? method (TR/TE = 25/1.1 ms, a=40?) to the ?variable flip angle? method (TR/TE = 25/1.1 ms, a=3/5/10/15/20/25/30/35/40?), using the Eurospin T05 phantom, in which 10 out of 18 vials containing agar with varying concentrations of Gd-DTPA (T1 range: 281 ? 1384 ms) were used. {RESULTS} With the ?reference tissue? method, using 9 tubes successively as a reference for the remaining tube, the average error in the estimation of T1 was 8.5%, with a standard deviation of 6.1%, and was random. Using the ?variable flip angle? method, the average error was 5.7 % with a standard deviation of 3.8%. Using a two-sided Student?s t-test we found no statistically significant differences in the performance of the two methods (p-value = 0.52). {CONCLUSION} As DCEMRI imaging is done in a heavily T1-weighted regime, the ?reference tissue? method can be used to concurrently measure T1, and quantify CA concentration. Use of an agar phantom will require a correction for lower proton density in biological tissue. Proton density can be measured prior to CA administration, or tabulated values can be used. We demonstrated the feasibility of fast T1 measurements using a reference phantom, providing T1 maps without additional scanning time. This will allow quantification of the CA concentration throughout the DCEMRI scan, which cannot be achieved using the current clinical method. {CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION} The use of a reference phantom for determining T1 can lead to a drastic reduction in scanning time and thus patient discomfort when compared to a regular clinical ?variable flip angle? scan.},

This method was compared, in an observer study, to a previously published method that simulates pulmonary nodules as perfectly spherical objects. Results show that it is hard for human observers to distinguish real and simulated nodules when using templates (AUC-values do not significantly differ from .5, p > .05 for all observers). The method that produced spherical nodules performed slightly worse (AUC of one observer differs significantly from .5, p = .011). Simulation of diffuse infiltrates is challenging but also feasible (AUC = 0.67 for one observer).},

  title = {Pharmacokinetic modeling in breast cancer MRI},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {Breast cancer is a disease which impacts the lives of thousands of people. In the entire world over half a million people die due to breast cancer every year, mostly women. However, when breast cancer is detected in the early stages of disease ?ve-year-survival rate approaches 100%. So, it is very important to detect breast cancer as early as possible. That is why in most of modern Western society screening programs for breast cancer have been developed. Most of these screening programs focus on x-ray mammography. However, women who have an increased risk to get breast cancer these screening programs are not adequate. These women usually develop breast cancer at a younger age and x-ray mammography for those women has a low sensitivity. For these cases, and inconclusive ?ndings in x-ray mammography in other women, dynamic contrast enhance (DCE) MRI is used. In DCE MRI a contrast agent is used which takes advantage of the fact that tumor vasculature is leaky and sloppy, thus the contrast agent tends to accumulate in the tumor, leading to increased signal intensity in T1-weighted images. Due to the fact that we have a time range of images it is possible to look at kinetic behavior. However, as kinetic curves have a large inter and intra patient variability and variability depending on the imaging site the analysis of these curves is not straightforward. Pharmacokinetic modeling could be an answer to those problems as it can be used to obtain lesion-speci?c physiological parameters. To use pharmacokinetic modeling however we need high temporal resolution data, which is not readily available. The University of Chicago Medical Center obtained several high temporal resolution data sets for the initial part of the kinetic enhancement curve in addition to the regular low temporal clinical scans. These data sets were the basis for this research. When analyzing such data several factors play an important role. The ?rst of these being the extraction of the signal-vs.-time curves from the data sets. In this report we used a small graphical user interface to extract the data. The low and high temporal resolution images were obtained in different orientations, which was a problem we also needed to solve. The second step after extraction of the signal-vs.-time-curves was the conversion of the signal intensity to contrast agent concentration. In literature there were several methods that were used to accomplish this, but all were based on the use of a gradient recalled echo signal model. We ?rst investigated the assumption that we can neglect T2* effects, which we concluded was allowed. To estimate concentration the tissue T1 at time 0 has to been known. As we had no additional T1 measurements, we used a reference tissue approach to estimate T1. We investigated if the simpli?cations often used in this method were allowed and we concluded that it was better to use the full model. The last part of the conversion to concentration is the estimation of uncertainty in the concentration curves, which in itself contains several uncertainties. We derived an algebraic expression for these uncertainties using a Taylor expansion of concentration uncertainty. On average the uncertainty levels are around 10% of the concentration. The third step was choosing a pharmacokinetic model, we inspected a total of four models, the standard and extended Tofts models, the shutter speed model and the Brix model. We ?rst assessed the ability of each model to ?nd correct minima using a forward-backward simulation approach. We then simulated data that has the same temporal and uncertainty characteristics as real clinical data and used the same forward-backward approach to estimate model performance. We concluded that for data with those speci?c characteristics only the standard Tofts model performed adequately. After that we started investigating the data requirements for all models and we could see that for all models except the standard Tofts model data requirements on especially temporal resolution are high. Lastly we did an investigation in the errors introduced by assuming that the underlying physiological processes are more simplistic, which is what we do when we use the standard Tofts model. The fourth step was ?nding the arterial input function, which is used as an input for the pharmacokinetic model. In literature there are several methods, we discussed three: the use of a standardized input function (population averaged or mathematical), the use of a single reference tissue approach and the use of a multiple refernce tissue approach. We found that errors caused by using a population averaged input function can be quite large as deviations from the true local input functions are seen directly in the pharmacokinetic parameters. The single reference tissue approach is another way to estimate the input function. We found that when we know the exact pharmacokinetic parameters of the reference tissue the errors are considerably lower than in the use of a standardized AIF. When pharmacokinetic parameters of the reference tissue are wrong however we can still induce large errors in parameter estimates. The third option was the use of a multiple reference tissue approach, which gave the best results. If multiple reference tissue are available within the data set this option should be used. The last step is to put together the pieces from the previous steps and use that to analyze the clinical data. We were able to use 14 patient data sets. Although a small number, we were able to see that there seems to be a relation between malignancy and Ktrans values. Benign tissues seemed to have lower Ktrans values when compared to malignant tissues. Another question was if we were able to cluster different cancer types according to pharmacokinetic parameters, but we have too little data to support that claim.},

  abstract = {Development of CAD systems for detection of prostate cancer has been a recent topic of research. A multi-stage computer aided detection scheme is proposed to help reduce perception and oversight errors in multi-parametric prostate cancer screening MRI. In addition, important features for development of computer aided detection systems for prostate cancer screening MRI are identified. A fast, robust prostate segmentation routine is used to segment the prostate, based on coupled appearance and anatomy models. Subsequently a voxel classification is performed using a support vector machine to compute an abnormality likelihood map of the prostate. This classification step is based on quantitative voxel features like the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and pharmacokinetic parameters. Local maxima in the likelihood map are found using a local maxima detector, after which regions around the local maxima are segmented. Region features are computed to represent statistical properties of the voxel features within the regions. Region classification is performed using these features, which results in a likelihood of abnormality per region. Performance was validated using a 188 patient dataset in a leave-one-patient-out manner. Ground truth was annotated by two expert radiologists. The results were evaluated using FROC analysis. The FROC curves show that inclusion of ADC and pharmacokinetic parameter features increases the performance of an automatic detection system. In addition it shows the potential of such an automated system in aiding radiologists diagnosing prostate MR, obtaining a sensitivity of respectively 74.7\% and 83.4\% at 7 and 9 false positives per patient.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {{PURPOSE} Interpretation of multi-parametric MRI findings in the peripheral zone (PZ) or the transition zone (TZ) of the prostate is different. Therefore, this study investigates the performance of zone-specific computer-aided detection (CAD) as opposed to whole-prostate CAD. {METHOD AND MATERIALS} 117 consecutive prostate MRI?s from 2009 were extracted from our database. 71/117 MRI?s showed no malignant findings, 26/117 patients had a PZ tumor, 20/117 a TZ tumor. The MRI?s were acquired on a 3T MR scanner (Siemens Trio Tim, Erlangen, Germany) and included T2-weighted images (T2WI), dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), and diffusion-weighted images (DWI). From DCE-MRI and DWI pharmacokinetic parameters (PK) and ADC maps were calculated respectively. Lesion locations were indicated by an expert radiologist. Histology was obtained using MR-guided biopsy or prostatectomy. A two-stage classification strategy was used. The prostate was segmented using an atlas based method including PZ and TZ. First stage voxel classification resulted in a likelihood map, in which local maxima were detected. Then, a region was segmented for each local maximum. Second stage classification resulted in a malignancy likelihood per region. Voxel features used were the T2WI intensities, PK and ADC values and blob detection values for T2WI, ADC and PK images. For the second stage 25th- and 75th-percentiles within the segmented regions were calculated for all voxel features including the initial likelihood map. Classification in both stages was performed using a whole-prostate classifier or two separate zone-specific classifiers. The first stage used linear discriminant classifiers, the second stage support vector machine classifiers. Validation was performed in a leave-one-patient-out manner. FROC calculation and statistical analysis were performed using the JAFROC software package. The figure-of-merit (FOM) used is the area under the alternative FROC (AFROC) curve. {RESULTS} Zone-specific CAD was significantly better than whole-prostate CAD (FOM 0.63 vs. 0.48, p < 0.05). At 0.1, 1.0 and 3.0 false positives per patient the sensitivity of the zone-specific system was 0.23, 0.5 and 0.87 compared to 0.05, 0.22 and 0.47. {CONCLUSION} A zone-specific CAD system has significantly higher performance than a whole-prostate CAD system. {CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION} CAD can help the radiologist read prostate MRI and might reduce oversight and perception errors in both PZ and TZ.},

  abstract = {MRI has shown to have great potential in prostate cancer localization and grading, but interpreting those exams requires expertise that is not widely available. Therefore, CAD applications are being developed to aid radiologists in detecting prostate cancer. Existing CAD applications focus on the prostate as a whole. However, in clinical practice transition zone cancer and peripheral zone cancer are considered to have different appearances. In this paper we present zone-specific CAD, in addition to an atlas based segmentation technique which includes zonal segmentation. Our CAD system consists of a detection and a classification stage. Prior to the detection stage the prostate is segmented into two zones. After segmentation features are extracted. Subsequently a likelihood map is generated on which local maxima detection is performed. For each local maximum a region is segmented. In the classification stage additional shape features are calculated, after which the regions are classified. Validation was performed on 288 data sets with MR-guided biopsy results as ground truth. Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristic (FROC) analysis was used for statistical evaluation. The difference between whole-prostate and zone-specific CAD was assessed using the difference between the FROCs. Our results show that evaluating the two zones separately results in an increase in performance compared to whole-prostate CAD. The FROC curves at .1, 1 and 3 false positives have a sensitivity of 0.0, 0.55 and 0.72 for whole-prostate and 0.08, 0.57 and 0.80 for zone-specific CAD. The FROC curve of the zone-specific CAD also showed significantly better performance overall (p < 0.05).},

It is evaluated against a multi-parametric multi-atlas based method using 48 multi-parametric MRI studies. Three observers are used to assess inter-observer variability and we compare our results against the state of the art from literature. Results show a mean Dice coefficient of 0.89 +/- 0.03 for the central gland and 0.75 +/- 0.07 for the peripheral zone, compared to 0.87 +/-0.04 and 0.76 +/- 0.06 in literature. Summarizing, a pattern recognition approach incorporating anatomy, intensity and texture has been shown to give good results in zonal segmentation of the prostate.},

  abstract = {Purpose:To determine the interpatient variability of prostate peripheral zone (PZ) apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and its effect on the assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness.Materials and Methods:The requirement for institutional review board approval was waived. Intra- and interpatient variation of PZ ADCs was determined by means of repeated measurements of normal ADCs at three magnetic resonance (MR) examinations in a retrospective cohort of 10 consecutive patients who had high prostate-specific antigen levels and negative findings at transrectal ultrasonographically-guided biopsy. In these patients, no signs of PZ cancer were found at all three MR imaging sessions. The effect of interpatient variation on the assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness was examined in a second retrospective cohort of 51 patients with PZ prostate cancer. Whole-mount step-section pathologic evaluation served as reference standard for placement of regions of interest on tumors and normal PZ. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to determine the significance of the interpatient variations in ADCs. Linear logistic regression was used to assess whether incorporating normal PZ ADCs improves the prediction of cancer aggressiveness.Results:Analysis of variance revealed that interpatient variability (1.2-2.0 A-A?A 1/2  10(-3) mm(2)/sec) was significantly larger than measurement variability (0.068 A-A?A 1/2  10(-3) mm(2)/sec A-A?A 1/2  0.027 [standard deviation]) (P = .0058). Stand-alone tumor ADCs showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 for discriminating low-grade versus high-grade tumors. Incorporating normal PZ ADC significantly improved the AUC to 0.96 (P = .0401).Conclusion:PZ ADCs show significant interpatient variation, which has a substantial effect on the prediction of prostate cancer aggressiveness. Correcting this effect results in a significant increase in diagnostic accuracy.A-A?A 1/2  RSNA, 2012.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {Purpose: The recent PI-RADS standard considers T2-weighted (T2W) MR the best imaging modality to characterize central gland (CG) lesions. In this study we assessed whether computer-aided diagnosis using T2 texture and relaxation features can separate benign and malignant CG lesions. Materials and Methods: MR scans of 101 patients were included in this study. The reference standard was MR-guided MR biopsy. Of these patients 36 had benign disease (e.g. benign prostatic hyperplasia) and 65 had prostate cancer. Lesions were annotated on the T2W sequence using a contouring tool. A quantitative T2 relaxation map was computed using an estimator that combines the T2W and proton density images with a turbo-spin-echo signal model and a gain factor. The latter was estimated using an automatically selected muscle reference region. Several texture voxel features were computed on the resulting T2-map: co-occurrenc matrix based homogeneity, neighboring gray-level dependence matrix based texture strength, and multi-scale Gaussian derivative features. For the latter 5 scales between 2 and 12 mm and derivatives up to the second order were calculated. For the matrix based features we calculated several histogram bin sizes (8, 16 and 32) and kernel sizes (4, 8 and 12 mm). The total number of texture features was 42. A linear discriminant classifier with feature selection was trained to compute the cancer likelihood for each voxel in the lesion. A feature selection was performed in a nested cross-validation loop using 10 folds. Cross-validation was performed in a leave-one-patient-out manner. For each annotated region a summary lesion likelihood was computed using the 75th percentile of the voxel likelihoods. The diagnostic accuracy of the lesion cancer likelihood was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and bootstrapping. Results: An area under the ROC curve of 0.76 (95% bootstrap confidence interval 0.64 A-A?A 1/2  0.87) was obtained for determining cancer likelihood using texture features, which is similar to radiologist performance reported in the literature when they only have T2W images available, like in this study. Conclusion: A novel method for characterizing lesions in T2-weighted MRI using texture descriptors was developed. The performance is in the range of values reported in the literature for radiologists. Clinical relevance: A CAD system for classification of CG lesions could improve the characterization of these lesions, which might result in better treatment planning.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the performance of the prostate imaging reporting and data standard (PI-RADS) and the effect of reader experience. Materials and Methods: A consecutive patient cohort of 254 patients who underwent both a detection MRI between January 1st, 2012 and December 31st, 2012 and a subsequent MR guided biopsy were included in this study. All patients were prospectively reported by one radiologist according to the PI-RADS guidelines. In total 10 different radiologists reported patients in this cohort. Of these 10 radiologists, 2 radiologist can be considered experts (19 and 12 years of experience with prostate MRI) and 8 can be considered inexperienced (3 years or less experience with prostate MRI). Together, the 2 experienced readers reported 108 patients and 146 were reported by the 8 inexperienced readers The radiologists reported 436 lesions in these patients of which 339 were biopsied. Of these 339 biopsied lesions 190 were prostate cancer. Of these 190 prostate cancer 127 lesions had a Gleason 4 or higher component and were considered high-grade prostate cancer, all others were considered low grade. The distribution of non-cancers, low-grade cancers and high-grade cancer was similar between the inexperienced and experienced observers (44%/19%/36% vs. 46%/16%/38%). Each lesion received, according to the PI-RADS guidelines, a score between 1 and 5. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated at each of the PI-RADS scores relative to the biopsy results. High-grade cancers with a PI-RADS score above or equal to the threshold are true positives. Non-cancers below the threshold were considered true negatives. This was done for both the inexperienced and experienced radiologists. Results: In total 19 PI-RADS 2, 67 PI-RADS 3, 112 PI-RADS 4 and 141 PI-RADS 5 lesions were biopsied. No PI-RADS 1 lesions were biopsied. The inexperienced reader sensitivities for PIRADS 2, 3, 4 and 5 are: 1, 1, 0.96 and 0.69 respectively. The experienced readers obtained 1, 1, 0.98 and 0.71. The corresponding specificities were 0, 0.16, 0.48 and 0.71 for the inexperienced and 0, 0.07, 0.36 and 0.76 for the experienced readers. The positive and negative predictive values were 0.46, 0.50, 0.61, 0.71 and 1, 1, 0.93, 0.74 for the inexperienced readers. For the experienced readers we obtained 0.46, 0.48, 0.57, 0.84 and 1, 1, 0.96, 0.78 respectively. Conclusion: In this population we can see that especially PI-RADS 4 and 5 classifications have excellent sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV characteristics. From this data we conclude that only PI-RADS 4 and 5 lesions require biopsy; inexperienced and experienced readers have sensitivities of 0.96 and 0.98 at this threshold. Experience matters: the number of unnecessary biopsies in PI-RADS 5 lesions reduces from 29/100 to 16/100 between experienced and inexperienced readers. Clinical relevance: PI-RADS reported lesions may help reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies. The strong effect of experience emphasizes the need for adequately trained radiologists for reporting prostate MR.},

  abstract = {Prostate MRI image segmentation has been an area of intense research due to the increased use of MRI as a modality for the clinical workup of prostate cancer. Segmentation is useful for various tasks, e.g. to accurately localize prostate boundaries for radiotherapy or to initialize multi-modal registration algorithms. In the past, it has been difficult for research groups to evaluate prostate segmentation algorithms on multi-center, multi-vendor and multi-protocol data. Especially because we are dealing with MR images, image appearance, resolution and the presence of artifacts are affected by differences in scanners and/or protocols, which in turn can have a large influence on algorithm accuracy. The Prostate MR Image Segmentation (PROMISE12) challenge was setup to allow a fair and meaningful comparison of segmentation methods on the basis of performance and robustness. In this work we will discuss the initial results of the online PROMISE12 challenge, and the results obtained in the live challenge workshop hosted by the MICCAI2012 conference. In the challenge, 100 prostate MR cases from 4 different centers were included, with differences in scanner manufacturer, field strength and protocol. A total of 11 teams from academic research groups and industry participated. Algorithms showed a wide variety in methods and implementation, including active appearance models, atlas registration and level sets. Evaluation was performed using boundary and volume based metrics which were combined into a single score relating the metrics to human expert performance. The winners of the challenge where the algorithms by teams Imorphics and ScrAutoProstate, with scores of 85.72 and 84.29 overall. Both algorithms where significantly better than all other algorithms in the challenge (p<0.05) and had an efficient implementation with a run time of 8min and 3s per case respectively. Overall, active appearance model based approaches seemed to outperform other approaches like multi-atlas registration, both on accuracy and computation time. Although average algorithm performance was good to excellent and the Imorphics algorithm outperformed the second observer on average, we showed that algorithm combination might lead to further improvement, indicating that optimal performance for prostate segmentation is not yet obtained.

  abstract = {Learning how to separate benign confounders from prostate cancer is important because the imaging characteristics of these confounders are poorly understood. Furthermore, the typical representations of the MRI parameters might not be enough to allow discrimination. The diagnostic uncertainty this causes leads to a lower diagnostic accuracy. In this paper a new cascaded classifier is introduced to separate prostate cancer and benign confounders on MRI in conjunction with specific computer-extracted features to distinguish each of the benign classes (benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), inflammation, atrophy or prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (PIN). In this study we tried to (1) calculate different mathematical representations of the MRI parameters which more clearly express subtle differences between different classes, (2) learn which of the MRI image features will allow to distinguish specific benign confounders from prostate cancer, and (2) find the combination of computer-extracted MRI features to best discriminate cancer from the confounding classes using a cascaded classifier. One of the most important requirements for identifying MRI signatures for adenocarcinoma, BPH, atrophy, inflammation, and PIN is accurate mapping of the location and spatial extent of the confounder and cancer categories from ex vivo histopathology to MRI. Towards this end we employed an annotated prostatectomy data set of 31 patients, all of whom underwent a multi-parametric 3 Tesla MRI prior to radical prostatectomy. The prostatectomy slides were carefully co-registered to the corresponding MRI slices using an elastic registration technique. We extracted texture features from the T2-weighted imaging, pharmacokinetic features from the dynamic contrast enhanced imaging and diffusion features from the diffusion-weighted imaging for each of the confounder classes and prostate cancer. These features were selected because they form the mainstay of clinical diagnosis. Relevant features for each of the classes were selected using maximum relevance minimum redundancy feature selection, allowing us to perform classifier independent feature selection. The selected features were then incorporated in a cascading classifier, which can focus on easier sub-tasks at each stage, leaving the more difficult classification tasks for later stages. Results show that distinct features are relevant for each of the benign classes, for example the fraction of extra-vascular, extra-cellular space in a voxel is a clear discriminator for inflammation. Furthermore, the cascaded classifier outperforms both multi-class and one-shot classifiers in overall accuracy for discriminating confounders from cancer: 0.76 versus 0.71 and 0.62.},

  abstract = {Laser interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) is a relatively new focal therapy technique for the ablation of localized prostate cancer. However, very little is known about the specific effects of LITT within the ablation zone and the surrounding normal tissue regions. For instance, it is important to be able to assess the extent of residual cancer within the prostate following LITT, which may be masked by thermally induced benign necrotic changes. Fortunately LITT is MRI compatible and hence this allows for quantitatively assessing LITT induced changes via multi-parametric MRI. Of course definite validation of any LITT induced changes on MRI requires confirmation via histopathology. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess and distinguish the imaging characteristics of prostate cancer and benign confounding treatment changes following LITTon 3 Tesla multi-parametric MRI by carefully mapping the treatment related changes from the ex vivo surgically resected histopathologic specimens onto the pre-operative in vivo imaging. A better understanding of the imaging characteristics of residual disease and successfully ablated tissue might lead to improved treatment monitoring and as such patient prognosis. A unique clinical trial at the Radboud University Medical Center, in which 3 patients underwent a prostatectomy after LITT treatment, yielded ex-vivo histopathologic specimens along with pre- and post-LITT MRI. Using this data we (1) identified the computer extracted MRI signatures associated with treatment effects including benign necrotic changes and residual disease and (2) subsequently evaluated the computer extracted MRI features previously identified in distinguishing LITT induced changes in the ablated area relative to the residual disease. Towards this end first a pathologist annotated the ablated area and the residual disease on the ex-vivo histology and then we transferred the annotations to the post-LITT MRI using semi-automatic elastic registration. The pre- and post-LITT MRI were subsequently registered and computer-derived multi-parametric MRI features extracted to determine differences in feature values between residual disease and successfully ablated tissue to assess treatment response. A scoring metric allowed us to identify those specific computer-extracted MRI features that maximally and differentially expressed between the ablated regions and the residual cancer, on a voxel- by voxel basis. Finally, we used a Fuzzy C-Means algorithm to assess the discriminatory power of these selected features. Our results show that specific computer-extracted features from multi-parametric MRI differentially express within the ablated and residual cancer regions, as evidenced by our ability to, on a voxel-by-voxel basis, classify tissue as residual disease. Additionally, we show that change of feature values between pre- and post-LITT MRI may be useful as a quantitative marker for treatment response (T2-weighted texture and DCE MRI features showed largest differences between residual disease and successfully ablated tissue). Finally, a clustering approach to separate treatment effects and residual disease incorporating both (1) and (2) yielded a maximum area under the ROC curve of 0.97 on a voxel basis across 3 studies.},

  abstract = {Prostate cancer is one of the major causes of cancer death for men in the western world. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being increasingly used as a modality to detect prostate cancer. Therefore, computer-aided detection of prostate cancer in MRI images has become an active area of research. In this paper we investigate a fully automated computer-aided detection system which consists of two stages. In the first stage, we detect initial candidates using multi-atlas-based prostate segmentation, voxel feature extraction, classification and local maxima detection. The second stage segments the candidate regions and using classification we obtain cancer likelihoods for each candidate. Features represent pharmacokinetic behavior, symmetry and appearance, among others. The system is evaluated on a large consecutive cohort of 347 patients with MR-guided biopsy as the reference standard. This set contained 165 patients with cancer and 182 patients without prostate cancer. Performance evaluation is based on lesion-based free-response receiver operating characteristic curve and patient-based receiver operating characteristic analysis. The system is also compared to the prospective clinical performance of radiologists. Results show a sensitivity of 0.42, 0.75, and 0.89 at 0.1, 1, and 10 false positives per normal case. In clinical workflow the system could potentially be used to improve the sensitivity of the radiologist. At the high specificity reading setting, which is typical in screening situations, the system does not perform significantly different from the radiologist and could be used as an independent second reader instead of a second radiologist. Furthermore, the system has potential in a first-reader setting.},

  abstract = {{PURPOSE} Accurate reporting of multi-parametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is difficult and requires substantial experience. We investigate the effect of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) on the diagnostic accuracy of prostate MRI reporting. {METHOD AND MATERIALS} Two consecutive cohorts of patients were used. One for training/development of the CAD system (347 patients) and one for the prospective evaluation (130 patients). Both cohorts comprise mpMRI and subsequent MR-guided biopsy and pathology. The mpMRIs were ESUR guideline compliant and performed on a Siemens 3T MRI without the use of an endo-rectal coil. Both cohorts were prospectively reported by one of ten radiologists according to the PI-RADS guidelines. Experience of the radiologists ranged from inexperienced to very experienced (1-20 years). The computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system comprised of a voxel classification stage and a subsequent candidate segmentation and classification stage. Features include quantified T2, ADC, pharmacokinetics, texture and anatomical characteristics. ROC and FROC analysis was used to evaluate performance. For the prospective validation the CAD system assigned a score to each radiologist-identified lesion. Logistic regression combining the radiologist and CAD scores was used to emulate independent, prospective CAD reading. Subsequently, the diagnostic performance in detecting intermediate-to-high-grade cancer of the CAD system alone, the radiologist alone and the radiologist CAD-system combination was evaluated using sensitivity and specificity for the different PI-RADS thresholds. Bootstrapping was used to assess significance. {RESULTS} FROC analyses showed that the CAD system could detect 82% of all intermediate-to-high-grade lesions at 1 false positive per case. Combined CAD and radiologist score significantly improved the sensitivity at a PI-RADS 4 threshold over the radiologist alone (0.98 for the combination, 0.93 for the radiologist alone, p = 0.029). A significantly improved specificity was found at a PI-RADS threshold of 3 (0.25 versus 0.09, p = 0.013). {CONCLUSION} CAD can achieve excellent performance. As a second observer to characterize prostate lesions it can improve sensitivity and specificity in discriminating intermediate-to-high-grade cancer. {CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION} Improving the performance of mpMRI in the detection of prostate cancer by CAD can prevent unnecessary biopsies.},

  abstract = {Automated detection of prostate cancer in digitized H and E whole-slide images is an important first step for computer-driven grading. Most automated grading algorithms work on preselected image patches as they are too computationally expensive to calculate on the multi-gigapixel whole-slide images. An automated multi-resolution cancer detection system could reduce the computational workload for subsequent grading and quantification in two ways: by excluding areas of definitely normal tissue within a single specimen or by excluding entire specimens which do not contain any cancer. In this work we present a multi-resolution cancer detection algorithm geared towards the latter. The algorithm methodology is as follows: at a coarse resolution the system uses superpixels, color histograms and local binary patterns in combination with a random forest classifier to assess the likelihood of cancer. The five most suspicious superpixels are identified and at a higher resolution more computationally expensive graph and gland features are added to refine classification for these superpixels. Our methods were evaluated in a data set of 204 digitized whole-slide H and E stained images of MR-guided biopsy specimens from 163 patients. A pathologist exhaustively annotated the specimens for areas containing cancer. The performance of our system was evaluated using ten-fold cross-validation, stratified according to patient. Image-based receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was subsequently performed where a specimen containing cancer was considered positive and specimens without cancer negative. We obtained an area under the ROC curve of 0.96 and a 0.4 specificity at a 1.0 sensitivity.},

  abstract = {Prostate MRI is becoming an increasingly popular imaging technique for the detection of prostate cancer. However, it requires a substantial amount of expertise and time from radiologists to accurately report on prostate MRI. Furthermore, quantitative analysis is needed for accurate assessment of cancer aggressiveness in vivo. Computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) systems are excellent tools to tackle these challenges. In this thesis the design of such a systems is discussed. CAD systems are typically a connected pipeline of differing algorithms performing consecutive tasks, for example segmentation, feature extraction and classification. We followed a similar outline in this thesis. In Chapter 2 we discuss the segmentation of the prostate capsule in the setting of a 'grand challenge'. Further division of the prostate capsule in distinct anatomical zones is the topic of Chapter 3. After segmentation of the capsule and the prostate zones, features discriminative for cancer and cancer aggression are discussed in Chapter 4 and 5. The interconnection of the components into one unified CAD system is subsequently discussed in Chapter 6 and the evaluation of the system in a clinical setting in Chapter 7. In this last Chapter we not only show that designing a fully automated CAD system is feasbile, but that it can be used to the benefit of radiologists.},

All cases were prospectively PIRADS reported and the reported lesions underwent CAD analysis. Logistic regression combined the CAD prediction and radiologist PIRADS score into a combination score. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and Spearman's correlation coefficient were used to assess the diagnostic accuracy and correlation to cancer grade. Evaluation was performed for discriminating benign lesions from cancer and for discriminating indolent from aggressive lesions.In total 141 lesions (107 patients) were included for final analysis. The area-under-the-ROC-curve of the combination score was higher than for the PIRADS score of the radiologist (benign vs. cancer, 0.88 vs. 0.81, pAC/a,!aEURdeg=AC/a,!aEURdeg0.013 and indolent vs. aggressive, 0.88 vs. 0.78, pAC/a,!aEURdeg<AC/a,!aEURdeg0.01).

Furthermore, such a combination score has a strong correlation with cancer grade.AC/a,!AC/ Computer-aided diagnosis helps radiologists discriminate benign findings from cancer in prostate MRI.

  abstract = {Cancer diagnosis and pharmaceutical research increasingly depend on the accurate quantification of cancer biomarkers. Identification of biomarkers is usually performed through immunohistochemical staining of cancer sections on glass slides. However, combination of multiple biomarkers from a wide variety of immunohistochemically stained slides is a tedious process in traditional histopathology due to the switching of glass slides and re-identification of regions of interest by pathologists. Digital pathology now allows us to apply image registration algorithms to digitized whole-slides to align the differing immunohistochemical stains automatically. However, registration algorithms need to be robust to changes in color due to differing stains and severe changes in tissue content between slides. In this work we developed a robust registration methodology to allow for fast coarse alignment of multiple immunohistochemical stains to the base hematyoxylin and eosin stained image. We applied HSD color model conversion to obtain a less stain color dependent representation of the whole-slide images. Subsequently, optical density thresholding and connected component analysis were used to identify the relevant regions for registration. Template matching using normalized mutual information was applied to provide initial translation and rotation parameters, after which a cost function-driven affine registration was performed. The algorithm was validated using 40 slides from 10 prostate cancer patients, with landmark registration error as a metric. Median landmark registration error was around 180 microns, which indicates performance is adequate for practical application. None of the registrations failed, indicating the robustness of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {To determine the best features to discriminate prostate cancer from benign disease and its relationship to benign disease class and cancer grade.The institutional review board approved this study and waived the need for informed consent. A retrospective cohort of 70 patients (age range, 48-70 years; median, 62 years), all of whom were scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy and underwent preoperative 3-T multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast material-enhanced imaging, were included. The digitized prostatectomy slides were annotated for cancer and noncancerous disease and coregistered to MR imaging with an interactive deformable coregistration scheme. Computer-identified features for each of the noncancerous disease categories (eg, benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH], prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia [PIN], inflammation, and atrophy) and prostate cancer were extracted. Feature selection was performed to identify the features with the highest discriminatory power. The performance of these five features was evaluated by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).High-b-value diffusion-weighted images were more discriminative in distinguishing BPH from prostate cancer than apparent diffusion coefficient, which was most suitable for distinguishing PIN from prostate cancer. The focal appearance of lesions on dynamic contrast-enhanced images may help discriminate atrophy and inflammation from cancer. Which imaging features are discriminative for different benign lesions is influenced by cancer grade. The apparent diffusion coefficient appeared to be the most discriminative feature in identifying high-grade cancer. Classification results showed increased performance by taking into account specific benign types (AUC = 0.70) compared with grouping all noncancerous findings together (AUC = 0.62).The best features with which to discriminate prostate cancer from noncancerous benign disease depend on the type of benign disease and cancer grade. Use of the best features may result in better diagnostic performance.},

Through two examples, prostate cancer identification in biopsy specimens and breast cancer metastasis detection in sentinel lymph nodes, we show the potential of this new methodology to reduce the workload for pathologists, while at the same time increasing objectivity of diagnoses. We found that all slides containing prostate cancer and micro- and macro-metastases of breast cancer could be identified automatically while 30-40\% of the slides containing benign and normal tissue could be excluded without the use of any additional immunohistochemical markers or human intervention. We conclude that 'deep learning' holds great promise to improve the efficacy of prostate cancer diagnosis and breast cancer staging.},

  abstract = {Background: The presence of lymph node metastases is one of the most important factors in breast cancer prognosis. The most common strategy to assess the regional lymph node status is the sentinel lymph node procedure. The sentinel lymph node is the most likely lymph node to contain metastasized cancer cells and is excised, histopathologically processed and examined by the pathologist. This tedious examination process is time-consuming and can lead to small metastases being missed. However, recent advances in whole-slide imaging and machine learning have opened an avenue for analysis of digitized lymph node sections with computer algorithms. For example, convolutional neural networks, a type of machine learning algorithm, are able to automatically detect cancer metastases in lymph nodes with high accuracy. To train machine learning models, large, well-curated datasets are needed.
                             Results: We released a dataset of 1399 annotated whole-slide images of lymph nodes, both with and without metastases, in total three terabytes of data in the context of the CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 Grand Challenges. Slides were collected from five different medical centers to cover a broad range of image appearance and staining variations. Each whole-slide image has a slide-level label indicating whether it contains no metastases, macro-metastases, micro-metastases or isolated tumor cells. Furthermore, for 209 whole-slide images, detailed hand-drawn contours for all metastases are provided. Last, open-source software tools to visualize and interact with the data have been made available.
                             Conclusions: A unique dataset of annotated, whole-slide digital histopathology images has been provided with high potential for re-use.},

To deal with the resulting large number of features, we proposed a combination of feature-oriented classifiers combining each group of texture features into a single likelihood, resulting in three additional features used for the final classification. The classification was performed using support vector machine classifiers, and the evaluation was done with 10-fold cross validation on a dataset containing 424 lesions (239 benign and 185 malignant lesions). We compared the classification performance of the CAD system with and without texture features.

A bottom-up approach for arriving to an optimal set of branches and their associated labels is used in the proposed method. A K nearest neighbor based appearance model is used to differentiate the different anatomical branches. The proposed method was applied on 33 computed tomography scans of different subjects, where an average of 24 anatomical branches were correctly detected out of a total of 29 anatomical branches. Additionally, the proposed method was also evaluated on trees with simulated errors, such as missing branches and having falsely detected branches, where we showed that such errors have little or no effect on the proposed method.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a framework for establishing a reference airway tree segmentation, which was used to quantitatively evaluate fifteen different airway tree extraction algorithms in a standardized manner. Because of the sheer difficulty involved in manually constructing a complete reference standard from scratch, we propose to construct the reference using results from all algorithms that are to be evaluated. We start by subdividing each segmented airway tree into its individual branch segments. Each branch segment is then visually scored by trained observers to determine whether or not it is a correctly segmented part of the airway tree. Finally, the reference airway trees are constructed by taking the union of all correctly extracted branch segments. Fifteen airway tree extraction algorithms from different research groups are evaluated on a diverse set of twenty chest computed tomography ({CT}) scans of subjects ranging from healthy volunteers to patients with severe pathologies, scanned at different sites, with different {CT} scanner brands, models, and scanning protocols. Three performance measures covering different aspects of segmentation quality were computed for all participating algorithms. Results from the evaluation showed that no single algorithm could extract more than an average of 74\% of the total length of all branches in the reference standard, indicating substantial differences between the algorithms. A fusion scheme that obtained superior results is presented, demonstrating that there is complementary information provided by the different algorithms and there is still room for further improvements in airway segmentation algorithms.},

  abstract = {Segmentation of the pulmonary lobes from chest {CT} scans is a challenging problem, especially with the presence of incomplete pulmonary fissures. We present an iterative approach for the segmentation of pulmonary lobes via a surface that evolves based on a voxel based fissure confidence function and a smooth prior. The surface is constructed such that it separates the whole lung at all times, and is represented as a height map above a {2D} reference plane. A surface evolution process is used to fit the surface to a pulmonary fissure in a scan. At each iteration, the height of all points in the map is adjusted such that the overall confidence is maximized, followed by {L}aplacian smoothing to enforce a smooth prior on the surface. The proposed method was trained and tuned on 18 {CT} scans from a clinical trial, and tested on 41 scans of different patients with severe emphysema from another clinical trial. Average overlap ratio of the segmented upper and lower lobes of the left and right lungs are 0.96 and 0.91 respectively. Average overlap ratio for the right middle lobes is 0.86, where minor manual intervention was needed for six cases, and with seven cases excluded because the minor fissure was almost entirely not visible in the {CT} scan.},

  abstract = {Automated segmentation of the pulmonary lobes from chest {CT} scans is a challenging problem that is yet to be solved reliably. Therefore there is a need for a semi-automated solution in the case where the automated solution fails. We present an approach that can be used for correcting an existing lobe segmentation or segmenting the lobes from scratch in a semi-automatic manner. The method is based on an iterative approach that evolves a surface based on a voxel based fissure confidence function, smooth prior and user input points. An advantage of the proposed method is that it takes into account both inputs from user and the appearance of fissures in the image, which in turn reduces the number of user interactions required. The proposed method was trained and tuned on 18 {CT} scans, and tested on 22 {CT} scans from different subjects with either idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or severe emphysema. On average, the proposed method requires 37 user drawn line segments, which are mostly short, to segment all lobes accurately. We did not notice a large difference in the number of required line segments between starting from scratch or correcting lobe segmented from an automated method, as it usually requires only two lines in two different view plane from the user to obtain a relatively accurate fissure from scratch.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast density, a strong breast cancer risk factor, is usually measured on the projected breast area from film screen mammograms. This is far from ideal, as breast thickness and technical characteristics are not taken into account. We investigated whether volumetric density measurements on full-field digital mammography (FFDM) are more strongly related to breast cancer risk factors than measurements with a computer-assisted threshold method.METHODS: Breast density was measured on FFDMs from 370 breast cancer screening participants, using a computer-assisted threshold method and a volumetric method. The distribution of breast cancer risk factors among quintiles of density was compared between both methods. We adjusted for age and body mass index (BMI) with linear regression analysis.RESULTS: High percent density was strongly related to younger age, lower BMI, nulliparity, late age at first delivery and pre/perimenopausal status, to the same extent with both methods (all p<0.05). Similarly strong relationships were seen for the absolute dense area, but to a lesser extent for absolute dense volume. A larger dense volume was only significantly associated with late age at menopause, use of menopausal hormone therapy, and, in contrast to the other methods, high BMI.CONCLUSIONS: Both methods related equally well to known breast cancer risk factors. Impact:Despite its alleged higher precision, the volumetric method was not more strongly related to breast cancer risk factors. This is in agreement with other studies. The definitive relationship with breast cancer risk still needs to be investigated.},

  abstract = {{T}he past few years have witnessed a significant increase in the number of supervised methods employed in diverse image processing tasks. {E}specially in medical image analysis the use of, for example, supervised shape and appearance modelling has increased considerably and has proven to be successful. {T}his thesis focuses on applying supervised pattern recognition methods in medical image processing. {W}e consider a local, pixel-based approach in which image segmentation, regression, and filtering tasks are solved using descriptors of the local image content (features) based on which decisions are made that provide a class label (in case of image segmentation) or a gray value (in case of filtering or regression) for every pixel. {T}he basic probabilistic decision problem, underlying---implicitly or explicitly---all the methods presented in this thesis, can be stated in terms of a conditional probability optimization problem u = argmax_y {P}(y|x) in which x is a d-dimensional vector of measurements, i.e., a feature vector, describing the local image content and y is a quantity that takes values from a set {Y}. {T}ypically, in a classification task, {Y} is a discrete set of labels and in case of regression, {Y} equals {R}. {B}ased on the maximization in the previous equation, to every vector x (which is associated to a pixel in an image), a particular u from {Y} is associated. {T}his approach is - because of its local nature - quite different from the shape and appearance methods mentioned in the beginning of this chapter which try to solve image processing tasks in a more global way. {A} recent comparative study [{B}. van {G}inneken, {M}. {B}. {S}tegmann, and {M}. {L}oog. {S}egmentation of anatomical structures in chest radiographs using supervised methods: a comparative study on a public database, {M}edical {I}mage {A}nalysis, 2006] shows that in image segmentation, pixel-based approaches can compete with shape and appearance models, providing an interesting alternative to the latter. {T}he principal methodological part of the thesis consists of three dimensionality reduction methods that can aid the extraction of relevant features to be used for performing image segmentation or regression. {F}urthermore, an iterative segmentation scheme is developed which draws from classical pattern recognition and machine learning methods. {F}inally, two applications of these techniques in two problems related to computer-aided diagnosis ({CAD}) in chest radiography are presented. {F}irstly, the task of segmenting the posterior ribs is considered. {S}econdly, a regression framework is presented, which aims at suppressing bony structures in chest radiographs.},

  abstract = {{A} novel framework for image filtering based on regression is presented. {R}egression is a supervised technique from pattern recognition theory in which a mapping from a number of input variables (features) to a continuous output variable is learned from a set of examples from which both input and output are known. {W}e apply regression on a pixel level. {A} new, substantially different, image is estimated from an input image by computing a number of filtered input images (feature images) and mapping these to the desired output for every pixel in the image. {T}he essential difference between conventional image filters and the proposed regression filter is that the latter filter is learned from training data. {T}he total scheme consists of preprocessing, feature computation, feature extraction by a novel dimensionality reduction scheme designed specifically for regression, regression by k-nearest neighbor averaging, and (optionally) iterative application of the algorithm. {T}he framework is applied to estimate the bone and soft-tissue components from standard frontal chest radiographs. {A}s training material, radiographs with known soft-tissue and bone components, obtained by dual energy imaging, are used. {T}he results show that good correlation with the true soft-tissue images can be obtained and that the scheme can be applied to images from a different source with good results. {W}e show that bone structures are effectively enhanced and suppressed and that in most soft-tissue images local contrast of ribs decreases more than contrast between pulmonary nodules and their surrounding, making them relatively more pronounced.},

However, these findings are considered to be not exclusively specific for IgG4-related disease. Methods: The occurrence of the histologic patterns reported in patients with isolated lymphadenopathy was studied and correlated with the clinical presentation to determine their predictive value for IgG4-related lymphadenopathy. Results: We found cases meeting all histologic criteria for IgG4-related lymphadenopathy, without clinical signs of IgG4-related disease. The only pattern that was not seen in this series was an inflammatory pseudotumor-like picture. Conclusion: Without a clinical suspicion of IgG4-related disease, these morphologic patterns and high numbers of IgG4-positive plasma cells should be interpreted with care to avoid an erroneous diagnosis of IgG4-related disease.},

  abstract = {Ultrasound images have already been successfully leveraged in the early screening for neuromuscular disease (NMD). However, the current rule-based screening method requires the manual annotation of regions of interest (ROI) and can only be extended to new ultrasound machines after the costly collection of a reference sample. This work proposes to solve both these problems with end-to-end training of a deep-learning classier on multiple images per patient. We demonstrate the suitability of the method for screening, with no need for ROI annotation. We also investigate various methods for domain adaptation. Simple adaptation methods are shown to already work well and could allow easy transfer of the screening method between different ultrasound devices.},

  abstract = {The aims of this study were to assess the discriminative performance of quantitative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) between prostate cancer and noncancer tissues and between tumor grade groups (GGs) in a multicenter, single-vendor study, and to investigate to what extent site-specific differences affect variations in mpMRI parameters. Fifty patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer from 5 institutions underwent a standardized preoperative mpMRI protocol. Based on the evaluation of whole-mount histopathology sections, regions of interest were placed on axial T2-weighed MRI scans in cancer and noncancer peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) tissue. Regions of interest were transferred to functional parameter maps, and quantitative parameters were extracted. Across-center variations in noncancer tissues, differences between tissues, and the relation to cancer grade groups were assessed using linear mixed-effects models and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Variations in quantitative parameters were low across institutes (mean [maximum] proportion of total variance in PZ and TZ, 4% [14%] and 8% [46%], respectively). Cancer and noncancer tissues were best separated using the diffusion-weighted imaging-derived apparent diffusion coefficient, both in PZ and TZ (mean [95% confidence interval] areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUCs]; 0.93 [0.89-0.96] and 0.86 [0.75-0.94]), followed by MR spectroscopic imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced-derived parameters. Parameters from all imaging methods correlated significantly with tumor grade group in PZ tumors. In discriminating GG1 PZ tumors from higher GGs, the highest AUC was obtained with apparent diffusion coefficient (0.74 [0.57-0.90], P < 0.001). The best separation of GG1-2 from GG3-5 PZ tumors was with a logistic regression model of a combination of functional parameters (mean AUC, 0.89 [0.78-0.98]). Standardized data acquisition and postprocessing protocols in prostate mpMRI at 3 T produce equivalent quantitative results across patients from multiple institutions and achieve similar discrimination between cancer and noncancer tissues and cancer grade groups as in previously reported single-center studies.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

In this report, we summarize briefly some recent advances in our use of MRI for AF management with special focus on the impact of these findings on the modeling and simulation of AF. We summarize results from two clinical studies, one of patients before radio frequency ablation of atrial fibrillation and one after ablation. In pre-ablation patients, significant extent of enhancements in delayed enhancement MRI of the left atrium is predictive of worsened outcome from ablation. The presumed mechanism is the presence of fibrosis in the posterior wall of the left atrium and supports the known finding that patients in chronic atrial fibrillation develop elevated levels of fibrosis. The implications of this finding on modeling of atrial electrical activity are that any such models must include both structural and functional fibrosis if they are to reflect realistic conditions.},

ICH or AIH comprise of internal bleeding (intra-axial) or external (extra-axial) to the brain substance. Large bleeds like in intra-axial region are easy to diagnose whereas it can be challenging if small bleed occurs in extra-axial region particularly in the absence of contrast. Bleed region needs to be distinguished from bleed-look-alike brain regions which are abnormally bright falx and fresh flowing blood. We propose an algorithm for detection of brain bleed in various anatomical locations. A preprocessing step is performed to segment intracranial contents and enhancement of region of interests(ROIs). A number of bleed and bleed- look- alike candidates are identified from a set of 11 available cases. For each candidate texture based features are extracted from non-separable quincunx wavelet transform along with some other descriptive features. The candidates are randomly divided into a training and test set consisting of both bleed and bleed-look-alike. A supervised classifier is designed based on the training sample features. A performance accuracy of 96% is attained for the independent test candidates.},

  booktitle = {The Fourth International Workshop on Pulmonary Image Analysis},
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {Cavities are air-filled spaces within a pulmonary consolidation and can be indicative of various diseases like primary bronchogenic carcinoma, mycobacterium tuberculosis, cancer and infections. Segmentation of cavities is a challenging task in chest radiographs due to the presence of superimposed structures. It is important to accurately measure the extent of cavitation to measure temporal changes and response to therapy. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic technique for cavity border segmentation based on dynamic programming. A pixel classifier is trained using cavity border pixels based on Gaussian, location and Hessian features to construct a cavity wall likelihood map. A polar transformation of this likelihood map around the seed point is then used as a cost function to find an optimal border using dynamic programming. We have validated our technique on 50 chest radiographs (2048 x 2048 resolution, pixel size 0.25 mm, Delft Imaging Systems, The Netherlands) containing in total 50 cavities. These cavities have been manually outlined by three human experts, one chest radiologist and two readers certified to read chest radiographs according to a tuberculosis scoring system. The automatic border segmentations are compared with manual segmentations provided by the readers using Jaccard overlapping measure. The agreement between the automatically determined outlines is comparable to the inter-observer agreement.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {PURPOSE Accurate measurement of the size of cavities on chest radiographs (CXRs) is important for tuberculosis (TB) treatment monitoring and to make the decision to start TB treatment in the case of smear-negativeTB suspects. An automatic technique for cavity segmentation is presented and compared to inter-reader agreement of human experts. METHOD AND MATERIALS A data set of 105 digital CXRs (2048 A-A?A 1/2  2048 resolution, pixel size 0.25 mm, Delft Imaging Systems, The Netherlands) was collected at Kanyama Health Clinic, Lusaka, Zambia and University of Cape Town Lung Institute, Cape Town, South Africa. For training and system development, 20 CXRs with one cavity and 30 normal cases were used. For evaluation, 55 CXRs with one cavity were used. These cavities were manually outlined by three human experts, one chest radiologist and two readers certi??ed to read CXRs according to the Chest Radiograph Reading and Recording System. Cavities are automatically segmented after the user clicks near the cavity center. A pixel classi??er was trained to construct a cavity wall likelihood map. The classifier uses Gaussian, location and Hessian features and was trained with pixels within 1 mm of a cavity border as positive examples and random pixels from normal CXRs as negative examples. A polar transformation of the likelihood map around the center point was used as a cost function to search for an optimal border using dynamic programming. Cavity segmentations are compared using Jaccard overlap measure. Cases where the average overlap between pairs of manual expert segmentations is above/below 0.80 are defined as obvious/challenging cases. RESULTS The evaluation data contained 37 obvious and 18 challenging cases. The average overlap between manual expert segmentations was 0.87 A-A?A 1/2  0.02 and 0.67 A-A?A 1/2  0.05 for the obvious and challenging cases, respectively. For automatic versus manual segmentation the average overlap was 0.77 A-A?A 1/2  0.01 and 0.66 A-A?A 1/2  0.01, respectively. CONCLUSION Cavity segmentation is a challenging task with considerable disagreement between human expert readers. Our automated algorithm shows results comparable to experts and can be considered as an effectual and consistent method for cavity size measurements in CXR. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Automatic cavity segmentation on chest radiographs can facilitate TB treatment follow-up and help to make a clinical decision regarding the start of TB treatment.},

  abstract = {Computer aided detection (CAD) of tuberculosis (TB) on chest radiographs (CXR) is challenging due to overlapping structures. Suppression of normal structures can reduce overprojection effects and can enhance the appearance of diffuse parenchymal abnormalities. In this work, we compare two CAD systems to detect textural abnormalities in chest radiographs of TB suspects. One CAD system was trained and tested on the original CXR and the other CAD system was trained and tested on bone suppression images (BSI). BSI were created using a commercially available software (ClearRead 2.4, Riverain Medical). The CAD system is trained with 431 normal and 434 abnormal images with manually outlined abnormal regions. Subtlety rating (1-3) is assigned to each abnormal region, where 3 refers to obvious and 1 refers to subtle abnormalities. Performance is evaluated on normal and abnormal regions from an independent dataset of 900 images. These contain in total 454 normal and 1127 abnormal regions, which are divided into 3 subtlety categories containing 280, 527 and 320 abnormal regions respectively. For normal regions, original/BSI CAD has an average abnormality score of 0.094A,A+-0.027/0.085A,A+-0.032 (p < 0.001). For abnormal regions, subtlety 1, 2, 3 categories have average abnormality scores for original/BSI of 0.155A,A+-0.073/0.156A,A+-0.089 (p = 0.73), 0.194A,A+-0.086/0.207A,A+-0.101 (p < 0.001), 0.225A,A+-0.119/0.247A,A+-0.117 (p < 0.001) respectively. CAD prototype is benefited by BSI in terms of increased accuracy of abnormality probabilistic maps. We therefore conclude that the use of bone suppression results in slightly but significantly improved automated detection of textural abnormalities in chest radiographs.},

  abstract = {Computer aided detection (CAD) of tuberculosis (TB) on chest radiographs (CXR) is difficult because the disease has varied manifestations, like opacification, hilar elevation, and pleural effusions. We have developed a CAD research prototype for TB (CAD4TB v1.08, Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Nijmegen, The Netherlands) which is trained to detect textural abnormalities inside unobscured lung fields. If the only abnormality visible on a CXR would be a blunt costophrenic angle, caused by pleural fluid in the costophrenic recess, this is likely to be missed by texture analysis in the lung fields. The goal of this work is therefore to detect the presence of blunt costophrenic (CP) angles caused by pleural effusion on chest radiographs. The CP angle is the angle formed by the hemidiaphragm and the chest wall. We define the intersection point of both as the CP angle point. We first detect the CP angle point automatically from a lung field segmentation by finding the foreground pixel of each lung with maximum y location. Patches are extracted around the CP angle point and boundary tracing is performed to detect 10 consecutive pixels along the hemidiaphragm and the chest wall and derive the CP angle from these. We evaluate the method on a data set of 250 normal CXRs, 200 CXRs with only one or two blunt CP angles and 200 CXRs with one or two blunt CP angles but also other abnormalities. For these three groups, the CP angle location and angle measurements were correct in 91%, 88%, and 92% of all the cases, respectively. The average CP angles for the three groups are indeed different with 71.6A,Adeg A,A+- 22.9, 87.5A,Adeg A,A+- 25.7, and 87.7A,Adeg A,A+- 25.3, respectively.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Digital chest radiography (CXR) is used in high burden countries for suspect screening, active case finding and in prevalence surveys for TB diagnosis. An observer study was conducted to compare performance of automatic software with that of clinical officers and certified expert readers. Methods and Materials: A dataset of 166 digital CXRs (2048AfaEUR?2048, 0.25 mm, Delft Imaging Systems, The Netherlands) was collected at Kanyama Clinic, Lusaka, Zambia. Sputum culture was used as reference. An observer study was conducted with four clinical officers who read x-rays in Kanyama Clinic, and with two readers certified to read CXRs according to CRRS standard (University of Cape Town, South Africa). A software system for detection of TB (CAD4TB-1.08, Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, The Netherlands) analyzed all the cases. Human readers and software scored all the images between 0-100. We report area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve(Az) with 95% confidence intervals and pairwise comparisons from bootstrap estimates. p<0.05 was considered significant. Results: The dataset contained 99 positive and 67 negative cases. Az for the software was 0.72(0.63-0.80). Az values of CRRS certified readers were 0.71(0.63-0.79) and 0.72(0.64-0.78). Mean Az for clinical officers was 0.70(0.65-0.76). There was no significant difference between any reader and the software, except for one clinical officer who performed significantly worse than automatic reading. Conclusion: Automatic computer reading has similar performance as clinical officers and certified readers. The software has potential of being used as a point-of-care decision tool, to diagnose TB or select subjects that should undergo further tests.},

OBJECTIVE: To compare the accuracy of automated reading (CAD4TB) with the interpretation of digital chest radiograph (CXR) by clinical officers for the detection of tuberculosis (TB). DESIGN: A retrospective analysis was performed on 161 subjects enrolled in a TB specimen bank study. CXRs were analysed using CAD4TB, which computed an image abnormality score (0-100). Four clinical officers scored the CXRs for abnormalities consistent with TB. We compared the automated readings and the readings by clinical officers against the bacteriological and radiological results used as reference. We report here the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and kappa () statistics. RESULTS: Of 161 enrolled subjects, 97 had bacteriologically confirmed TB and 120 had abnormal CXR. The AUCs for CAD4TB and the clinical officers were respectively 0.73 and 0.65-0.75 in comparison with the bacteriological reference, and 0.91 and 0.89-0.94 in comparison with the radiological reference. P values indicated no significant differences, except for one clinical officer who performed significantly worse than CAD4TB (P < 0.05) using the bacteriological reference. values for CAD4TB and clinical officers with radiological reference were respectively 0.61 and 0.49-0.67. CONCLUSION: CXR assessment using CAD4TB and by clinical officers is comparable. CAD4TB has potential as a point-of-care test and for the automated identification of subjects who require further examinations.},

  abstract = {Efficacy of tuberculosis (TB) treatment is often monitored using chest radiography. Monitoring size of cavities in pulmonary tuberculosis is important as the size predicts severity of the disease and its persistence under therapy predicts relapse. The authors present a method for automatic cavity segmentation in chest radiographs.A two stage method is proposed to segment the cavity borders, given a user defined seed point close to the center of the cavity. First, a supervised learning approach is employed to train a pixel classifier using texture and radial features to identify the border pixels of the cavity. A likelihood value of belonging to the cavity border is assigned to each pixel by the classifier. The authors experimented with four different classifiers:k-nearest neighbor (kNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), GentleBoost (GB), and random forest (RF). Next, the constructed likelihood map was used as an input cost image in the polar transformed image space for dynamic programming to trace the optimal maximum cost path. This constructed path corresponds to the segmented cavity contour in image space.The method was evaluated on 100 chest radiographs (CXRs) containing 126 cavities. The reference segmentation was manually delineated by an experienced chest radiologist. An independent observer (a chest radiologist) also delineated all cavities to estimate interobserver variability. Jaccard overlap measure AZA(c) was computed between the reference segmentation and the automatic segmentation; and between the reference segmentation and the independent observer's segmentation for all cavities. A median overlap AZA(c) of 0.81 (0.76 A,A+- 0.16), and 0.85 (0.82 A,A+- 0.11) was achieved between the reference segmentation and the automatic segmentation, and between the segmentations by the two radiologists, respectively. The best reported mean contour distance and Hausdorff distance between the reference and the automatic segmentation were, respectively, 2.48 A,A+- 2.19 and 8.32 A,A+- 5.66 mm, whereas these distances were 1.66 A,A+- 1.29 and 5.75 A,A+- 4.88 mm between the segmentations by the reference reader and the independent observer, respectively. The automatic segmentations were also visually assessed by two trained CXR readers as "excellent," "adequate," or "insufficient." The readers had good agreement in assessing the cavity outlines and 84\% of the segmentations were rated as "excellent" or "adequate" by both readers.The proposed cavity segmentation technique produced results with a good degree of overlap with manual expert segmentations. The evaluation measures demonstrated that the results approached the results of the experienced chest radiologists, in terms of overlap measure and contour distance measures. Automatic cavity segmentation can be employed in TB clinics for treatment monitoring, especially in resource limited settings where radiologists are not available.},

  title = {Computerized Reading of Chest Radiographs in The Gambia National Tuberculosis Prevalence Survey: Retrospective Comparison with Human Experts},
  booktitle = {Union World Conference on Lung Health},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Rationale: Tuberculosis (TB) prevalence surveys require recruitment of trained personnel for reading chest radiographs (CXRs), which is scarce in high TB burden countries. Computerized CXR reading could replace human readers in such a scenario and we retrospectively investigate this possibility on data from the 2011-2013 TB prevalence survey in The Gambia. Methods: Computerized readings were compared with field and central readings on 4,552 CXRs. The survey participants were screened based on symptoms and CXR findings. Field readers judged CXRs on radiological findings as: Normal, Abnormal, suggestive of TB? or Other abnormalities; the latter two were considered abnormal. In case of symptoms and/or abnormal CXR, sputum samples were collected and bacteriological tests (fluorescence microscopy and BACTEC MGIT culture) were performed for confirmatory TB diagnosis. Following the analysis, 73 subjects with proven TB were considered Abnormal and the remainder as Normal. The CXRs were centrally audited by an expert reader and one of the following categories was assigned to each CXR: Normal, Active TB, Abnormal, healed TB, or Other pathology. The software (CAD4TB, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands) computed a TB score between 0-100 (0-Normal, 100-Abnormal) for each CXR. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated for CAD4TB and various cut-off points were chosen on the TB score to compare specificities at the sensitivities of the field and central readings. Results: The field reading achieved a sensitivity of 86.3% at 72.8% specificity. The central reading had a sensitivity of 67.1% at 93.3% specificity, and when the healed TB category was considered abnormal, sensitivity increased to 87.7% with a decrease in specificity to 65.2%. CAD4TB attained an AUC of 0.90 and at all three sensitivity levels of human readers, specificity was nearly identical and not significantly different (p-value>0.05): at field sensitivity, CAD4TB had a specificity of 72.2%, and for central sensitivity levels, specificities of 93.7% and 66.0% (healed TB as abnormal) were obtained. Conclusions: When selecting subjects in a prevalence survey on the basis of chest radiography to undergo confirmatory testing for TB, the performance of computerized reading is not significantly different from field and central readings by human experts. The software has potential to improve the efficiency of TB prevalence surveys.},

  abstract = {Automated detection of Tuberculosis (TB) using chest radiographs (CXRs) is gaining popularity due to the lack of trained human readers in resource limited countries with a high TB burden. The majority of the computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for TB focus on detection of parenchymal abnormalities and ignore other important manifestations such as pleural effusion (PE). The costophrenic angle is a commonly used measure for detecting PE, but has limitations. In this work, an automatic method to detect PE in the left and right hemithoraces is proposed and evaluated on a database of 638 CXRs. We introduce a robust way to localize the costophrenic region using the chest wall contour as a landmark structure, in addition to the lung segmentation. Region descriptors are proposed based on intensity and morphology information in the region around the costophrenic recess. Random forest classifiers are trained to classify left and right hemithoraces. Performance of the PE detection system is evaluated in terms of recess localization accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The proposed method shows significant improvement in the AUC values as compared to systems which use lung segmentation and the costophrenic angle measurement alone.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel fully automatic unsupervised framework for the segmentation of brain tissues in magnetic resonance (MR) images. The framework is a combination of our proposed Bayesian-based adaptive mean shift (BAMS), a priori spatial tissue probability maps and fuzzy c-means. BAMS is applied to cluster the tissues in the joint spatialintensity feature space and then a fuzzy c-means algorithm is employed with initialization by a priori spatial tissue probability maps to assign the clusters into three tissue types; white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The proposed framework is validated on multimodal synthetic as well as on real T1-weighted MR data with varying noise characteristics and spatial intensity inhomogeneity. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated relative to our previous method BAMS and other existing adaptive mean shift framework. Both of these are based on the mode pruning and voxel weighted k-means algorithm for classifying the clusters into WM, GM and CSF tissue. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework to noise and spatial intensity inhomogeneity, and that it exhibits a higher degree of segmentation accuracy in segmenting both synthetic and real MR data compared to competing methods.},

  abstract = {The chest radiograph is the most common imaging modality to assess childhood pneumonia. It has been used in epidemiological and vaccine efficacy/effectiveness studies on childhood pneumonia. To develop computer-aided diagnosis (CAD4Kids) for chest radiography in children and to evaluate its accuracy in identifying World Health Organization (WHO)-defined chest radiograph primary-endpoint pneumonia compared to a consensus interpretation. Chest radiographs were independently evaluated by three radiologists based on WHO criteria. Automatic lung field segmentation was followed by manual inspection and correction, training, feature extraction and classification. Radiographs were filtered with Gaussian derivatives on multiple scales, extracting texture features to classify each pixel in the lung region. To obtain an image score, the 95  percentile score of the pixels was used. Training and testing were done in 10-fold cross validation. The radiologist majority consensus reading of 858 interpretable chest radiographs included 333 (39%) categorised as primary-endpoint pneumonia, 208 (24%) as other infiltrate only and 317 (37%) as no primary-endpoint pneumonia or other infiltrate. Compared to the reference radiologist consensus reading, CAD4Kids had an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.850 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.823-0.876), with a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 80% for identifying primary-endpoint pneumonia on chest radiograph. Furthermore, the ROC curve was 0.810 (95% CI 0.772-0.846) for CAD4Kids identifying primary-endpoint pneumonia compared to other infiltrate only. Further development of the CAD4Kids software and validation in multicentre studies are important for future research on computer-aided diagnosis and artificial intelligence in paediatric radiology.},

Given their scientific impact, it is surprising that a critical analysis of common practices related to the organization of challenges has not yet been performed. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of biomedical image analysis challenges conducted up to now. We demonstrate the importance of challenges and show that the lack of quality control has critical consequences. First, reproducibility and interpretation of the results is often hampered as only a fraction of relevant information is typically provided. Second, the rank of an algorithm is generally not robust to a number of variables such as the test data used for validation, the ranking scheme applied and the observers that make the reference annotations. To overcome these problems, we recommend best practice guidelines and define open research questions to be addressed in the future.},

  abstract = {We explore the energy dissipation of the Linear Processor Array (LPA) as a function of the number of available resources (Processor Units P) within the array. This number P is an important parameter, as it reflects performance, relates parallel processing to energy dissipation, and influences the scaling of the various parts of the LPA architecture (memory, address generator, communication network). To make a comparison of the different design variants for a fixed datawidth possible, we propose a high-level energy dissipation model of the processor, which is based on a detailed analysis of a general convolution algorithm. It is shown that the energy dissipation of the LPA can roughly be described by the relationship Etotal ? N/P with N presenting the datawidth in pixels. This relationship is derived from two observations: first, the largest contribution to Etotal is formed by the energy dissipated by the memories, and second, in our model of the LPA, the datawidth of the memories corresponds with the number of pixels N to be processed, which results in an increase of the access rate when P decreases. Furthermore, we have shown that the energy dissipation caused by communication within the LPA, increases with increasing number of resources: the trade-off between communication versus computation in parallel computing. This turns out to be negligible in the total energy dissipation, and we therefore conclude, that the optimum solution is found, when a full number of resources is applied within the LPA.},

Moreover, a local approach is significantly faster.

  abstract = {An extension to level set based segmentation is proposed for vascular tree delineation. The method starts with topology extraction, by a shape constrained level set evolution steered by a strictly positive, image base speed function to ensure some oversegmentation. Next, the skeleton of the resulting oversegmentation is determined, which then is used to initialise another level set steered by a speed function with both negative and positive speed forces based on image features, to obtain a most accurate segmentation. The novelty of our approach lies in the shape constraint that is imposed implicitly on the first level set evolution. We apply repeatedly re-initializations of this evolution with a topology preserving skeleton of the current zero level set. We compare this method with a plain level set evolution steered by the same full range speed function. Both are initialised by placing a single seed point at the root of the vessel tree. Pilot experiments on twelve multislice CT data sets of the Circle of Willis show that our method is capable of segmenting the smaller branches at the distal part of the vessel tree structures and has the potential to segment vessels which are distal to a severe stenosis or occlusion.},

In this work we incorporate Frangi's multiscale vessel filter, which is based on a geometrical analysis of the Hessian' eigenvectors, into a nonlinear, anisotropic diffusion scheme, such that diffusion mainly takes place along the vessel axis while diffusion perpendicular to this axis is inhibited. The multiscale character of the vesselness filter ensures an equally good response for varying vessel radii. The first, theoretical contribution of this paper is the modification of the original formulation of this vessel filter, such that it becomes a smooth function on its domain which is a necessary condition imposed by the diffusion process to ensure well-posedness. The second contribution concerns the application of noise filtering of 3D synthetic, phantom computed tomography (CT) and patient CT data. It is shown that the method is very effective in noise filtering, illustrating its potential as a preprocessing step in the analysis of low dose CT angiography.},

  abstract = {A novel approach for vessel axis tracking is presented based on surface evolution in 3D. The main idea is to guide the evolution by analyzing the topology of intermediate segmentation results, and in particular, to impose shape constraints on the topology. For example, the topology can be constrained to represent a bifurcation, which can be imposed by extracting three different connected paths with maximum length from the skeleton of intermediate segmentation results. The evolving surface is then re-initialized with the newly found topology. Re-initialization is a crucial step since it creates probing behavior of the evolving front and prevents the surface from leaking into the background. The method was evaluated in two CTA applications (i) extracting the internal carotid arteries including the region in which they traverse through the skull base, which is challenging due to the close proximity of bone structures and overlap in intensity values, and (ii) extracting the carotid bifurcation, some of them severely stenosed and most of them containing calcifications. Using only the image gradient as the image force in the surface evolution and a single seed point as initialization, the method was successful in 80% of ten internal carotids in five patients, and 80% of ten carotid bifurcations in five patients, respectively},

  abstract = {A level set based method is presented for cerebral vascular tree segmentation from computed tomography angiography (CTA) data. The method starts with bone masking by registering a contrast enhanced scan with a low-dose mask scan in which the bone has been segmented. Then an estimate of the background and vessel intensity distributions is made based on the intensity histogram which is used to steer the level set to capture the vessel boundaries. The relevant parameters of the level set evolution are optimized using a training set. The method is validated by a diameter quantification study which is carried out on phantom data, representing ground truth, and 10 patient data sets. The results are compared to manually obtained measurements by two expert observers. In the phantom study, the method achieves similar accuracy as the observers, but is unbiased whereas the observers are biased, i.e., the results are 0.00+/-0.23 vs. -0.32+/-0.23 mm. Also, the method's reproducibility is slightly better than the inter-and intra-observer variability. In the patient study, the method is in agreement with the observers and also, the method's reproducibility -0.04+/-0.17 mm is similar to the inter-observer variability 0.06+/-0.17 mm. Since the method achieves comparable accuracy and reproducibility as the observers, and since the method achieves better performance than the observers with respect to ground truth, we conclude that the level set based vessel segmentation is a promising method for automated and accurate CTA diameter quantification},

  abstract = {A method is proposed to enhance vascular structures within the framework of scale space theory. We combine a smooth vessel filter which is based on a geometrical analysis of the Hessian's eigensystem, with a non-linear anisotropic diffusion scheme. The amount and orientation of diffusion depend on the local vessel likeliness. Vessel enhancing diffusion (VED) is applied to patient and phantom data and compared to linear, regularized Perona-Malik, edge and coherence enhancing diffusion. The method performs better than most of the existing techniques in visualizing vessels with varying radii and in enhancing vessel appearance. A diameter study on phantom data shows that VED least affects the accuracy of diameter measurements. It is shown that using VED as a preprocessing step improves level set based segmentation of the cerebral vasculature, in particular segmentation of the smaller vessels of the vasculature.},

  title = {Automated Detection of the Internal Carotid Arteries in Multislice Cerebral {CT} Angiography},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: Automated Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) detection, as preprocessing step for fully automatic vascular segmentation, diameter quantification or aneurysms detection in cerebral Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA). METHOD AND MATERIAL: A new three step method to automatically detect seed points in the Internal Carotid Artery in CTA is developed and evaluated. First, the image entropy per slice is computed, from which a cross sectional 2D plane which contains the carotids can automatically be defined by selecting the plane with maximum information. Subsequently, an automatic segmentation of high intensity objects in this region is performed. Finally, a Hough transform is applied to detect two structures which have the most circular shape. The method has been evaluated on 30 randomly selected patients who were examined for acute cerebrovascular events or for screening purposes. The data, acquired on a 16-slice CT scanner (Philips Mx8000), consisted of approximately 300 slices (512x512) with an in plane resolution of 0.3125x0.3125 mm and slice spacing of 0.5 mm. Visual inspection was used to determine whether the carotid arteries were correctly detected. RESULTS: In 60 ICAs of the 30 patients, a success rate of 91.6% (55/60) was achieved. CONCLUSION: Automated seed point placement in the ICA is feasible, which facilitates automatic initialization of e.g. vessel segmentation and quantification. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: Automated initialization enables complete automation of the processing of large CTA data sets, reduces operator time and is not subject to observer variability.},

  abstract = {In this thesis we develop and validate novel image processing techniques for the analysis of vascular structures in medical images. First a new type of filter is proposed which is capable of enhancing vascular structures while suppressing noise in the remainder of the image. This filter is based on a controlled smoothing process and results in a so-called scale space representation of the vascular structures. This representation can be used as preprocessing step for other vascular image processing techniques, such as vessel axis tracking and vessel segmentation. Second, a new method is proposed to track the central vessel axis in vessels with known topology. The method utilizes surface evolution which is typically applied to object segmentation. In our approach surface evolution is extended by repeatedly estimating and constraining the current vessel axis. This way, vessel information is gathered while the vessel axis tracking method proceeds along the vessel. Finally, an automated method is proposed for segmentation of the complete intracranial arterial vasculature. The methods are applied to, and evaluated on 3D head and neck Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) data sets.},

  abstract = {An approach to three-dimensional vessel axis tracking based on surface evolution is presented. The main idea is to guide the evolution of the surface by analyzing its skeleton topology during evolution, and imposing shape constraints on the topology. For example, the intermediate topology can be processed such that it represents a single vessel segment, a bifurcation, or a more complex vascular topology. The evolving surface is then re-initialized with the newly found topology. Re-initialization is a crucial step since it creates probing behavior of the evolving front, encourages the segmentation process to extract the vascular structure of interest and reduces the risk on leaking of the curve into the background. The method was evaluated in two computed tomography angiography applications: (i) extracting the internal carotid arteries including the region in which they traverse through the skull base, which is challenging due to the proximity of bone structures and overlap in intensity values, and (ii) extracting the carotid bifurcations including many cases in which they are severely stenosed and contain calcifications. The vessel axis was found in 90% (18/20 internal carotids in ten patients) and 70% (14/20 carotid bifurcations in a different set of ten patients) of the cases.},

The parameters of this method were optimized on the training subset of nine patients, and the method was successful at segmentation of the arteries in 15 (83%) of the 18 remaining patients.

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an image processing tool that requires minimal user interaction and automatically extracts the atherosclerotic bifurcation in CTA METHOD AND MATERIALS: We propose a two step approach: First, the central vessel axis is obtained based on path tracking between three user defined points. Second, starting from this path, the final segmentation is automatically obtained using a level set which is steered by a novel, slice feature-based speed function. We evaluate the method on a large data set of 234 carotid bifurcations of 129 ischemic stroke patients with atherosclerotic disease. The results are compared to manually obtained lumen segmentations. Parameter optimization is carried out on a subset of 30 representative carotid bifurcations. RESULTS: With the optimized parameter settings the method successfully tracked the central vessel paths in 201 of the remaining 204 bifurcations (99%) which were not part of the training set. Comparison with manually drawn segmentations shows an average overlap of 94% which is slightly less than the overlap between observers (96%). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge is this the first method which has been tested on such a large number of patient data. The results show that robust and accurate segmentation of the atherosclerotic bifurcation in CT angiography is feasible. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: This work is highly relevant for clinical research/practice: lumen segmentation of the diseased bifurcation is the first step for stenosis grading, plaque characterization and hemodynamic modeling.},

  booktitle = ECR,
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Purpose: Abdominal tissue type differentation and quantification is increasingly becoming important in the pathophysiology of e.g. cardiovacular disease [1] and metabolic syndrome [2,3]. However 3D image processing methods for the automated analysis of computed tomography (CT) data providing objective measurements are currently lacking. Current methods are limited to 2D [4-6], or have been developed for magnetic resonance imaging [7,8]. The purpose of this work is to develop a fully automated and intrinsically 3D image analysis method which is capable of labeling and quantifying the subcutaneous and visceral fat of the abdomen in CT. Methods and Materials:A three step approach is adopted: First, the patient body is separated from the background and table by applying morphological operators. Then a 3D mesh is deformed which is steered by image intensity and gradient information to delineate the abdominal region. This region is defined by the pelvis, diaphragm and the muscle layer of the abdominal wall. Finally, the subcutaneous and visceral fat are separated by thresholding using the Hounsfield units inside and outside the abdominal region. The method is applied to CTA scans of 14 patients which were scheduled for noncardiac vascular surgery. Weight, BMI index and the level of triglyceride in blood of each patient were acquired. Fat volumes were measured using the proposed method. Results: Correlations between total, visceral, subcutaneous fat volumes (TV, VV, SV) and weight, BMI and triglyceride were investigated. Significant correlations were found for (PearsonA-A?A 1/2 s coefficient, only the strongest correlations are reported, significance p<0.01 for all): Weight-TV r=0.821, BMI-TV r=0.868, triglyceride-VV r=0.684. Conclusion: To our knowledge we have presented the first intrinsically 3D method which is capable of fully automatically segmenting the subcutaneous and visceral fat of the abdomen in CTA. Preliminary results suggest a correlation between triglyceride and visceral fat volume.},

No difference in v(e) -values was noted between groups. Visual assessment of contrast-enhancement versus time curves revealed wash-out curves to be less common in ILC (48\% versus 84\%). However, when using the CAD-application to assess the most malignant looking curve, the difference was blotted out (76\% versus 86\%).ILC enhances slower than IDC but peak enhancement is not significantly less. The use of a CAD-application may help to determine the most malignant looking contrast-enhancement versus time curve, and hence facilitates lesion classification.},

We evaluate the maximum slope of initial contrast enhancement as a heuristic parameter for differentiating benign from malignant disease and compare its value to classic 3 timepoint analysis. Methods and Materials: We employed a bi-temporal breast MRI protocol on a 3 T MRI using a 16 channel bilateral breast coil. High-resolution VIBE acquisitions (0.8*0.8*1.0 mm, temporal resolution 94s) were interleaved with a series of ultrafast TWIST acquisitions (1*1*2.5 mm, temporal resolution 4.2s) during the inflow of the contrast agent. Forty-two consecutive patients with 43 enhancing abnormalities (21 benign and 22 malignant) presenting between November 2010 and July 2011 were included. We measured the maximum slope of the relative enhancement versus time curve on the TWIST acquisitions and recorded curve type of the lesions on the VIBE acquisitions. ROC analysis was performed to compare diagnostic performance. Results: The maximum slope of the relative enhancement versus time curve was significantly better in discriminating between benign and malignant disease than the curve type (Az 0.865 vs. Az 0.723, p = 0.036). Cutoff values of 15%/sec and 3.15%/sec can be used to differentiate high-risk lesions (>85% malignancies) from intermediate and low-risk lesions (<10% malignancies). This simplification yields an Az of 0.808. Conclusion: The initial maximum slope provides more diagnostic information than the curve types and can therefore be used to assess lesion dynamics. This can substantially shorten current scan protocols.},

Modern view-sharing sequences now enable ultrafast dynamic whole-breast MRI, allowing much shorter and more cost-effective procedures. This study evaluates whether dynamic information from ultrafast breast MRI can be used to replace standard dynamic information to preserve accuracy.We interleaved 20 ultrafast time-resolved angiography with stochastic trajectory (TWIST) acquisitions (0.9 AfaEUR? 1 AfaEUR? 2.5 mm, temporal resolution, 4.3 seconds) during contrast inflow in a regular high-resolution dynamic MRI protocol. A total of 160 consecutive patients with 199 enhancing abnormalities (95 benign and 104 malignant) were included. The maximum slope of the relative enhancement versus time curve (MS) obtained from the TWIST and curve type obtained from the regular dynamic sequence as defined in the breast imaging reporting and data system (BIRADS) lexicon were recorded. Diagnostic performance was compared using receiver operating characteristic analysis.All lesions were visible on both the TWIST and standard series. Maximum slope allows discrimination between benign and malignant disease with high accuracy (area under the curve, 0.829). Types of MS were defined in analogy to BIRADS curve types: MS type 3 implies a high risk of malignancy (MS >13.3\%/s; specificity, 85\%), MS type 2 yields intermediate risk (MS <13.3\%/s and >6.4\%/s), and MS type 1 implies a low risk (MS <6.4\%/s; sensitivity, 90\%). This simplification provides a much higher accuracy than the much lengthier BIRADS curve type analysis does (area under the curve, 0.812 vs 0.692; P = 0.0061).Ultrafast dynamic breast MRI allows detection of breast lesions and classification with high accuracy using MS. This allows substantial shortening of scan protocols and hence reduces imaging costs, which is beneficial especially for screening.},

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and informed consent was waived. Twenty consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who underwent CT perfusion imaging with a 320AC/a,!aEURoedetector row CT scanner were included. A standard acquisition protocol was used, which was started 5 seconds after injection of a contrast agent, with a scan at 200 mAs, followed after 4 seconds by 13 scans, one every 2 seconds, at 100 mAs, and then five scans, one every 5 seconds, at 75 mAs. The total examination had an average effective dose of 5.0 mSv. For each patient, a patient-specific digital perfusion phantom was constructed to simulate the same protocol at a lower total dose (0.5AC/a,!aEURoe5.0 mSv, with stepped doses of 0.5 mSv). The lowest setting for which the maximum mean difference remained within 5% of the reference standard (at 5.0 mSv) was marked as the optimal setting. At the optimal setting, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess correlations with the reference values, and paired t tests were performed to compare the means. Results: At 2.5 mSv, the maximum mean differences in values from those of the reference standard were 4.5%, 5.0%, and 1.9%, for cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and mean transit time, respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients of perfusion values for white matter and gray matter were 0.864AC/a,!aEURoe0.917, and all differences were significant (P < .0001). Paired t tests showed no significant differences between the reference standard and optimal settings (P = .089AC/a,!aEURoe.923). Conclusion: The total dose of a clinical cerebral CT perfusion protocol can be lowered to 2.5 mSv, with only minor quantitative effects on perfusion values. Dose reduction beyond this point resulted in overestimation of perfusion values.},

  abstract = {Brain perfusion is of key importance to assess brain function. Modern CT scanners can acquire perfusion maps of the cerebral parenchyma in vivo at submillimeter resolution. These perfusion maps give insights into the hemodynamics of the cerebral parenchyma and are critical for example for treatment decisions in acute stroke. However, the relations between acquisition parameters, tissue attenuation curves, and perfusion values are still poorly understood and cannot be unraveled by studies involving humans because of ethical concerns. We present a 4D CT digital phantom specific for an individual human brain to analyze these relations in a bottom-up fashion. Validation of the signal and noise components was based on 1000 phantom simulations of 20 patient imaging data. This framework was applied to quantitatively assess the relation between radiation dose and perfusion values, and to quantify the signal-to-noise ratios of penumbra regions with decreasing sizes in white and gray matter. This is the first 4D CT digital phantom that enables to address clinical questions without having to expose the patient to additional radiation dose.},

  title = {White Matter and Gray Matter Segmentation in {4D CT} Images of Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients: a Feasibility Study},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: White matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) respond differently to ischemia and thrombolytic treatment. Being able to differentiate WM/GM in CT enables tissue dependent perfusion analysis and automated detection of stroke related pathology. In this work we show the feasibility of segmenting WM/GM in 4DCT images of acute ischemic stroke patients.

                             METHOD AND MATERIALS: In total 18 stroke patients who received both a 4DCT and followup MR scan were included in this retrospective study. CT imaging was done on a 320 row scanner with 19 or 24 volumetric acquisitions after contrast injection resulting in 512x512x320 isotropic voxels of 0.5 mm. T1w imaging was done on a 1.5T MR scanner resulting in approximately 384x318x26 voxels of 0.6x0.6x5.5 mm. The MR image was segmented with FSL tools and served as reference standard to train and evaluate the method. The method starts with brain segmentation by atlas registration followed by a refinement using a geodesic active contour with dominating advection term steered by a gradient based speed function. Within the segmented brain, three groups of features are then extracted: intensity, contextual and temporal, including a multiscale representation of the temporal average image weighted according to the exposures of the individual time points to maximize the signaltonoise ratios. In total 120 features were then fed into a nonlinear support vector machine with Gaussian radial basis kernel. A leaveonepatient out cross validation was carried out. Segmentation results were visually inspected for overall quality. Dice coefficient (DC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD) were reported.

                             RESULTS: The segmentations were evaluated as good with the separation of WM/GM at the cortex good to excellent. GM segmentation at the cortex had generally less thickness variations compared to the reference standard. DC were 0.79+-0.06 and 0.77+-0.06, 95% HD were 8.71+-3.22 and 7.11+-3.93 mm, for WM and GM, respectively.

                             CONCLUSION: WM and GM segmentation in 4DCT is feasible.


                             CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: WM and GM segmentation in 4DCT enables tissue dependent perfusion analysis and may increase sensitivity of detecting core and penumbra. Volume measurements of WM and GM normalized with the contralateral side may yield an important diagnostic parameter in the acute phase of ischemia.},

Soft tissue segmentation is important for subsequent applications such as tissue dependent perfusion analysis and automated detection and quantification of cerebral pathology. In this work a method is presented to automatically segment white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) in contrast- enhanced 4D CT images of the brain.

Next, three groups of voxel features are extracted: intensity, contextual, and temporal. These are used to segment WM and GM with a support vector machine. Performance was assessed using cross validation in a leave-one-patient-out manner on 22 patients. Dice coefficients were 0.81$\pm$0.04 and 0.79$\pm$0.05, 95% Hausdorff distances were 3.86$\pm$1.43 and 3.07$\pm$1.72 mm, for WM and GM, respectively.

  abstract = {Hybrid video compression schemes need to store the local decoded image for predictive coding. Traditionally, this image is stored in the spatial domain needing almost 5 Mbit of memory for main-level image format. The amount of storage space can be significantly reduced if the data is stored in the compressed domain itself, using embedded compression techniques. Embedded compression typically has a lossless part. This function is subject to various constraints imposed by the remainder of the system. In this paper we arrive at three candidate algorithms for the lossless compression function. These are: implementing a zoning approach, implementing a variant of vector-coding using a codebook and implementing position-coding respectively. The three algorithms are analyzed for performance and hardware costs.},

  title = {Power Analysis of a General Convolution Algorithm mapped on a Linear Processor Array},
  abstract = {We explore the energy dissipation of the Linear Processor Array (LPA) as a function of the number of available resources (Processor Units P) within the array. This number P is an important parameter, as it reflects performance, relates parallel processing to energy dissipation, and influences the scaling of the various parts of the LPA architecture (memory, address generator, communication network). To make a comparison of the different design variants for a fixed datawidth possible, we propose a high-level energy dissipation model of the processor, which is based on a detailed analysis of a general convolution algorithm. It is shown that the energy dissipation of the LPA can roughly be described by the relationship Etotal ? N/P with N presenting the datawidth in pixels. This relationship is derived from two observations: first, the largest contribution to Etotal is formed by the energy dissipated by the memories, and second, in our model of the LPA, the datawidth of the memories corresponds with the number of pixels N to be processed, which results in an increase of the access rate when P decreases. Furthermore, we have shown that the energy dissipation caused by communication within the LPA, increases with increasing number of resources: the trade-off between communication versus computation in parallel computing. This turns out to be negligible in the total energy dissipation, and we therefore conclude, that the optimum solution is found, when a full number of resources is applied within the LPA.},

  title = {Multi{\_}Scale{\_}Tools: A Python Library to Exploit Multi-Scale Whole Slide Images},
  doi = {10.3389/fcomp.2021.684521},
  volume = {3},
  abstract = {Algorithms proposed in computational pathology can allow to automatically analyze digitized tissue samples of histopathological images to help diagnosing diseases. Tissue samples are scanned at a high-resolution and usually saved as images with several magnification levels, namely whole slide images (WSIs). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) represent the state-of-the-art computer vision methods targeting the analysis of histopathology images, aiming for detection, classification and segmentation. However, the development of CNNs that work with multi-scale images such as WSIs is still an open challenge. The image characteristics and the CNN properties impose architecture designs that are not trivial. Therefore, single scale CNN architectures are still often used. This paper presents Multi_Scale_Tools, a library aiming to facilitate exploiting the multiscale structure of WSIs. Multi_Scale_Tools currently include four components: a preprocessing component, a scale detector, a multi-scale CNN for classification and a multiscale CNN for segmentation of the images. The pre-processing component includes methods to extract patches at several magnification levels. The scale detector allows to identify the magnification level of images that do not contain this information, such as images from the scientific literature. The multi-scale CNNs are trained combining features and predictions that originate from different magnification levels. The components are developed using private datasets, including colon and breast cancer tissue samples. They are tested on private and public external data sources, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The results of the library demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability. The scale detector accurately predicts multiple levels of image magnification and generalizes well to independent external data. The multi-scale CNNs outperform the single-magnification CNN for both classification and segmentation tasks. The code is developed in Python and it will be made publicly available upon publication. It aims to be easy to use and easy to be improved with additional functions.},

  title = {Artificial intelligence-assisted detection of adhesions on cine-MRI},
  abstract = {Adhesive disease, which commonly occurs as a postoperative complication, is a major cause of morbidity and places a substantial burden on healthcare worldwide. Currently, laparoscopy is the only accurate diagnostic technique for abdominal adhesions, which intrinsically involves health risks including the formation of new adhesions. Non-invasive diagnostic methods with similar reliability are lacking. In recent years using cine-MRI scans of the abdomen captured during respiration has demonstrated promising performance in the diagnosis of adhesions. However, correct interpretation of cine- MRI scans requires considerable radiological expertise and this technique has not been widely adopted in clinical practice yet. In this masters thesis, the first fully-automated multistage computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) method for adhesion detection is proposed. The method exploits the phenomenon of visceral slide, a pattern of abdominal motion observed during respiration in healthy subjects. Local reduction of visceral slide is a diagnostic criterion of adhesions. Visceral slide that occurs on a cine-MRI slice is quantified using a segmentation mask generated by a deep learning model and a deformation field between cine-MRI frames obtained with an image registration algorithm. Bounding boxes of adhesions are predicted with a region growing method based on the visceral slide values. Additionally, false positives reduction driven by domain knowledge is performed. The impact of using all cine-MRI time points and different normalisation options are investigated and the hyper-parameters of the method are determined with 5-fold cross-validation. When evaluated with cross-validation, the best method configuration yields detection sensitivity of 0:61 and 0:73 at 1 and 2 false positives per slice along with 0:53 AUC in slice-level diagnosis. On the held-out test set, a slightly different configuration is top-performing and achieves detection sensitivity of 0:7 and 0:91 at 1 and 1:89 false positive per slice along with 0:78 slice-level AUC, which indicates the promising potential of the core idea of the method.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To demonstrate the feasibility of magnetic resonance lymphography (MRL) -guided delineation of a boost volume and an elective target volume for pelvic lymph node irradiation in patients with prostate cancer. The feasibility of irradiating these volumes with a high-dose boost to the MRL-positive lymph nodes in conjunction with irradiation of the prostate using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) was also investigated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 4 prostate cancer patients with a high risk of lymph node involvement but no enlarged lymph nodes on CT and/or MRI, MRL detected pathological lymph nodes in the pelvis. These lymph nodes were identified and delineated on a radiotherapy planning CT to create a boost volume. Based on the location of the MRL-positive lymph nodes, the standard elective pelvic target volume was individualized. An IMRT plan with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) was created with dose prescriptions of 42 Gy to the pelvic target volume, a boost to 60 Gy to the MRL-positive lymph nodes, and 72 Gy to the prostate. RESULTS: All MRL-positive lymph nodes could be identified on the planning CT. This information could be used to delineate a boost volume and to individualize the pelvic target volume for elective irradiation. IMRT planning delivered highly acceptable radiotherapy plans with regard to the prescribed dose levels and the dose to the organs at risk (OARs). CONCLUSION: MRL can be used to select patients with limited lymph node involvement for pelvic radiotherapy. MRL-guided delineation of a boost volume and an elective pelvic target volume for selective high-dose lymph node irradiation with IMRT is feasible. Whether this approach will result in improved outcome for these patients needs to be investigated in further clinical studies.},

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-five candidates for salvage radiation therapy were referred for an MRL to determine their lymph node status. Clinical and histopathologic features were recorded. For 49 patients, data were complete to calculate the Stephenson nomogram score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine how well this nomogram related to the MRL result. Analysis was done for the whole group and separately for patients with a PSA <1.0 ng/mL to determine the situation in candidates for early salvage radiation therapy, and for patients without pathologic lymph nodes at initial lymph node dissection. RESULTS: MRL detected positive lymph nodes in 47 patients. ROC analysis for the Stephenson nomogram yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95\% confidence interval, 0.61-0.93). Of 29 patients with a PSA <1.0 ng/mL, 18 had a positive MRL. Of 37 patients without lymph node involvement at initial lymph node dissection, 25 had a positive MRL. ROC analysis for the Stephenson nomogram showed AUCs of 0.84 and 0.74, respectively, for these latter groups. CONCLUSION: MRL detected positive lymph nodes in 72\% of candidates for salvage radiation therapy, in 62\% of candidates for early salvage radiation therapy, and in 68\% of initially node-negative patients. The Stephenson nomogram showed a good correlation with the MRL result and may thus be useful for identifying patients with a PSA recurrence who are at high risk for lymph node involvement.},

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The charts of 47 prostate cancer patients with PSA recurrence after prostatectomy who had positive lymph nodes on magnetic resonance lymphography (MRL) were reviewed. Positive lymph nodes were assigned to a lymph node region according to the guidelines of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) for delineation of the CTV for pelvic irradiation (RTOG-CTV). We defined four lymph node regions for positive nodes outside this RTOG-CTV: the para-aortal, proximal common iliac, pararectal, and paravesical regions. They were referred to as aberrant lymph node regions. For each patient, clinical and pathologic features were recorded, and their association with aberrant lymph drainage was investigated. The distribution of positive lymph nodes was analyzed separately for patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <1.0 ng/mL. RESULTS: MRL detected positive aberrant lymph nodes in 37 patients (79\%). In 20 patients (43\%) a positive lymph node was found in the pararectal region. Higher PSA at the time of MRL was associated with the presence of positive lymph nodes in the para-aortic region (2.49 vs. 0.82 ng/mL; p=0.007) and in the proximal common iliac region (1.95 vs. 0.59 ng/mL; p=0.009). There were 18 patients with a PSA <1.0 ng/mL. Ten of these patients (61\%) had at least one aberrant positive lymph node. CONCLUSION: Seventy-nine percent of the PSA-recurrent patients had at least one aberrant positive lymph node. Application of the standard RTOG-CTV for pelvic irradiation in the salvage setting therefore seems to be inappropriate.},

The detection of positive lymph nodes is, however, a complex and time consuming task for experienced radiologists. Assistance of a two-stage Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) system in MR Lymphography (MRL) is not yet feasible due to the large number of false positives in the first stage of the system. By introducing a multi-structure, multi-atlas segmentation, using an affine transformation followed by a B-spline transformation for registration, the organ location is given by a mean density probability map. The atlas segmentation is semi-automatically drawn with ITK-SNAP, using Active Contour Segmentation. Each anatomic structure is identified by a label number. Registration is performed using Elastix, using Mutual Information and an Adaptive Stochastic Gradient optimization. The dataset consists of the MRL scans of ten patients, with lymph nodes manually annotated in consensus by two expert readers. The feature map of the CAD system consists of the Multi-Atlas and various other features (e.g. Normalized Intensity and multi-scale Blobness). The voxel-based Gentleboost classifier is evaluated using ROC analysis with cross validation. We show in a set of 10 studies that adding multi-structure, multi-atlas anatomical structure likelihood features improves the quality of the lymph node voxel likelihood map. Multiple structure anatomy maps may thus make MRL CAD more feasible.},

  abstract = {Purpose
                             There is currently controversy regarding the benefits of deconvolution-based parameters in stroke imaging, with studies suggesting a similar infarct prediction using summary parameters. We investigate here the performance of deconvolution-based parameters and summary parameters for dynamic-susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI analysis, with particular emphasis on precision.

                             Methods
                             Numerical simulations were used to assess the contribution of noise and arterial input function (AIF) variability to measurement precision. A realistic AIF range was defined based on in vivo data from an acute stroke clinical study. The simulated tissue curves were analyzed using two popular singular value decomposition (SVD) based algorithms, as well as using summary parameters.

                             Results
                             SVD-based deconvolution methods were found to considerably reduce the AIF-dependency, but a residual AIF bias remained on the calculated parameters. Summary parameters, in turn, show a lower sensitivity to noise. The residual AIF-dependency for deconvolution methods and the large AIF-sensitivity of summary parameters was greatly reduced when normalizing them relative to normal tissue.

                             Conclusion
                             Consistent with recent studies suggesting high performance of summary parameters in infarct prediction, our results suggest that DSC-MRI analysis using properly normalized summary parameters may have advantages in terms of lower noise and AIF-sensitivity as compared to commonly used deconvolution methods.},

  title = {Segmentation of small cerebral vessels on {CT} perfusion images of patients with suspected acute stroke},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: Due to partial volume effects, accurate segmentation of small cerebral vessels on {CT} is a challenge. We present a novel technique that incorporates local intensity histogram information to segment the cerebral vasculature on {CT} perfusion ({CTP}) scans for suspected ischemic stroke.

                             METHOD AND MATERIALS: A pattern recognition approach based on global and local image features followed by a random forest classifier is proposed. The features consist of an automatically computed brain mask denoting intracranial tissue, the first volume of the {CTP} scan, the {CTP} scan temporal average weighted according to the individual exposures to maximize signal-to-noise ratio, the weighted temporal variance ({WTV}), and local histogram features of the {WTV} calculated in a neighborhood of 9x9x9 voxels around a centered voxel. The mean, standard deviation, entropy and mode of the histogram are extracted as local feature values. In total 26 patients that underwent {CTP} for suspicion of stroke were included in this study. The {CTP} was acquired on a 320-detector row scanner. Image size was 512x512x320 voxels by 19 time points with voxel sizes of approximately 0.5 mm. Training was done on 8 patients with manually annotated data. The remaining 18 patients were used as testing set. Segmentations were visually inspected for completeness and overall quality. 3D-patches including the {M2}/{M3} segments of the middle cerebral artery were manually annotated for quantitative evaluation. The modified Hausdorff distance ({MHD}) (maximum of the median {HD}s) and the accuracy (true positive + true negative voxels divided by amount of voxels in a patch) of the segmentation were reported for the annotated patches.

                             RESULTS: Overall the method was capable of segmenting the complete cerebral vasculature with inclusion of very small distal vessels. Parts of one internal carotid was missed in one patient because of clipping artefacts. In 3 patients false positive voxels were observed in the skull base region near the internal carotid artery and cavernous sinus. The {MHD} was 0.51A-A?A 1/2 0.28 mm, which is similar to the voxel spacing, and the accuracy was 0.97A-A?A 1/2 0.01.

                             CONCLUSION: Our approach provides high-quality segmentation of small cerebral vessels from {CTP} data.

                             CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: The high quality segmentation provided by our approach is an important step towards the automated localization and evaluation of vascular pathology in acute stroke patients.},

  title = {Detection of vessel occlusion in acute stroke is facilitated by color-coded {4D-CTA}},
  booktitle = ECR,
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {PURPOSE
                             To perform a pilot study to explore the effect of a new post-processing technique for 4D-CTA on speed and accuracy of the detection of intracranial vessel occlusions in acute stroke. This technique color-codes the contrast arrival time in the cerebral vasculature in 4D-CTA so that abnormally delayed vascular territories are easily detected.
                             METHOD AND MATERIALS
                             We selected 10 patients without and 10 patients with a confirmed single vessel occlusion on CTA from our database of acute ischemic stroke patients, so that occlusions of the ICA, MCA, ACA and PCA of varying subtlety were included. Whole-brain CT perfusion was performed on a 320 detector-row scanner. Color-coded 4D-CTA images were obtained by centering the color scale of vessel time-to-peak (TTP) on the modus of the TTP histogram. Temporal MIP of 4D-CTA with and without color-coding were evaluated in random order for the presence of vessel occlusion by to two neuroradiologists. Time-to-detection and accuracy of detection of vessel occlusions were evaluated.
                             RESULTS
                             One false-positive vessel occlusion was rated on color-mapping by both observers. Overall, the average time-to-detection decreased from 37.0s to 19.4s (p<0.03) and the average accuracy of vessel occlusion detection increased from 0.825 to 0.85 with color-mapping.
                             CONCLUSION
                             Color-mapping of cerebral vasculature in 4D-CTA improves the speed and may improve the accuracy of the detection of vessel occlusions in acute stroke patients.},

In this database there is a large variety of patients observed in every day clinical practice. The method was trained on 19 4D CT images of patients with manual annotations by two trained medical assistants. Five subvolumes representing different regions of the cerebral vasculature were annotated in each image in the training set. The evaluation of the method was done on 242 patients. One out of fve subvolumes was randomly annotated in 159 patients and was used for quantitative evaluation. Segmentations were inspected visually for the entire study cohort to assess failures. A total of 16 (<8%) patients showed severe under- or over-segmentation and were reported as failures. Quantitative evaluation in comparison to the reference annotation showed a Dice coeffcient of 0.91 +- 0.07 and a modiffed Hausdorff distance of 0.23 +- 0.22 mm, which is smaller than voxel spacing.},

  abstract = {Background
                             In case of carotid artery occlusion, the risk and extent of ischemic cerebral damage is highly dependent on the pathways of collateral flow, including the anatomy of the circle of Willis.
                             In this report, cases are presented to illustrate that {4D-CTA} can be considered as a noninvasive alternative to DSA for the evaluation of circle of Willis collateral flow.
                             Case Description
                             Five patients with unilateral internal carotid artery ({ICA}) occlusion underwent {4D-CTA} for the evaluation of intracranial hemodynamics. Next to a visual evaluation of {4D-CTA}, temporal information was visualized using a normalized color scale on the cerebral vasculature, which enabled quantification of the contrast bolus arrival time. In these patients, {4D-CTA} demonstrated dominant {MCA} blood supply on the side of {ICA} occlusion originating either from the contralateral {ICA} or from the posterior circulation via the communicating arteries.
                             Conclusions
                             Temporal dynamics of collateral flow in the circle of Willis can be depicted with {4D-CTA} in patients with a unilateral carotid artery occlusion.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: Segmentation of the complete cerebral vasculature in {4D-CTA} is important for improved visualization, automated pathology detection and assessment of the collateral flow. We present a deep learning approach to segment the complete cerebral vasculature in {4D-CTA} of patients with suspected stroke.
                             MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total 162 patients that underwent {4D-CTA} for suspicion of stroke were included in this study. The scans were acquired on a 320-detector row scanner (Canon Medical Systems Corporation, Japan). Image size was 512x512x320 voxels by 19 time points with isotropic voxel sizes of approximately 0.5 mm. A 3D fully convolutional neural network ({CNN}), U-Net, was proposed with integration of a spatial feature in the final convolutional layer of the network. The weighted temporal average and variance were derived from the 4D-CTA and used as input for the network. As spatial feature the Euclidean distance from the center of the brain to the skull was used. Training was done on 19 patients with manually annotated data. The remaining 143 patients were used as testing set. Segmentations were visually inspected for completeness and overall quality. Two observers manually annotated three dimensional sub-volumes throughout the brain to include different sized vessels for quantitative evaluation. The Dice similarity coefficient ({DSC}) and Mean Contour Distance ({MCD}) of the segmentations were reported.
                             RESULTS
                             Overall the method was capable of segmenting the complete cerebral vasculature. Smaller distal vessels (e.g. M3) showed similar segmentation results as the larger vessels (e.g. internal carotid artery). The {DSC} was 0.91+-0.08 and the {MCD} was 0.26+-0.24 mm which is below voxel spacing. Computation time was less than 90 seconds for processing a full {4D-CTA} data set.
                             CONCLUSION:
                             A 3D U-Net with spatial features provides fast, robust and accurate segmentations of the full cerebral vasculature in {4D-CTA}.

  title = {Color-mapping visualization of {4D-CTA} in neurovascular disease},
  booktitle = ESNR,
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {{PURPOSE}
                             Nowadays {4D-CTA} is available as a non-invasive alternative to conventional angiography, with reported high diagnostic accuracy in the evaluation of different neurovascular disorders, including arteriovenous shunts and collateral flow pathways. Optimized processing of {4D-CTA} is crucial, considering the large amount of data generated. Enhanced visualization of {4D-CTA} can be achieved by applying color-mapping of temporal information in the cerebral vasculature.
                             {METHOD AND MATERIALS}
                             Color-mapping processing of {4D-CTA} is achieved in two steps. First, the full cerebral vasculature is segmented by features extraction and random forest classification. Second, the color-scale is adjusted using the histogram using the histogram of the arrival times of the segmented vessels. Early contrast bolus arrival(e.g. healthy internal carotid artery) is labeled red, intermediate arrival yellow, and delayed contrast arrival is labeled blue.
                             Color-mapping of {4D-CTA} was applied in patients suspected of cranial arteriovenous shunts, and in patients with unilateral carotid artery occlusion for the evaluation of circle of Willis collateral flow. The patients were scanned on a wide-row 320 slice detector {CT} (Toshiba Aquilion {ONE}), enabling whole-head coverage at high temporal resolution.
                             {RESULTS}
                             Arterialization of venous vascular structures is the hallmark of arterio-venous shunts, which is easily and accurately identified on color-mapping of {4D-CTA}. Temporal dynamics of collateral flow in the circle of Willis is adequately depicted with {4D-CTA} in patients with unilateral carotid artery occlusion.
                             {CONCLUSION}
                             Color-mapping of {4D-CTA} accurately displays temporal information of the cerebral vasculature, which can facilitate the detection of arterio-venous shunts and the evaluation of collateral flow in intracranial steno-occlusive disease.},

  abstract = {Four-dimensional CT angiography ({4D-CTA}) is increasingly used in clinical practice for the assessment of different neurovascular disorders. Optimized processing of {4D-CTA} is crucial for diagnostic interpretation because of the large amount of data that is generated. A color-mapping method of {4D-CTA} is presented for improved and enhanced visualization of the cerebral vasculature hemodynamics. This method was applied to detect cranial AVFs. All patients who underwent both {4D-CTA} and {DSA} in our hospital in the period 2011-2018 for the clinical suspicion of a cranial {AVF} or caroticocavernous fistula ({CCF}) were retrospectively collected. Temporal information in the cerebral vasculature was visualized using a patient-specific color-scale. All color-maps were evaluated by three observers for the presence or absence of an {AVF} or {CCF}. The presence or absence of cortical venous reflux was evaluated as a secondary outcome measure. In total 31 patients were included, 21 patients with and 10 without an {AVF}. Arterialization of venous structures in {AVF}s was accurately visualized using color-mapping. There was high sensitivity (86-100%) and moderate-to-high specificity (70-100%) for the detection of AVFs on color-mapping {4D-CTA}, even without the availability of dynamic subtraction rendering. The diagnostic performance of the three observers in the detection of cortical venous reflux was variable (sensitivity 43-88%, specificity 60-80%). Arterialization of venous structures can be visualized using color mapping of {4D-CTA} and proves to be accurate for the detection of cranial {AVF}s. This makes color-mapping a promising visualization technique for assessing temporal hemodynamics in {4D-CTA}.},

In serious disorders, like an ischemic stroke the vessels in the brain are blocked or affected. A radiologist examines these complex scans looking for the disorder of blocked vessel. The goal of my research is to facilitate the assessment of these images and help doctor read these scans. Using image analysis methods, I have developed a technique that visualizes the flow in the blood vessels using a color-map. Through this, the abnormalities or blocked blood vessels become better visible. On top of this, I have developed a method using artificial intelligence that can automatically detect patients with an ischemic stroke, based on the 4-dimensional images. In the future, these and other algorithms can aid, and possibly take over the job of the radiologist, of examine these images.},

  abstract = {The triage of acute stroke patients is increasingly dependent on four-dimensional CTA (4D-CTA) imaging. In this work, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image-level detection of intracranial anterior circulation artery occlusions in 4D-CTA. The method uses a normalized 3D time-to-signal (TTS) representation of the input image, which is sensitive to differences in the global arrival times caused by the potential presence of vascular pathologies. The TTS map presents the time within the cranial cavity at which the signal reaches a percentage of the maximum signal intensity, corrected for the baseline intensity. The method was trained and validated on (n=214) patient images and tested on an independent set of (n=279) patient images. This test set included all consecutive suspected-stroke patients admitted to our hospital in 2018. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 92\%, 95\%, and 92\%. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.95- 0.99). These results show the feasibility of automated stroke triage in 4D-CTA.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To implement and test a deep learning approach for the segmentation of the arterial and venous cerebral vasculature with four-dimensional (4D) CT angiography. Materials and Methods: Patients who had undergone 4D CT angiography for the suspicion of acute ischemic stroke were retrospectively identified. A total of 390 patients evaluated in 2014 (n = 113) or 2018 (n = 277) were included in this study, with each patient having undergone one 4D CT angiographic scan. One hundred patients from 2014 were randomly selected, and the arteries and veins on their CT scans were manually annotated by five experienced observers. The weighted temporal average and weighted temporal variance from 4D CT angiography were used as input for a three-dimensional Dense-U-Net. The network was trained with the fully annotated cerebral vessel artery-vein maps from 60 patients. Forty patients were used for quantitative evaluation. The relative absolute volume difference and the Dice similarity coefficient are reported. The neural network segmentations from 277 patients who underwent scanning in 2018 were qualitatively evaluated by an experienced neuroradiologist using a five-point scale. Results: The average time for processing arterial and venous cerebral vasculature with the network was less than 90 seconds. The mean Dice similarity coefficient in the test set was 0.80 6 0.04 (standard deviation) for the arteries and 0.88 +- 0.03 for the veins. The mean relative absolute volume difference was 7.3% 6 5.7 for the arteries and 8.5% +- 4.8 for the veins. Most of the segmentations (n = 273, 99.3%) were rated as very good to perfect. Conclusion: The proposed convolutional neural network enables accurate artery and vein segmentation with 4D CT angiography with a processing time of less than 90 seconds.},

  abstract = {A dynamic-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) dataset consists of many imaging frames, often acquired both before and after contrast injection. Due to the length of time spent acquiring images, patient motion is likely and image re-alignment or registration is required before further analysis such as pharmacokinetic model fitting. Non-rigid image registration procedures may be used to correct motion artefacts; however, a careful choice of registration strategy is required to reduce misregistration artefacts associated with enhancing features. This work investigates the effect of registration on the results of model-fitting algorithms for 52 DCE-MR mammography cases for 14 patients. Results are divided into two sections: a comparison of registration strategies in which a DCE-MRI-specific algorithm is preferred in 50\% of cases, followed by an investigation of parameter changes with known applied deformations, inspecting the effect of magnitude and timing of motion artefacts. Increased motion magnitude correlates with increased model-fit residual and is seen to have a strong influence on the visibility of strongly enhancing features. Motion artefacts in images close to the contrast agent arrival have a disproportionate effect on discrepancies in parameter estimation. The choice of algorithm, magnitude of motion and timing of the motion are each shown to influence estimated pharmacokinetic parameters even when motion magnitude is small.},

In this paper, we investigate utilizing a CAD system based on a support vector machine classifier as a standalone tool for recalling additional abnormal cases missed at screening, while keeping the associated recall rate at low levels. We tested the system on a large database of 5800 cases containing abnormal instances (1%) corresponding to prior examinations missed at screening. The results showed that 26% of the missed cases could be detected with a low additional recall rate of 2%. Moreover, after extrapolating this result to a screening program, we determined that, with our system, 0.73 additional cancers per 20 additional recalls could be potentially detected. We also compared the proposed system with a regular CAD system intended for non-standalone operation. The performance of the proposed system was significantly better.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate a standalone computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the identification of suspicious non-referred cases. These cases could be submitted to a third reader for reconsideration. METHOD AND MATERIALS: We investigated a CAD system for mass detection consisting of three stages: pre-processing, initial detection and a final classification. In the pre-processing stage, the input image is segmented and enhanced. Next, suspicious regions are detected by an ensemble of five neural networks provided with five features based on spiculation and gradient measures. In the final stage, these candidate regions are assigned a malignancy score based on a richer set of 73 features that, in addition, measure contrast, location, linear texture, etc. For this final stage three different classifiers were evaluated: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), gentleboost with regression stumps and support vector machines (SVMs). The classifier parameters were optimized at a very low recall rate (2%), in contrast to previously proposed CAD systems, because we are interested in such a high specificity in order to minimize the reviewing effort for a possible third reader. The data for this study consisted of a set of 28,811 scanned film mammograms collected from different sites in the Netherlands. Of these, 740 images correspond to 266 malignant cases with visible masses and architectural distortions that were not detected until the next screening round (two years later). The remaining images correspond to 9,127 normal cases with no sign of pathology. A five fold cross-validation scheme was used to evaluate the system. Performance was assessed by mean case sensitivity obtained at 2% recall rate. Comparisons were made using bootstrap analysis. RESULTS: At a 2% additional recall rate, mean sensitivities achieved by LDA, gentleboost and SVM were 4.0%, 9.8%, and 10.5%, respectively. SVM and gentleboost performed significantly better than LDA. Using the best classifier, the CAD system was able to detect 28 (10.5%) previously missed cases for reconsideration. CONCLUSION: Automatic selection of non-referred suspicious cases for reconsideration using a standalone CAD system is feasible at low additional recall rates. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION:Using a CAD system that autonomously detects potentially missed cancers could substantially improve screening efficacy with only a small additional reading effort.},

  abstract = {Detection of tuberculosis (TB) on chest radiographs (CXRs) is a hard problem. Therefore, to help radiologists or even take their place when they are not available, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems are being developed. In order to reach a performance comparable to that of human experts, the pattern recognition algorithms of these systems are typically trained on large CXR databases that have been manually annotated to indicate the abnormal lung regions. However, manually outlining those regions constitutes a time-consuming process that, besides, is prone to inconsistencies and errors introduced by interobserver variability and the absence of an external reference standard. In this paper, we investigate an alternative pattern classification method, namely multiple-instance learning (MIL), that does not require such detailed information for a CAD system to be trained. We have applied this alternative approach to a CAD system aimed at detecting textural lesions associated with TB. Only the case (or image) condition (normal or abnormal) was provided in the training stage. We compared the resulting performance with those achieved by several variations of a conventional system trained with detailed annotations. A database of 917 CXRs was constructed for experimentation. It was divided into two roughly equal parts that were used as training and test sets. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was utilized as a performance measure. Our experiments show that, by applying the investigated MIL approach, comparable results as with the aforementioned conventional systems are obtained in most cases, without requiring condition information at the lesion level.},

  abstract = {In order to reach performance levels comparable to those of human experts, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems are typically optimized by means of a supervised learning approach that relies on large training databases comprising manually annotated lesions. However, manually outlining those lesions constitutes a difficult and time-consuming process that renders detailedly annotated data often difficult to obtain. In this paper, we investigate an alternative pattern classification approach, namely multiple-instance learning (MIL), that does not require such detailed information for a CAD system to be optimized. We have applied MIL to a CAD system aimed at detecting textural lesions associated with tuberculosis. Only the case (or image) condition (normal or abnormal), which was determined by radiological means, was required during training. Based upon the well-known miSVM technique, we propose a novel algorithm, specifically designed for our CAD application, that overcomes serious drawbacks of the former related to underestimation of the positive instances and costly iteration. The key of the proposed method is to use probability estimates instead of decision values to guide the MIL procedure. In addition, we include countermeasures that deal with the uncertainty resulting from instance relabeling. To show the advantages of our MIL-based approach as compared with a traditional supervised one, experiments with three different image databases were conducted. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was utilized as a performance measure. With the first database, for which training lesion annotations were available, the supervised system was not much better than our MILbased method (0:88 vs. 0:86). Thus, the proposed approach achieved highly competitive results without resorting to lesionlevel information and the associated annotation process. When evaluating the remaining databases, given their large difference with respect to the previous image set, the most appealing strategy to maintain good performance was to retrain the CAD systems considering the new data. However, since only the image condition was available in this case, only the MIL-based system could be retrained. This scenario, which is common in realworld applications, clearly demonstrates the better adaptation capabilities of the proposed approach. After retraining, our MILbased system significantly outperformed the supervised one (0:86 vs. 0:79 and 0:91 vs. 0:85, p < 0:0001 and p = 0:0002, respectively).},

  abstract = {Mass candidate detection is a crucial component of multistep computer-aided detection (CAD) systems. It is usually performed by combining several local features by means of a classifier. When these features are processed on a per-image-location basis (e.g., for each pixel), mismatching problems may arise while constructing feature vectors for classification, which is especially true when the behavior expected from the evaluated features is a peaked response due to the presence of a mass. In this study, two of these problems, consisting of maxima misalignment and differences of maxima spread, are identified and two solutions are proposed.The first proposed method, feature maxima propagation, reproduces feature maxima through their neighboring locations. The second method, local feature selection, combines different subsets of features for different feature vectors associated with image locations. Both methods are applied independently and together.The proposed methods are included in a mammogram-based CAD system intended for mass detection in screening. Experiments are carried out with a database of 382 digital cases. Sensitivity is assessed at two sets of operating points. The first one is the interval of 3.5-15 false positives per image (FPs/image), which is typical for mass candidate detection. The second one is 1 FP/image, which allows to estimate the quality of the mass candidate detector's output for use in subsequent steps of the CAD system. The best results are obtained when the proposed methods are applied together. In that case, the mean sensitivity in the interval of 3.5-15 FPs/image significantly increases from 0.926 to 0.958 (p < 0.0002). At the lower rate of 1 FP/image, the mean sensitivity improves from 0.628 to 0.734 (p < 0.0002).Given the improved detection performance, the authors believe that the strategies proposed in this paper can render mass candidate detection approaches based on image location classification more robust to feature discrepancies and prove advantageous not only at the candidate detection level, but also at subsequent steps of a CAD system.},

  abstract = {The major advantage of multiple-instance learning (MIL) applied to a computer-aided detection (CAD) system is that it allows optimizing the latter with case-level labels instead of accurate lesion outlines as traditionally required for a supervised approach. As shown in previous work, a MIL-based CAD system can perform comparably to its supervised counterpart considering complex tasks such as chest radiograph scoring in tuberculosis (TB) detection. However, despite this remarkable achievement, the uncertainty inherent to MIL can lead to a less satisfactory outcome if analysis at lower levels (e.g., regions or pixels) is needed. This issue may seriously compromise the applicability of MIL to tasks related to quantification or grading, or detection of highly localized lesions. In this paper, we propose to reduce uncertainty by embedding a MIL classifier within an active learning (AL) framework. To minimize the labeling effort, we develop a novel instance selection mechanism that exploits the MIL problem definition through one-class classification. We adapt this mechanism to provide meaningful regions instead of individual instances for expert labeling, which is a more appropriate strategy given the application domain. In addition, and contrary to usual AL methods, a single iteration is performed. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we compare the output of a MIL-based CAD system trained with and without the proposed AL framework. The task is to detect textural abnormalities related to TB. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations at the pixel level are carried out. In the former case, receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall analyses are used. For completeness, we also compare with a CAD system following a supervised approach and related baselines. The quantitative results show that the proposed method significantly improves the MIL-based classification and narrows the gap with the supervised approach in \%50 and \%75, depending on if 100 or 300 labeled regions are processed, but with only \%5 and \%16 of the labeling effort. In qualitative terms, a substantial improvement in lesion localization and false-positive detections is observed. The proposed method also outperforms the aforementioned baselines.},

  abstract = {Lack of human resources and radiological interpretation expertise impair tuberculosis (TB) screening programmes in TB-endemic countries. Computer-aided detection (CAD) constitutes a viable alternative for chest radiograph (CXR) reading. However, no automated techniques that exploit the additional clinical information typically available during screening exist. To address this issue and optimally exploit this information, a machine learning-based combination framework is introduced. We have evaluated this framework on a database containing 392 patient records from suspected TB subjects prospectively recruited in Cape Town, South Africa. Each record comprised a CAD score, automatically computed from a CXR, and 12 clinical features. Comparisons with strategies relying on either CAD scores or clinical information alone were performed. Our results indicate that the combination framework outperforms the individual strategies in terms of the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (0.84 versus 0.78 and 0.72), specificity at 95\% sensitivity (49\% versus 24\% and 31\%) and negative predictive value (98\% versus 95\% and 96\%). Thus, it is believed that combining CAD and clinical information to estimate the risk of active disease is a promising tool for TB screening.},

To compare the performance of automatic software (CAD4TB 5) in chest X-ray (CXR) reading with that of field (general practitioners) and central (radiologists) readers. A retrospective study comparing the performance of human and automatic reading was conducted. Two scenarios for central reading were evaluated: abnormalities not consistent with TB were considered to be 'normal' or 'abnormal'. Sputum culture was defined as the reference standard. Measures derived from receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to assess readers' performances. Of 46 099 participants, 23 838 cases included all survey information; of these, 106 cases were culture-confirmed TB-positive. The performance of CAD4TB 5 was similar to that of field and central readers. Although there were significant differences in specificity when compared with field readings (P = 0.002) and central readings considering the first scenario (P < 0.001), these differences were not substantial (93.2% vs. 92.6% and 98.4% vs. 99.6%, respectively).CONCLUSIONp: The performance of automatic CXR readings is comparable with that of human experts in a TB prevalence survey setting using culture as reference.},

Despite efforts to develop new TB diagnostics, screening is still commonly performed using chest radiography, followed by sputum culture, Xpert (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) testing or smear microscopy. Early studies reported limited specificity and variable levels of inter- and intra-reader agreement in interpreting chest radiographs (CXRs) for TB detection.

One hundred forty-seven patients (age range, 11-101 years; mean, 51.4 years +/- 18.7 [standard deviation]) suspected of having urinary stone disease underwent unenhanced multi-detector row CT. CT was performed with four detector rows, a section thickness of 1.0 mm, an effective tube current-time product of 100 mAs, and a tube voltage of 120 kVp (CT dose index, 11.4 mGy). From these data, three sets of transverse images were reconstructed with section widths of 1.5, 3.0, and 5.0 mm and approximately 50\% of overlap each. Scans were evaluated in varying random orders by two radiologists for the number, size, and location of uroliths and nephroliths and for the presence of phleboliths, renal cysts, and secondary signs of obstruction. The significance of differences between the numbers of detected calcifications and the numbers of associated abnormalities on the scans obtained with varying section widths was tested with the McNemar test at a P level of less than .05. Spearman rho rank correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the correlation between the presence of uroliths and the presence of secondary signs.Uroliths were found in 72 of 147 (49.0\%) patients, and nephroliths were found in 16 patients (10.9\%). There was no significant difference between section widths of 1.5 and 3.0 mm with regard to the number of detected stones (264 uroliths and 61 nephroliths for both protocols). Transverse sections 5.0-mm wide revealed significantly fewer uroliths (n = 231; P < .001) and nephroliths (n = 47; P < .016). The final diagnosis was changed in four of 72 patients. All missed renal and ureteral stones measured less than 3 mm in diameter.Overlapping 3-mm sections are sufficient for the detection of urinary stone disease. Small calculi (<3 mm) may be missed on 5.0-mm-thick sections.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: CT angiography (CTA) scans are the current standard for vascular analysis of patients with cerebrovascular diseases, such as acute stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage. An additional CT perfusion (CTP) scan is acquired of these patients to assess the perfusion of the cerebral tissue. The aim of this study is to extend the diagnostic yield of the CTP scans to also include vascular information. METHODS: CTP scans are acquired by injecting contrast material and repeatedly scanning the head over time. Therefore, time-intensity profiles are available for each voxel in the scanned volume, resulting in a 4D dataset. These profiles can be utilized to differentiate not only between vessels and background but also between arteries and veins. In this article, a fully automatic method is proposed for the segmentation of the intracranial arteries and veins from 4D cerebral CTP scans. Furthermore, a vessel enhanced volume is presented, in which the vasculature is highlighted and background structures are suppressed. Combining this volume with the artery/vein segmentation results in an arteriogram and a venogram, which could serve as additional means for vascular analysis in patients with cerebrovascular diseases. The artery/vein segmentation is quantitatively evaluated by comparing the results to manual segmentations by two expert observers. RESULTS: Results (paired two-tailed t-test) show that the accuracies of the proposed artery/vein labeling are not significantly different from the accuracies of the expert observer manual labeling (ground truth). Moreover, sensitivity and specificity of the proposed artery/vein labeling, relative to both expert observer ground truths, were similar to the sensitivity and specificity of the expert observer labeling compared to each other. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method for artery/vein segmentation is shown to be very accurate for arteries and veins with normal perfusion. Combining the artery/vein segmentation with the vessel enhanced volume produces an arteriogram and a venogram, which have the potential to extend the diagnostic yield of CTP scans and replace the additional CTA scan, but could also be helpful to radiologists in addition to the CTA scan.},

  abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) uses X-ray radiation to construct images. Applying X-ray radiation to the human body may damage the tissue and increases the risk of inducing cancer. Therefore, the radiation dose should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). This is especially true for 4D CT perfusion (CTP) scans, since these scans consist of multiple sequential 3D CT scans over time. Therefore, not much radiation dose can be used per sequential scan. However, lowering the radiation dose increases the amount of noise in CT scans and therefore decreases image quality. This thesis describes two ways of dealing with radiation dose reduction in terms of image processing: 1) Image processing techniques can be utilized to extract as much information as possible from one CT scan, obviating the need for additional CT scans, therefore reducing radiation dose. Chapter 2 describes a method to automatically derive vascular information from 4D CTP scans and separate the arteries from the veins. The resulting CTP-derived arteriogram and venogram have the potential to replace the CT angiography (CTA) scan that is routinely acquired in addition to the CTP scan to assess the arteries. In Chapter 3 the quality of the arteriograms derived from the CTP data is evaluated by comparing them with standard CTA scans. The CTP-derived arteriograms provide improved visualization of the Circle of Willis arteries compared to standard CTA, due to effective suppression of superimposing structures such as veins, bone and subarachnoid blood. 2) Image processing techniques can be utilized to reduce the noise that is introduced by minimizing the radiation dose. In Chapter 4 an anisotropic diffusion method is described, entitled hybrid diffusion with continuous switch (HDCS), for reducing noise in 3D CT scans while preserving edges, tubular structures, and small spherical structures. Chapter 5 describes a bilateral noise reduction method, entitled time-intensity profile similarity (TIPS) bilateral filtering, for filtering noise from 4D CTP scans, while preserving the time-intensity profiles that are important for perfusion analysis. This filter improves the quality of cerebral perfusion maps derived from the CTP data, which are used to detect areas of abnormal perfusion in the brain. Chapter 6 describes an anisotropic diffusion method to reduce noise in 4D CTP scans that combines the HDCS filter proposed in Chapter 4 with the TIPS measure proposed in Chapter 5, using the 4th dimension to distinguish between structures. This filter enhances vessels, while reducing noise in 4D CTP scans and was evaluated by deriving arteriograms and venograms from the filtered CTP data. These arteriograms and venograms showed reduced background noise and improved visualization of small arteries and veins. The last chapter of this thesis describes how the methods proposed in this thesis can be used in future applications.},

  abstract = {Cerebral computed tomography perfusion (CTP) scans are acquired to detect areas of abnormal perfusion in patients with cerebrovascular diseases. These 4D CTP scans consist ofmultiple sequential 3D CT scans over time. Therefore, to reduce radiation exposure to the patient, the amount of x-ray radiation that can be used per sequential scan is limited, which results in a high level of noise. To detect areas of abnormal perfusion, perfusion parameters are derived from the CTP data, such as the cerebral blood flow (CBF). Algorithms to determine perfusion parameters, especially singular value decomposition, are very sensitive to noise. Therefore, noise reduction is an important preprocessing step for CTP analysis. In this paper, we propose a time-intensity profile similarity (TIPS) bilateral filter to reduce noise in 4D CTP scans, while preserving the time-intensity profiles (fourth dimension) that are essential for determining the perfusion parameters. The proposed TIPS bilateral filter is compared to standard Gaussian filtering, and 4D and 3D (applied separately to each sequential scan) bilateral filtering on both phantom and patient data. Results on the phantom data show that the TIPS bilateral filter is best able to approach the ground truth (noise-free phantom), compared to the other filtering methods (lowest root mean square error). An observer study is performed using CBF maps derived from fifteen CTP scans of acute stroke patients filtered with standard Gaussian, 3D, 4D and TIPS bilateral filtering. These CBF maps were blindly presented to two observers that indicated which map they preferred for (1) gray/white matter differentiation, (2) detectability of infarcted area and (3) overall image quality. Based on these results, the TIPS bilateral filter ranked best and its CBF maps were scored to have the best overall image quality in 100% of the cases by both observers. Furthermore, quantitative CBF and cerebral blood volume values in both the phantom and the patient data showed that the TIPS bilateral filter resulted in realistic mean values with a smaller standard deviation than the other evaluated filters and higher contrast-to-noise ratios. Therefore, applying the proposed TIPS bilateral filtering method to 4D CTP data produces higher quality CBF maps than applying the standard Gaussian, 3D bilateral or 4D bilateral filter. Furthermore, the TIPS bilateral filter is computationally faster than both the 3D and 4D bilateral filters.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:Invasive cerebral DSA has largely been replaced by CTA, which is noninvasive but has a compromised arterial view due to superimposed bone and veins. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether arterial visualization in CTPa is superior to standard CTA, which would eliminate the need for an additional CTA scan to assess arterial diseases and therefore reduce radiation dose.MATERIALS AND METHODS:In this study, we included 24 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage for whom CTA and CTP were available. Arterial quality and presence of superimposed veins and bone in CTPa were compared with CTA and scored by 2 radiologists by using a VAS (0\%-100\%). Average VAS scores were determined and VAS scores per patient were converted to a 10-point NRS. Arterial visualization was considered to be improved when the highest rate (NRS 10, VAS > 90\%) was scored for arterial quality, and the lowest rate (NRS 1, VAS < 10\%), for the presence of superimposed veins and bone. A sign test with continuity correction was used to test whether the number of cases with these rates was significant.RESULTS:Average VAS scores in the proximal area were 94\% (arterial quality), 4\% (presence of bone), and 7\% (presence of veins). In this area, the sign test showed that a significant number of cases scored NRS 10 for arterial quality (P < .02) and NRS 1 for the presence of superimposed veins and bone (P < .01).CONCLUSIONS:Cerebral CTPa shows improved arterial visualization in the proximal area compared with CTA, with similar arterial quality but no superimposed bone and veins.},

  title = {Grading nuclear pleomorphism in breast cancer using deep learning},
  booktitle = ECP,
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {Nuclear pleomorphism is defined as the variability in size and shape of tumor cells as compared to normal epithelial cells. Objective of this study is to train a deep neural network that can achieve pathologist-level pleomorphism grading performance. We collected 29 whole slide images (WSI) of breast cancer resections in which we manually selected 90 regions of interest, ensuring grade homogeneity of tumour cells within a region. Subsequently, we cropped regions of ~0.38 mm2 at 40X magnification (0.25 um/px) and asked six pathologists to grade each region independently. We used an epithelial cell detector network to detect the epithelial cells in each region and extracted fixed-size patches from these regions with high tumor density. For the task of pleomorphism grading, we trained a densenet model on those patches with the majority voting of the grades of the pathologists (majority grades). The variation of kappa scores of the pathologists with the majority grade was very high, ranging between 0.37 and 0.69 on the standalone test set consisting of 18 regions from 7 WSI. On the same test set, our densenet model had a kappa score of 0.47 with the majority grades. We demonstrated that our network trained only on tumor cells achieved performance on the task of pleomorphism grading of breast cancer around the low mid-range of the inter-pathologist variability where the inter-observer variability of pathologists was very high. Future research will include scores of a larger panel of pathologists, and study alternative deep learning strategies to improve the performance.},

  abstract = {X-ray mammography is routinely used in national screening programmes and as a clinical diagnostic tool. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is commonly used as a complementary modality, providing functional information about the breast and a 3D image that can overcome ambiguities caused by the superimposition of fibro-glandular structures associated with X-ray imaging. Relating findings between these modalities is a challenging task however, due to the different imaging processes involved and the large deformation that the breast undergoes. In this work we present a registration method to determine spatial correspondence between pairs of MR and X-ray images of the breast, that is targeted for clinical use. We propose a generic registration framework which incorporates a volume-preserving affine transformation model and validate its performance using routinely acquired clinical data. Experiments on simulated mammograms from 8 volunteers produced a mean registration error of 3.8A-A?A 1/2 1.6mm for a mean of 12 manually identified landmarks per volume. When validated using 57 lesions identified on routine clinical CC and MLO mammograms (n=113 registration tasks) from 49 subjects the median registration error was 13.1mm. When applied to the registration of an MR image to CC and MLO mammograms of a patient with a localisation clip, the mean error was 8.9mm. The results indicate that an intensity based registration algorithm, using a relatively simple transformation model, can provide radiologists with a clinically useful tool for breast cancer diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Women that are diagnosed with breast cancer often undergo surgery to remove either the tumour and some of the surrounding tissue (lumpectomy) or the whole breast (mastectomy). After surgery, the excised tissue is sliced at the pathology department, where specimen radiographs of the slices are typically acquired. Representative parts of the tissue are then sampled for further processing, staining and examination under the microscope. The results of histopathological imaging are used for tumour characterisation. As the 3D structure of the specimen is inevitably lost during specimen handling, reconstructing a volume from individual specimen slices could facilitate the correlation of histology to radiological imaging. This work proposes a novel method for a whole specimen volume reconstruction and is validated on six mastectomy cases. We also demonstrate how these volumes can be used as a means to map multiple histology slides to a whole mastectomy image (MRI or CT).},

  abstract = {PURPOSE:
                             In breast imaging, radiological in vivo images, such as x-ray mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are used for tumor detection, diagnosis, and size determination. After excision, the specimen is typically sliced into slabs and a small subset is sampled. Histopathological imaging of the stained samples is used as the gold standard for characterization of the tumor microenvironment. A 3D volume reconstruction of the whole specimen from the 2D slabs could facilitate bridging the gap between histology and in vivo radiological imaging. This task is challenging, however, due to the large deformation that the breast tissue undergoes after surgery and the significant undersampling of the specimen obtained in histology. In this work, we present a method to reconstruct a coherent 3D volume from 2D digital radiographs of the specimen slabs.

                             METHODS:
                             To reconstruct a 3D breast specimen volume, we propose the use of multiple target neighboring slices, when deforming each 2D slab radiograph in the volume, rather than performing pairwise registrations. The algorithm combines neighborhood slice information with free-form deformations, which enables a flexible, nonlinear deformation to be computed subject to the constraint that a coherent 3D volume is obtained. The neighborhood information provides adequate constraints, without the need for any additional regularization terms.

                             RESULTS:
                             The volume reconstruction algorithm is validated on clinical mastectomy samples using a quantitative assessment of the volume reconstruction smoothness and a comparison with a whole specimen 3D image acquired for validation before slicing. Additionally, a target registration error of 5 mm (comparable to the specimen slab thickness of 4 mm) was obtained for five cases. The error was computed using manual annotations from four observers as gold standard, with interobserver variability of 3.4 mm. Finally, we illustrate how the reconstructed volumes can be used to map histology images to a 3D specimen image of the whole sample (either MRI or CT).

                             CONCLUSIONS:
                             Qualitative and quantitative assessment has illustrated the benefit of using our proposed methodology to reconstruct a coherent specimen volume from serial slab radiographs. To our knowledge, this is the first method that has been applied to clinical breast cases, with the goal of reconstructing a whole specimen sample. The algorithm can be used as part of the pipeline of mapping histology images to ex vivo and ultimately in vivo radiological images of the breast.},

  abstract = {Context: Smoking is a major risk factor for both cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Computed tomography (CT)-based lung cancer screening may provide an opportunity to detect additional individuals with COPD at an early stage. Objective: To determine whether low-dose lung cancer screening CT scans can be used to identify participants with COPD. Design, Setting, and Patients: Single-center prospective cross-sectional study within an ongoing lung cancer screening trial. Prebronchodilator pulmonary function testing with inspiratory and expiratory CT on the same day was obtained from 1140 male participants between July 2007 and September 2008. Computed tomographic emphysema was defined as percentage of voxels less than -950 Hounsfield units (HU), and CT air trapping was defined as the expiratory:inspiratory ratio of mean lung density. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was defined as the ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) of less than 70%. Logistic regression was used to develop a diagnostic prediction model for airflow limitation. Main Outcome Measures: Diagnostic accuracy of COPD diagnosis using pulmonary function tests as the reference standard. Results: Four hundred thirty-seven participants (38%) had COPD according to lung function testing. A diagnostic model with CT emphysema, CT air trapping, body mass index, pack-years, and smoking status corrected for overoptimism (internal validation) yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81-0.86). Using the point of optimal accuracy, the model identified 274 participants with COPD with 85 false-positives, a sensitivity of 63% (95% CI, 58%-67%), specificity of 88% (95% CI, 85%-90%), positive predictive value of 76% (95% CI, 72%-81%); and negative predictive value of 79% (95% CI, 76%-82%). The diagnostic model showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.86-0.88) for participants with symptoms and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.76-0.80) for those without symptoms. Conclusion: Among men who are current and former heavy smokers, low-dose inspiratory and expiratory CT scans obtained for lung cancer screening can identify participants with COPD, with a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 88%},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between lung function impairment and quantitative computed tomography (CT) measurements of air trapping and emphysema in a population of current and former heavy smokers with and without airflow limitation. METHODS: In 248 subjects (50 normal smokers; 50 mild obstruction; 50 moderate obstruction; 50 severe obstruction; 48 very severe obstruction) CT emphysema and CT air trapping were quantified on paired inspiratory and end-expiratory CT examinations using several available quantification methods. CT measurements were related to lung function (FEV(1), FEV(1)/FVC, RV/TLC, Kco) by univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Quantitative CT measurements of emphysema and air trapping were strongly correlated to airflow limitation (univariate r-squared up to 0.72, p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, the combination of CT emphysema and CT air trapping explained 68-83\% of the variability in airflow limitation in subjects covering the total range of airflow limitation (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of quantitative CT air trapping and emphysema measurements is strongly associated with lung function impairment in current and former heavy smokers with a wide range of airflow limitation. KEY POINTS: - CT helps to automatically assess lung disease in heavy smokers - CT quantitatively measures emphysema and small airways disease in heavy smokers - CT air trapping and CT emphysema are associated with lung function impairment.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease that is characterized by chronic airflow limitation. Unraveling of this heterogeneity is challenging but important, because it might enable more accurate diagnosis and treatment. Because spirometry cannot distinguish between the different contributing pathways of airflow limitation, and visual scoring is time-consuming and prone to observer variability, other techniques are sought to start this phenotyping process. Quantitative computed tomography (CT) is a promising technique, because current CT technology is able to quantify emphysema, air trapping, and large airway wall dimensions. This review focuses on CT quantification techniques of COPD disease components and their current status and role in phenotyping COPD.},

Visual and quantitative scores of emphysema and air trapping were obtained. On CT, emphysema was defined as the 15th percentile of the attenuation curve (Perc(15)), and as the percentage of inspiratory voxels below -950 (IN(-950)) and below -960 (IN(-960)) HU.

Means, medians, and upper limits of normal (ULN) are presented for the total population and for smokers and nonsmokers separately.The mean age (A-A?A 1/2  SD) of the subjects was 36.1 A-A?A 1/2  9.3 years. Smoking history was limited (range, 0-11 pack-years). Spirometry was high normal, ranging from 113\% to 160\% of predicted for vital capacity (VC), and from 104\% to 140\% of predicted for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)). The ULN was 2.73\% for IN(-950), 0.87\% for IN(-960), -936 HU for Perc(15), 89.0\% for EI-ratio(MLD), and 17.2\% for EXP(-856).Visual CT scores showed minimal emphysema in eight (11\%), > 5 lobules of air trapping in five (7\%), and segmental air trapping in three (4\%) subjects. CT measures were similar for never- and ever-smokers.We report the normal range of CT values for young male subjects with normal lung function, which is important to define pulmonary disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND : Lung cancer screening CT scans might provide valuable information about air trapping as an early indicator of smoking-related lung disease. We studied which of the currently suggested measures is most suitable for detecting functionally relevant air trapping on low-dose computed tomography (CT) in a population of subjects with early-stage disease. METHODS : This study was ethically approved and informed consent was obtained. Three quantitative CT air trapping measures were compared against a functional reference standard in 427 male lung cancer screening participants. This reference standard for air trapping was derived from the residual volume over total lung capacity ratio (RV/TLC) beyond the 95th percentile of predicted. The following CT air trapping measures were compared: expiratory to inspiratory relative volume change of voxels with attenuation values between -860 and -950 Hounsfield Units (RVC(-860 to -950)), expiratory to inspiratory ratio of mean lung density (E/I-ratio(MLD)) and percentage of voxels below -856 HU in expiration (EXP(-856)). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed and area under the ROC curve compared. RESULTS: Functionally relevant air trapping was present in 38 (8.9 \%) participants. E/I-ratio(MLD) showed the largest area under the curve (0.85, 95 \% CI 0.813-0.883), which was significantly larger than RVC(-860 to -950) (0.703, 0.657-0.746; p < 0.001) and EXP(-856) (0.798, 0.757-0.835; p = 0.002). At the optimum for sensitivity and specificity, E/I-ratio(MLD) yielded an accuracy of 81.5 \%. CONCLUSIONS: The expiratory to inspiratory ratio of mean lung density (E/I-ratio(MLD)) is most suitable for detecting air trapping on low-dose screening CT and performs significantly better than other suggested quantitative measures.},

Spirometry was obtained at baseline and after 3 years. The expiratory to inspiratory ratio of mean lung density (E/I-ratioMLD) was used to quantify air trapping.

Linear mixed modeling was used to determine the association between CT air trapping and lung function.We included 985 subjects with a mean age of 61.3 years. Independent of CT emphysema, CT air trapping was significantly associated with a reduction in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the ratio of FEV1 over the forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC); FEV1 declines with 33 mL per percent increase in CT air trapping, while FEV1/FVC declines 0.58\% per percent increase (both p<0.001). CT air trapping further elicits accelerated loss of FEV1/FVC (additional 0.24\% reduction per percent increase; pAC/a,!A =AC/a,!A 0.014).In a lung cancer screening cohort, quantitatively assessed air trapping on low-dose CT is independently associated with reduced lung function and accelerated decline of FEV1/FVC.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Beyond lung cancer, screening CT contains additional information on other smoking related diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD). Since pulmonary function testing is not regularly incorporated in lung cancer screening, imaging biomarkers for COPD are likely to provide important surrogate measures for disease evaluation. Therefore, this study aims to determine the independent diagnostic value of CT emphysema, CT air trapping and CT bronchial wall thickness for COPD in low-dose screening CT scans. METHODS: Prebronchodilator spirometry and volumetric inspiratory and expiratory chest CT were obtained on the same day in 1140 male lung cancer screening participants. Emphysema, air trapping and bronchial wall thickness were automatically quantified in the CT scans. Logistic regression analysis was performed to derivate a model to diagnose COPD. The model was internally validated using bootstrapping techniques. RESULTS: Each of the three CT biomarkers independently contributed diagnostic value for COPD, additional to age, body mass index, smoking history and smoking status. The diagnostic model that included all three CT biomarkers had a sensitivity and specificity of 73.2\% and 88.\%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive value were 80.2\% and 84.2\%, respectively. Of all participants, 82.8\% was assigned the correct status. The C-statistic was 0.87, and the Net Reclassification Index compared to a model without any CT biomarkers was 44.4\%. However, the added value of the expiratory CT data was limited, with an increase in Net Reclassification Index of 4.5\% compared to a model with only inspiratory CT data. CONCLUSION: Quantitatively assessed CT emphysema, air trapping and bronchial wall thickness each contain independent diagnostic information for COPD, and these imaging biomarkers might prove useful in the absence of lung function testing and may influence lung cancer screening strategy. Inspiratory CT biomarkers alone may be sufficient to identify patients with COPD in lung cancer screening setting.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to derivate and validate a prediction model for cardiovascular events based on quantification of coronary and aortic calcium volume in lung cancer screening chest computed tomography (CT). BACKGROUND: CT-based lung cancer screening in heavy smokers is a very timely topic. Given that the heavily smoking screening population is also at risk for cardiovascular disease, CT-based screening may provide the opportunity to additionally identify participants at high cardiovascular risk. METHODS: Inspiratory screening CT of the chest was obtained in 3,648 screening participants. Next, smoking characteristics, patient demographics, and physician-diagnosed cardiovascular events were collected from 10 years before the screening CT (i.e., cardiovascular history) until 3 years after the screening CT (i.e., follow-up time). Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to derivate and validate a prediction model for cardiovascular risk. Age, smoking status, smoking history, and cardiovascular history, together with automatically quantified coronary and aortic calcium volume from the screening CT, were included as independent predictors. The primary outcome measure was the discriminatory value of the model. RESULTS: Incident cardiovascular events occurred in 145 of 1,834 males (derivation cohort) and 118 of 1,725 males and 2 of 89 females (validation cohort). The model showed good discrimination in the validation cohort with a C-statistic of 0.71 (95\% confidence interval: 0.67 to 0.76). When high risk was defined as a 3-year risk of 6\% and higher, 589 of 1,725 males were regarded as high risk and 72 of 118 of all events were correctly predicted by the model. CONCLUSIONS: Quantification of coronary and aortic calcium volumes in lung cancer screening CT images-information that is readily available-can be used to predict cardiovascular risk. Such an approach might prove useful in the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and may enhance the cost-effectiveness of CT-based screening in heavy smokers.},

An online questionnaire with four imaging cases was sent to 1579 associates from the European Respiratory Society and 757 from the European Society of Thoracic Imaging. Each respondent was asked to choose from several options which one they thought was the indicated management for the nodule presented. Awareness and conformance to the Fleischner recommendations (FR) were assessed and correlated to respondents characteristics. In total, 119 radiologists (response rate 16.0%) and 243 pulmonologists (response rate 16.5%) were included. Awareness of the FR was higher in radiologists than in pulmonologists (93% vs. 70%, p<0.001), as was implementation in daily practice (66% vs. 47%, p<0.001). Radiologists conformed to FR in rates of 31, 69, 68, and 82%, and pulmonologists in 12, 43, 70, and 75% for cases 1 to 4, respectively. Overmanagement was common. Conformance in SSN management was associated with awareness, working in an academic practice, larger practice size, teaching residents, and higher SSN exposure. Although awareness of the Fleischner recommendations for SSN management is widespread, management choices in clinical practice show large heterogeneity.Guideline awareness among clinicians is widespread, but conformance shows large heterogeneity. Awareness and conformance is significantly higher among radiologists than pulmonologists. Overmanagement is common, which may lead to avoidable financial and physical burden.},

All non-calcified nodules >= 4 mm were semi-automatically annotated. Lung cancer location and subject characteristics were recorded. Cases (56 % male) had a median age of 64 years (IQR 59-70). Controls (60 % male) were slightly younger (p<0.01), median age of 61 years (IQR 51-70). A total of 262/1,278 (21 %) unique non-calcified nodules represented a PFN. None of these were traced to a lung malignancy over a median follow-up of around 4.5 years. PFNs were most often located in the lower lung zones (72 %, p<0.001). Median diameter was 4.6 mm (range: 4.0-8.1), volume 51 mm3 (range: 32-278). Some showed growth rates < 400 days. Our data show that incidental PFNs do not represent lung cancer in a routine care, heterogeneous population. This confirms prior screening-based results. * One-fifth of non-calcified nodules represented a perifissural nodule in our non-screening population. * PFNs fairly often show larger size, and can show interval growth. * When morphologically resembling a PFN, nodules are nearly certainly not a malignancy. * The assumed benign aetiology of PFNs seems valid outside the screening setting.},

However, this is a theory that has never been validated in vivo in the routine-care target population. This study evaluates growth patterns of untreated solid and subsolid lung cancers of various histologies in a non-screening setting.Growth behaviour of pathology-proven lung cancers from two academic centres that were imaged at least three times before diagnosis (n=60) was analysed using dedicated software. Random-intercept random-slope mixed-models analysis was applied to test which growth pattern most accurately described lung cancer growth. Individual growth curves were plotted per pathology subgroup and nodule type.We confirmed that growth in both subsolid and solid lung cancers is best explained by an exponential model. However, subsolid lesions generally progress slower than solid ones. Baseline lesion volume was not related to growth, indicating that smaller lesions do not grow slower compared to larger ones.By showing that lung cancer conforms to exponential growth we provide the first experimental basis in the routine-care setting for the assumption made in volume doubling time analysis.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective: Accurate and reliable segmentation of the prostate gland in MR images can support the clinical assessment of prostate cancer, as well as the planning and monitoring of focal and loco-regional therapeutic interventions. Despite the availability of multi-planar MR scans due to standardized protocols, the majority of segmentation approaches presented in the literature consider the axial scans only. Methods: We propose an anisotropic 3D multi-stream CNN architecture, which processes additional scan directions to produce a higher-resolution isotropic prostate segmentation. We investigate two variants of our architecture, which work on two (dual-plane) and three (triple-plane) image orientations, respectively. We compare them with the standard baseline (single-plane) used in literature, i.e., plain axial segmentation. To realize a fair comparison, we employ a hyperparameter optimization strategy to select optimal configurations for the individual approaches. Results: Training and evaluation on two datasets spanning multiple sites obtain statistical significant improvement over the plain axial segmentation ($p<0.05$ on the Dice similarity coefficient). The improvement can be observed especially at the base ($0.898$ single-plane vs. $0.906$ triple-plane) and apex ($0.888$ single-plane vs. $0.901$ dual-plane). Conclusion: This study indicates that models employing two or three scan directions are superior to plain axial segmentation. The knowledge of precise boundaries of the prostate is crucial for the conservation of risk structures. Thus, the proposed models have the potential to improve the outcome of prostate cancer diagnosis and therapies.},

The influence of additional information used by these models is evaluated by comparing them with a single-plane baseline processing only axial images. To realize a fair comparison, we employ a hyperparameter optimization strategy to select optimal configurations for the individual approaches. Results: Training and evaluation on two datasets spanning multiple sites show statistical significant improvement over the plain axial segmentation (on the Dice similarity coefficient). The improvement can be observed especially at the base (0.898 single-plane vs. 0.906 triple-plane) and apex (0.888 single-plane vs. 0.901 dual-plane). Conclusion: This study indicates that models employing two or three scan directions are superior to plain axial segmentation. The knowledge of precise boundaries of the prostate is crucial for the conservation of risk structures. Thus, the proposed models have the potential to improve the outcome of prostate cancer diagnosis and therapies.},

  abstract = {Background Emphysema and small airway disease both contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease characterised by accelerated decline in lung function. The association between the extent of emphysema in male current and former smokers and lung function decline was investigated. Methods Current and former heavy smokers participating in a lung cancer screening trial were recruited to the study and all underwent CT. Spirometry was performed at baseline and at 3-year follow-up. The 15th percentile (Perc15) was used to assess the severity of emphysema. Results 2085 men of mean age 59.8 years participated in the study. Mean (SD) baseline Perc15 was -934.9 (19.5) HU. A lower Perc15 value correlated with a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) at baseline (r=0.12, p<0.001). Linear mixed model analysis showed that a lower Perc15 was significantly related to a greater decline in FEV(1) after follow-up (p<0.001). Participants without baseline airway obstruction who developed it after follow-up had significantly lower mean (SD) Perc15 values at baseline than those who did not develop obstruction (-934.2 (17.1) HU vs -930.2 (19.7) HU, p<0.001). Conclusion Greater baseline severity of CT-detected emphysema is related to lower baseline lung function and greater rates of lung function decline, even in those without airway obstruction. CT-detected emphysema aids in identifying non-obstructed male smokers who will develop airflow obstruction.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of length of smoking cessation and clinical / demographical factors on the rate of emphysema progression and FEV1-decline in male heavy smokers. METHODS: 3,670 male smokers with mean (SD) 40.8 (17.9) packyears underwent chest CT scans and pulmonary function tests at baseline and after 1 and 3 years follow-up. Smoking status (quitted >=5, >=1-<5, <1 years or current smoker) was noted. Rate of progression of emphysema and FEV1-decline after follow-up were assessed by analysis of variance adjusting for age, height, baseline pulmonary function and emphysema severity, packyears, years in study and respiratory symptoms. The quitted >=5 group was used as reference. RESULTS: Median (Q1-Q3) emphysema severity,<-950 HU, was 8.8 (5.1 -- 14.1) and mean (SD) FEV1 was 3.4 (0.73) L or 98.5 (18.5) \% of predicted. The group quitted '>5 years' showed significantly lower rates of progression of emphysema compared to current smokers, 1.07\% and 1.12\% per year, respectively (p<0.001). Current smokers had a yearly FEV1-decline of 69 ml, while subjects quit smoking >5 years had a yearly decline of 57.5 ml (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Quit smoking >5 years significantly slows the rate of emphysema progression and lung function decline.Trial registration: Registered at www.trialregister.nl with trial number ISRCTN63545820.},

All three can be quantified by computed tomography (CT) of the chest. The goal of the current study is to determine the relative contribution of CT derived parameters on spirometry, lung volume and lung diffusion testing. Emphysema, airway wall thickening and air trapping were quantified automatically on CT in 1,138 male smokers with and without COPD. Emphysema was quantified by the percentage of voxels below -950 Hounsfield Units (HU), airway wall thickness by the square root of wall area for a theoretical airway with 10 mm lumen perimeter (Pi10) and air trapping by the ratio of mean lung density at expiration and inspiration (E/I-ratio). Spirometry, residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/TLC) and diffusion capacity (Kco) were obtained. Standardized regression coefficients (AZA2) were used to analyze the relative contribution of CT changes to pulmonary function measures. The independent contribution of the three CT measures differed per lung function parameter. For the FEV1 airway wall thickness was the most contributing structural lung change (AZA2 = -0.46), while for the FEV1/FVC this was emphysema (AZA2 = -0.55). For the residual volume (RV) air trapping was most contributing (AZA2 = -0.35). Lung diffusion capacity was most influenced by emphysema (AZA2 = -0.42). In a cohort of smokers with and without COPD the effect of different CT changes varies per lung function measure and therefore emphysema, airway wall thickness and air trapping need to be taken in account.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Purpose: Emphysema quantification with computed tomography is known to be affected by variations in scanner type, scan protocol and proprietary reconstruction algorithms from manufacturers. We investigated if automatic calibration of density values based on per scan measurements in air outside the body or in the trachea reduced variability between emphysema scores from similar populations examined in a multi-center study. Method and materials: Three cohorts of heavy smokers, 500 subjects each, were randomly taken from lung cancer screening trials in two cities in The Netherlands and one in Denmark. Inclusion criteria, age, smoking history and lung function were comparable. Cohort A was scanned at full inspiration with 16 x 0.75 collimation with a Philips Brilliance scanner, low dose acquisition, reconstructed with a Philips B kernel to 1.0 mm section with 0.7 mm increment. Settings for the other cohorts were similar except that Cohort B was scanned with 1.0 mm increment and a Philips D kernel, and Cohort C was scanned with Siemens Sensation 16 and 64 scanners with a B30 kernel. All scans were processed with in-house developed software that segmented the lungs, excluded the airways, and computed the 15th percentile (PD15) emphysema measurement. The software also segmented the trachea and the region of air outside the body. Measurements were computed on the original data and on calibrated data. For calibration a Gaussian distribution was fitted to density values obtained from either air outside the body or from the trachea. HU values were shifted so that the peak of this Gaussian distribution coincided with -1000 HU. Results: On the original data, the mean(sd) of PD15 for the three cohorts was: -917(20), -942(21), -930(23) HU. Calibration using air outside the body was not effective: -908(20), -932(21), -921(23). Calibration using air in the trachea, however, almost completely removed the difference between the distributions of PD15: -938(18), -934(21), -932(22). Conclusion: The use of different scanners and reconstruction algorithms results in density variations in low attenuation areas within the body. A calibration procedure based on air measurements in the trachea can largely compensate for these effects. Clinical relevance/application: To obtain comparable emphysema measurements in multi-center studies, air density calibration based on measurements in air containing structures inside the body is essential.},

  abstract = {Convolutional networks have become state-of-the-art techniques for automatic medical image analysis, with the U-net architecture being the most popular at this moment. In this article we report the application of a 3D version of U-net to the automatic segmentation of prostate peripheral and transition zones in 3D MRI images. Our results are slightly better than recent studies that used 2D U-net and handcrafted feature approaches. In addition, we test ideas for improving the 3D U-net setup, by 1) letting the network segment surrounding tissues, making use of the fixed anatomy, and 2) adjusting the network architecture to reflect the anisotropy in the dimensions of the MRI image volumes. While the latter adjustment gave a marginal improvement, the former adjustment showed a significant deterioration of the network performance. We were able to explain this deterioration by inspecting feature map activations in all layers of the network. We show that to segment more tissues the network replaces feature maps that were dedicated to detecting prostate peripheral zones, by feature maps detecting the surrounding tissues.},

    Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Counting mitotic figures in histological images of breast cancer tissue has been shown to be a reliable and independent prognostic marker. Most successful methods for automatic counting involve training deep neural networks on H&E stained slides. This training requires extensive manual annotations of mitotic figures in H&E stained slides, which suffers from a low inter-observer agreement. Manual counting in PHH3 stained slides has a much higher inter-observer agreement.
    In this project we aimed to train GANs to map PHH3 slides to synthetic H&E slides and vice versa. A mitosis classifier is used to quantify the quality of the synthetic images, by comparing its performance after training on synthetic images with training on real images.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of childhood obesity is increasing rapidly. Visceral fat plays an important role in the pathogenesis of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Currently, computed tomography (CT) is broadly seen as the most accurate method of determining the amount of visceral fat. The main objective was to examine whether measures of abdominal visceral fat can be determined by ultrasound in children and whether CT can be replaced by ultrasound for this purpose. To assess whether preperitoneal fat thickness and area are good approximations of visceral fat at the umbilical level, we first retrospectively examined 47 CT scans of nonobese children (body mass index <30kg/m(2); median age 7.9 y [95\% range 1.2 to 16.2]). Correlation coefficients between visceral and preperitoneal fat thickness and area were 0.58 (p<0.001) and 0.76 (p<0.001), respectively. Then, to assess how preperitoneal and subcutaneous fat thicknesses and areas measured by ultrasound compare with these parameters in CT, we examined 34 nonobese children (median age 9.5 [95\% range 0.3 to 17.0]) by ultrasound and CT. Ultrasound measurements of preperitoneal and subcutaneous fat were correlated with CT measurements, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.75-0.97 (all p<0.001). Systematic differences of up to 24.0cm(2) for preperitoneal fat area (95\% confidence interval -29.9 to 77.9cm(2)) were observed when analyzing the results described by the Bland-Altman method. Our findings suggest that preperitoneal fat can be used as an approximation for visceral fat in children and that measuring abdominal fat with ultrasound in children is a valid method for epidemiological and clinical studies. However, the exact agreement between the ultrasound and CT scan was limited, which indicates that ultrasound should be used carefully for obtaining exact fat distribution measurements in individual children.},

  abstract = {Digital breast tomosynthesis is rapidly replacing digital mammography as the basic x-ray technique for evaluation of the breasts. However, the sparse sampling and limited angular range gives rise to dierent artifacts, which manufacturers try to solve in several ways. In this study we propose an extension of the Learned Primal-Dual algorithm for digital breast tomosynthesis. The Learned Primal-Dual algorithm is a deep neural network consisting of several `reconstruction blocks', which take in raw sinogram data as the initial input, perform a forward and a backward pass by taking projections and back-projections, and use a convolutional neural network to produce an intermediate reconstruction result which is then improved further by the successive reconstruction block. We extend the architecture by providing breast thickness measurements as a mask to the neural network and allow it to learn how to use this thickness mask. We have trained the algorithm on digital phantoms and the corresponding noise-free/noisy projections, and then tested the algorithm on digital phantoms for varying level of noise. Reconstruction performance of the algorithms was compared visually, using MSE loss and Structural Similarity Index. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline iterative reconstruction algorithm in terms of reconstruction quality for both breast edges and internal structures and is robust to noise.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {Purpose: The calculation of perfusion maps from dynamic CT sequences may depend on the software package used and the dose that was used during acquisition. The purpose of this work was to study this using a hybrid phantom consisting of intensity curves from patient data combined with realistic noise. Methods and Materials: We included CTP data from 10 patients with acute ischemic stroke (320 multi-detector row, 80 kV, 24 volumes, total scanning time of 202 s, cumulative dose of 2250 mAs). In each scan regions of interest were indicated in white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM). Tissue curves were averaged over these regions and used in a digital phantom. Noise patterns from an anthropomorphic head phantom scanned in the same scanner were added to the tissue curves to simulate an acquisition at 80, 70, 60 and 50% of the original dose. Also noise was added to the tissue curves to simulate 100% dose, these were used as a reference standard. The constructed phantom data set was analyzed with three perfusion software packages developed by Vital Images (VI), TeraRecon (TR) and Fraunhofer MEVIS (FM). With these packages the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were calculated. For each software package and each tissue type, ratios were calculated between the perfusion values at the simulated dose level and the reference standard. Wilcoxon ranked sum tests were used to determine if the ratios deviate from the reference. Results: CBF and CBV values of GM and WM increased significantly for dose reduction for al perfusion software packages (p<0.05).The CBF values in GM and WM increased significantly with dose reduction in al perfusion software packages (p<0.05). The mean patient CBF ratios calculated with the software packages ranged from 1.14 at 80% dose to 1.47 at 50% dose in GM. In WM, mean CBF values ranged from 1.14 up to 1.51 at 80 and 50% dose, respectively. The CBV values showed similar results. Here, mean ratios ranged from 1.18 to 1.49 in GM and 1.15 to 1.50 in WM, again at 80 and 50% dose. Conclusion: Cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume are strongly dependent on radiation dose in CT perfusion imaging. Dose reduction may lead to errors in perfusion values calculated with most software packages. Clinical relevance/application: Radiologists have to be aware of this effect and have to interpret absolute CT perfusion values with care if dose reduction is performed},

  abstract = {In this study, a pattern recognition-based framework is presented to automatically segment the complete cerebral vasculature from 4D Computed Tomography (CT) patient data. Ten consecutive patients whom were admitted to our hospital on a suspicion of ischemic stroke were included in this study. A background mask and bone mask were calculated based on intensity thresholding and morphological operations, and the following six image features were proposed: 1) a subtraction image of a subtraction image consisting of timing-invariant CTA and non-constrast CT, 2) the area under the curve of a gamma variate function fitted to the tissue curves, 3-5) three optimized parameter values of this gamma variate function, and 6) a vessel likeliness function. After masking bone and background, these features were used to train a linear discriminant voxel classifier (LDC) on regions of interest (ROIs), which were annotated in soft tissue (white matter and gray matter) and vessels by an expert observer. The LDC was trained in a leave-one-out manner in which 9 patients tissue ROIs were used for training and the remaining patient tissue ROIs were used for testing the classifier. To evaluate the frame work, for each training cycle the accuracy was calculated by dividing the true positives and negatives by the true positives and negatives and false positives and negatives. The resulting averaged accuracy was 0:985A,A+-0:014 with a range of 0:957 to 0:999.},

  abstract = {Blood vessels are a major cause of false positives in computer aided detection systems for the detection of breast cancer. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to construct a framework for the segmentation of blood vessels in screening mammograms. The proposed framework is based on supervised learning using a cascade classifier. This cascade classifier consists of several stages where in each stage a GentleBoost classifier is trained on Haar-like features. A total of 30 cases were included in this study. In each image, vessel pixels were annotated by selecting pixels on the centerline of the vessel, control samples were taken by annotating a region without any visible vascular structures. This resulted in a total of 31,000 pixels marked as vascular and over 4 million control pixels. After training, the classifier assigns a vesselness likelihood to the pixels. The proposed framework was compared to three other vessel enhancing methods, i) a vesselness filter, ii) a gaussian derivative filter, and iii) a tubeness filter. The methods were compared in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristics curves, the Az values. The Az value of the cascade approach is 0:85. This is superior to the vesselness, Gaussian, and tubeness methods, with Az values of 0:77, 0:81, and 0:78, respectively. From these results, it can be concluded that our proposed framework is a promising method for the detection of vessels in screening mammograms.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE:
                             In the past decades, computer-aided detection (CADe) systems have been developed to aid screening radiologists in the detection of malignant microcalcifications. These systems are useful to avoid perceptual oversights and can increase the radiologists' detection rate. However, due to the high number of false positives marked by these CADe systems, they are not yet suitable as an independent reader. Breast arterial calcifications (BACs) are one of the most frequent false positives marked by CADe systems. In this study, a method is proposed for the elimination of BACs as positive findings. Removal of these false positives will increase the performance of the CADe system in finding malignant microcalcifications.
                             METHODS:
                             A multistage method is proposed for the removal of BAC findings. The first stage consists of a microcalcification candidate selection, segmentation and grouping of the microcalcifications, and classification to remove obvious false positives. In the second stage, a case-based selection is applied where cases are selected which contain BACs. In the final stage, BACs are removed from the selected cases. The BACs removal stage consists of a GentleBoost classifier trained on microcalcification features describing their shape, topology, and texture. Additionally, novel features are introduced to discriminate BACs from other positive findings.
                             RESULTS:
                             The CADe system was evaluated with and without BACs removal. Here, both systems were applied on a validation set containing 1088 cases of which 95 cases contained malignant microcalcifications. After bootstrapping, free-response receiver operating characteristics and receiver operating characteristics analyses were carried out. Performance between the two systems was compared at 0.98 and 0.95 specificity. At a specificity of 0.98, the sensitivity increased from 37% to 52% and the sensitivity increased from 62% up to 76% at a specificity of 0.95. Partial areas under the curve in the specificity range of 0.8-1.0 were significantly different between the system without BACs removal and the system with BACs removal, 0.129 A+- 0.009 versus 0.144 A+- 0.008 (p<0.05), respectively. Additionally, the sensitivity at one false positive per 50 cases and one false positive per 25 cases increased as well, 37% versus 51% (p<0.05) and 58% versus 67% (p<0.05) sensitivity, respectively. Additionally, the CADe system with BACs removal reduces the number of false positives per case by 29% on average. The same sensitivity at one false positive per 50 cases in the CADe system without BACs removal can be achieved at one false positive per 80 cases in the CADe system with BACs removal.
                             CONCLUSIONS:
                             By using dedicated algorithms to detect and remove breast arterial calcifications, the performance of CADe systems can be improved, in particular, at false positive rates representative for operating points used in screening.},

Therefore, CNNs might be very suitable to detect microcalcifications in mammograms. In this study, we have configured a deep learning approach to fulfill this task. To overcome the large class imbalance between pixels belonging to microcalcifications and other breast tissue, we applied a hard negative mining strategy where two CNNs are used. The deep learning approach was compared to a current state-of-the-art method for the detection of microcalcifications: the cascade classifier. Both methods were trained on a large training set including 11,711 positive and 27 million negative samples. For testing, an independent test set was configured containing 5,298 positive and 18 million negative samples. The mammograms included in this study were acquired on mammography systems from three manufactures: Hologic, GE, and Siemens. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was carried out. Over the whole specificity range, the CNN approach yielded a higher sensitivity compared to the cascade classifier. Significantly higher mean sensitivities were obtained with the CNN on the mammograms of each individual manufacturer compared to the cascade classifier in the specificity range of 0 to 0.1. To our knowledge, this was the first study to use a deep learning strategy for the detection of microcalcifications in mammograms.},

This can cause radiologists to lose confidence in CADe, especially when many false positives are obviously not suspicious to them. In this study, we focus on obvious false positives generated by microcalcification detection algorithms. We aim at reducing the number of obvious false-positive findings by adding an additional step in the detection method. In this step, a multiclass machine learning method is implemented in which dedicated classifiers learn to recognize the patterns of obvious false-positive subtypes that occur most frequently. The method is compared to a conventional two-class approach, where all false-positive subtypes are grouped together in one class, and to the baseline CADe system without the new false-positive removal step. The methods are evaluated on an independent dataset containing 1,542 screening examinations of which 80 examinations contain malignant microcalcifications. Analysis showed that the multiclass approach yielded a significantly higher sensitivity compared to the other two methods (P < 0.0002). At one obvious false positive per 100 images, the baseline CADe system detected 61% of the malignant examinations, while the systems with the two-class and multiclass false-positive reduction step detected 73% and 83%, respectively. Our study showed that by adding the proposed method to a CADe system, the number of obvious false positives can decrease significantly (P < 0.0002).},

From a screening cohort of 63,895 women, exams were collected from 59,690 women without any abnormalities, 744 women with a screen-detected cancer and a prior negative exam, 781 women with a false positive exam based on calcifications, and 413 women with an interval cancer. A radiologist identified cancer-related calcifications, selected by a computer-aided detection system, on mammograms taken prior to screen-detected or interval cancer diagnoses. Using this ground truth and the pathology reports, the sensitivity for calcification detection and the proportion of lesions with visible calcifications that developed into invasive cancer were determined. The screening sensitivity for calcifications was 45.5%, at a specificity of 99.5%. A total of 68.4% (n = 177) of cancer-related calcifications that could have been detected earlier were associated with invasive cancer when diagnosed. Screening sensitivity for detection of malignant calcifications is low. Improving the detection of these early signs of cancer is important, because the majority of lesions with detectable calcifications that are not recalled immediately but detected as interval cancer or in the next screening round are invasive at the time of diagnosis.},

  abstract = {This thesis is dedicated to studying the theory of entropy and its relation to the Kolmogorov complexity. Originating in physics, the notion of entropy was introduced to mathematics by C. E. Shannon as a way of measuring the rate at which information is coming from a data source. There are, however, a few different ways of telling how much information there is: an alternative approach to quantifying the amount of information is the Kolmogorov complexity, which was proposed by A. N. Kolmogorov. The Shannon entropy is the key ingredient in the definition of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of a measure-preserving systems. Roughly speaking, the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy is the expected amount of information in `Shannon sense' that one obtains per unit of time by observing the evolution of a measure-preserving system. In topological dynamics, the topological entropy takes place of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. For metrizable systems, the topological entropy measures the exponential growth rate of the number of distinguishable partial orbits of length n as n tends to infinity. Originally defined for Z-actions, the 'classical' theories of entropy were later extended to actions of amenable groups.We provide a necessary background on amenable groups, topological/measurepreserving dynamics and the entropy theory in Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 5.The main focus of this thesis is extending the following results. First of all, a common generalization of the topological and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy theories for Z-systems was suggested by G. Palm. We provide an abstract generalization of the work of Palm for actions of discrete amenable groups in the language of measurement functors in Chapter 6.Secondly, we investigate the connection of entropy and Kolmogorov complexity.Originally, the equality between the topological entropy and a certain quantity measuring maximal asymptotic Kolmogorov complexity of the trajectories was established by A. A. Brudno for subshifts over Z. Later, he proved the equality of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and the asymptotic Kolmogorov complexity of almost every trajectory for ergodic subshifts over Z. We provide a generalization of these results as follows. Firstly, in Chapter 4 we give a background on computability and Kolmogorov complexity and, further, introduce computable Folner monotilings, which are central in our extensions of Brudno's results. We treat the 'first' and the 'second' theorems of Brudno in Chapter 7.The first theorem is generalized for subshifts over computable groups admitting computable Folner monotilings, while the second theorem is proved under the assertion of regularity of the monotiling, which we introduce in Chapter 7 as well.},

  abstract = {Unpaired image-to-image translation has attracted significant interest due to the invention of CycleGAN, a method which utilizes a combination of adversarial and cycle consistency losses to avoid the need for paired data. It is known that the CycleGAN problem might admit multiple solutions, and our goal in this paper is to analyze the space of exact solutions and to give perturbation bounds for approximate solutions. We show theoretically that the exact solution space is invariant with respect to automorphisms of the underlying probability spaces, and, furthermore, that the group of automorphisms acts freely and transitively on the space of exact solutions. We examine the case of zero pure CycleGAN loss first in its generality, and, subsequently, expand our analysis to approximate solutions for extended CycleGAN loss where identity loss term is included. In order to demonstrate that these results are applicable, we show that under mild conditions nontrivial smooth automorphisms exist. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence that neural networks can learn these automorphisms with unexpected and unwanted results. We conclude that finding optimal solutions to the CycleGAN loss does not necessarily lead to the envisioned result in image-to-image translation tasks and that underlying hidden symmetries can render the result useless.},

The algorithm also employs artifact rejection based on size, shape, and granularity to ensure only the nuclei of intermediate squamous epithelial cells are retained. An evaluation of the performance of the algorithm relative to expert manual segmentation of 33 fields-of-view from 11 Pap smear slides is also presented. The results show that the sensitivity and specificity of nucleus detection is 94.71% and 85.30% respectively, and that the accuracy of segmentation, measured using the Dice coefficient, of the detected nuclei is 97.30A,A+-1.3%.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel boosting algorithm to boost - i.e. improve on - existing methods for deformable image registration. The proposed DIRBoost algorithm is inspired by the theory on hypothesis boosting, well-known in the field of machine learning. DIRBoost involves a classifier for landmark-based Registration Error Detection (RED). Based on these RED predictions a Voronoi tessellation is generated to obtain a dense estimate of local image registration quality. All areas predicted as erroneous registration are subjected to boosting, i.e. undergo iterative registrations by employing boosting masks on both the fixed and moving image. We evaluated the DIRBoost algorithm on five CT pulmonary breathhold inspiration and expiration scan pairs, employing the NiftyReg registration algorithm. DIRBoost could boost about 50% of the wrongly registered areas which in turn also improved the average landmark registration error by 24%.},

  abstract = {Accurate registration of images is an important and often crucial step in many areas of image processing and analysis, yet it is only used in a small percentage of possible applications. Automated registration methods are not considered to be sufficiently robust to handle complex deformations and locally deviating intensities. The motive of this research has therefore been the development of methodology that learns to cope with such situations, from example registrations defined by experts. Image processing by learning has been successfully applied for image segmentation, but the concept is new to image registration. Thus, the research question of this thesis is in general:-How can machine learning be employed to improve deformable image registration?The developed methods were evaluated on registration of lung CT scans, in which two separate registration tasks were examined: change detection in follow-up scans and registration of inspiration and expiration images. The results of this research are presented in the following chapters. Chapter 2 presents an automatic method for quality assessment of medical image registration. It can be seen as a CAD system for detection and classification of registration errors. In Chapter 3, a boosting method (machine learning) is described that can improve state-of-the art image registration methods. Chapter 4 describes a meta-registration algorithm (machine learning) that automatically combines registrations obtained by different methods in order to arrive at an improved image registration result. Chapter 5 presents a knowledge model (machine learning) for local regularization of nonparametric registration methods. The thesis ends with a summary and general discussion in Chapter 6.},

  abstract = {Breast density, a breast cancer risk factor, is a radiologic feature that reflects fibroglandular tissue content relative to breast area or volume. Its histology is incompletely characterized. Here we use deep learning approaches to identify histologic correlates in radiologically-guided biopsies that may underlie breast density and distinguish cancer among women with elevated and low density. We evaluated hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained digitized images from image-guided breast biopsies (  = 852 patients). Breast density was assessed as global and localized fibroglandular volume (%). A convolutional neural network characterized H&E composition. In total 37 features were extracted from the network output, describing tissue quantities and morphological structure. A random forest regression model was trained to identify correlates most predictive of fibroglandular volume (  = 588). Correlations between predicted and radiologically quantified fibroglandular volume were assessed in 264 independent patients. A second random forest classifier was trained to predict diagnosis (invasive vs. benign); performance was assessed using area under receiver-operating characteristics curves (AUC). Using extracted features, regression models predicted global (  = 0.94) and localized (  = 0.93) fibroglandular volume, with fat and non-fatty stromal content representing the strongest correlates, followed by epithelial organization rather than quantity. For predicting cancer among high and low fibroglandular volume, the classifier achieved AUCs of 0.92 and 0.84, respectively, with epithelial organizational features ranking most important. These results suggest non-fatty stroma, fat tissue quantities and epithelial region organization predict fibroglandular volume. The model holds promise for identifying histological correlates of cancer risk in patients with high and low density and warrants further evaluation.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the inter-reader agreement for grading of retinal alterations in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using a reading center setting. Methods: In this cross-sectional case series, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT, Topcon 3D OCT, Tokyo, Japan) scans of 112 eyes of 112 patients with neovascular AMD (56 treatment-naive, 56 after three anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections) were analyzed by four independent readers. Imaging features specific for AMD were annotated using a novel custom-built annotation platform. Dice score, Bland-Altman plots, coefficients of repeatability (CR), coefficients of variation (CV), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were assessed. Results: Loss of ellipsoid zone, pigment epithelium detachment, subretinal fluid, and Drusen were the most abundant features in our cohort. The features subretinal fluid, intraretinal fluid, hypertransmission, descent of the outer plexiform layer, and pigment epithelium detachment showed highest inter-reader agreement, while detection and measures of loss of ellipsoid zone and retinal pigment epithelium were more variable. The agreement on the size and location of the respective annotation was more consistent throughout all features. Conclusions: The inter-reader agreement depended on the respective OCT-based feature. A selection of reliable features might provide suitable surrogate markers for disease progression and possible treatment effects focusing on different disease stages. This might give opportunities to a more time- and cost-effective patient assessment and improved decision-making as well as have implications for clinical trials and training machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {The immune infiltrate within tumors has proved to be very powerful in the prognostic stratification of patients and much attention is also being paid towards its predictive value. In this work we therefore aimed at clarifying the significance and impact of PD-L1 and PD-1 expression on the prognostic value of CD8  tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in a cohort of consecutive patients with primary resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tissue microarrays (TMA) were built using one representative formalin fixed paraffin embedded block for every case, with 5 cores for each block. TMA sections were stained with PD-L1 (clone SP263), PD-1 (clone NAT105) and CD8 (clone SP57). Number of CD8  cells per mm  were automatically counted; median, 25  and 75  percentiles of CD8  cells were used as threshold for statistical clinical outcome analysis and evaluated in patients subgroups defined by expression of PD-L1 and PD-1 within tumors. We found an overall strong prognostic value of CD8  cells in our cohort of 314 resected NSCLC, especially in PD-L1 negative tumors lacking PD-1  TILs, and demonstrated that in PD-L1 positive tumors a higher density of CD8  lymphocytes is necessary to improve the prognosis. Our data strengthen the concept of the importance of the assessment and quantification of the immune contexture in cancer and, similarly to what has been carried on in colorectal cancer, promote the efforts for the establishment of an Immunoscore for NSCLC for prognostic and possibly predictive purposes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment of hepatic steatosis is a key to grade disease severity in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). METHODS: We developed a digital automated quantification of steatosis on whole-slide images (WSIs) of liver tissue and performed a validation study. Hematoxylin-eosin stained liver tissue slides were digitally scanned, and steatotic areas were manually annotated. We identified thresholds for size and roundness parameters by logistic regression to discriminate steatosis from surrounding liver tissue. The resulting algorithm produces a steatosis proportionate area (SPA; ratio of steatotic area to total tissue area described as percentage). The software can be implemented as a Java plug-in in FIJI, in which digital WSI can be processed automatically using the Pathomation extension. RESULTS: We obtained liver tissue specimens from 61 NAFLD patients and 18 controls. The area under the curve of correctly classified steatosis by the algorithm was 0.970 (95% CI 0.968-0.973), P < 0.001. Accuracy of the algorithm was 91.9%, with a classification error of 8.1%. SPA correlated significantly with steatosis grade (Rs = 0.845, CI: 0.749-0.902, P < 0.001) and increased significantly with each individual steatosis grade, except between Grade 2 and 3. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a novel digital analysis algorithm that accurately quantifies steatosis on WSIs of liver tissue. This algorithm can be incorporated when quantification of steatosis is warranted, such as in clinical trials studying efficacy of new therapeutic interventions in NAFLD.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE To investigate density change between inspiration and expiration in thoracic CT at a lobar level and establish its relationship with pulmonary function. METHOD AND MATERIALS Sixty-seven male former or current heavy smokers underwent low-dose CT (16x0.75mm, 30 mAs, 120-140 kVp) at full inspiration, ultra low-dose CT (20 mAs, 90 kVp) at full expiration, and pulmonary function testing on the same day as part of a lung cancer screening trial. With in-house software, automatic non-rigid registration was performed to align the expiration scans precisely with their inspiration counterparts and the lobes were automatically segmented in the inspiration scans. Both scans were then blurred slightly to reduce the effect of noise and vessels were excluded by means of thresholding. The ratio of the Hounsfield values at expiration (H_exp) and at inspiration (H_insp) was calculated for each voxel in the registered lung volumes. The median, H, of the H_exp/H_insp ratios was calculated per lobe and for the entire lung volume and these medians were plotted against the FEV1/FVC ratios. Correlation coefficients, r, were measured to determine the presence of linear relationships between H and FEV1/FVC. Lines were fitted to the data and the line slopes, m, calculated in order to determine the predictive power of H in determining pulmonary function impairment. RESULTS The FEV1/FVC ratios varied from 0.48 to 0.92 with a mean value of 0.71. A stronger correlation between between H and FEV1/FVC was revealed in the lower lobes (r from -0.66 to -0.61) than in the upper and middle lobes (r from -0.47 to -0.38). Additionally the H ratios were more strongly predictive of FEV1/FVC for the lower lobes (m from -0.38 to -0.30) than for the upper and middle lobes (m from -0.23 to -0.16). For the entire lung volume the correlation and slope values were r=-0.58, m=-0.27. CONCLUSION Automatic regional density analysis on inspiration and expiration CT allows for the calculation of the ratio H which correlates well with measures of obstructive pulmonary impairment. The lower lobes appear to contribute more to functional impairment than the upper or middle lobes. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Quantitative analysis of regional density changes in the lung may allow for new insights into the mechanisms of COPD and the determinants of obstructive lung function in smokers.},

In this work a method is presented whereby detailed reference standard data may be constructed in an efficient semi-automatic fashion. A well-distributed set of n landmarks is detected fully automatically in one scan of a pair to be registered. Using a custom-designed interface, observers define corresponding anatomic locations in the second scan for a specified subset of s of these landmarks. The remaining n > s landmarks are matched fully automatically by a thin-plate-spline based system using the s manual landmark correspondences to model the relationship between the scans. The method is applied to 47 pairs of temporal thoracic CT scans, three pairs of brain MR scans and five thoracic CT datasets with synthetic deformations. Interobserver differences are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the matched points. The utility of the reference standard data as a tool in evaluating registration is shown by the comparison of six sets of registration results on the 47 pairs of thoracic CT data.},

  abstract = {EMPIRE10 (Evaluation of Methods for Pulmonary Image REgistration 2010) is a public platform for fair and meaningful comparison of registration algorithms which are applied to a database of intra-patient thoracic CT image pairs. Evaluation of non-rigid registration techniques is a non trivial task. This is compounded by the fact that researchers typically test only on their own data, which varies widely. For this reason, reliable assessment and comparison of different registration algorithms has been virtually impossible in the past. In this work we present the results of the launch phase of EMPIRE10, which comprised the comprehensive evaluation and comparison of 20 individual algorithms from leading academic and industrial research groups. All algorithms are applied to the same set of 30 thoracic CT pairs. Algorithm settings and parameters are chosen by researchers expert in the configuration of their own method and the evaluation is independent, using the same criteria for all participants. All results are published on the EMPIRE10 website (http://empire10.isi.uu.nl). The challenge remains ongoing and open to new participants. Full results from 24 algorithms have been published at the time of writing. This article details the organisation of the challenge, the data and evaluation methods and the outcome of the initial launch with 20 algorithms. The gain in knowledge and future work are discussed.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To analyze pulmonary function using a fully automatic technique which processes pairs of thoracic {CT} scans acquired at breath-hold inspiration and expiration, respectively. The following research objectives are identified to: (a) describe and systematically analyze the processing pipeline and its results; (b) verify that the quantitative, regional ventilation measurements acquired through CT are meaningful for pulmonary function analysis; (c) identify the most effective of the calculated measurements in predicting pulmonary function; and (d) demonstrate the potential of the system to deliver clinically important information not available through conventional spirometry. Methods: A pipeline of automatic segmentation and registration techniques is presented and demonstrated on a database of 216 subjects well distributed over the various stages of {COPD} (chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder). Lungs, fissures, airways, lobes, and vessels are automatically segmented in both scans and the expiration scan is registered with the inspiration scan using a fully automatic nonrigid registration algorithm. Segmentations and registrations are examined and scored by expert observers to analyze the accuracy of the automatic methods. Quantitative measures representing ventilation are computed at every image voxel and analyzed to provide information about pulmonary function, both globally and on a regional basis. These {CT} derived measurements are correlated with results from spirometry tests and used as features in a kNN classifier to assign {COPD} global initiative for obstructive lung disease ({GOLD}) stage. Results: The steps of anatomical segmentation (of lungs, lobes, and vessels) and registration in the workflow were shown to perform very well on an individual basis. All CT-derived measures were found to have good correlation with spirometry results, with several having correlation coefficients, r, in the range of 0.85-0.90. The best performing kNN classifier succeeded in classifying 67\% of subjects into the correct {COPD} {GOLD} stage, with a further 29\% assigned to a class neighboring the correct one. Conclusions: Pulmonary function information can be obtained from thoracic CT scans using the automatic pipeline described in this work. This preliminary demonstration of the system already highlights a number of points of clinical importance such as the fact that an inspiration scan alone is not optimal for predicting pulmonary function. It also permits measurement of ventilation on a per lobe basis which reveals, for example, that the condition of the lower lobes contributes most to the pulmonary function of the subject. It is expected that this type of regional analysis will be instrumental in advancing the understanding of multiple pulmonary diseases in the future.},

  abstract = {Background Chest radiography (CXR) may play an important role in triage for COVID-19, particularly in low-resource settings. Purpose To evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) system for detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiographs. Methods An AI system (CAD4COVID-Xray) was trained on 24,678 CXR images including 1,540 used only for validation while training. The test set consisted of a set of continuously acquired CXR images (n=454) obtained in patients suspected for COVID-19 pneumonia between March 4th and April 6th 2020 in a single center (223 RT-PCR positive subjects, 231 RT-PCR negative subjects). The radiographs were independently analyzed by six readers and by the AI system. Diagnostic performance was performed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results For the test set, the mean age of the patients was 67.3 (+/-14.4) years (56% male). Using RT-PCR test results as the reference standard, the AI system correctly classified CXR images as COVID-19 pneumonia with an AUC of 0.81. The system significantly outperforms each reader (p < 0.001 using McNemar test) at their highest possible sensitivities. At their lowest sensitivities, only one reader can significantly outperform the AI system (p=0.04). Conclusions An AI system for detection of COVID-19 on chest radiographs was comparable to six independent readers.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {PURPOSE To evaluate time to enhancement (TTE) as a parameter to differentiate benign from malignant lesions in MR Mammography using an ultrafast DCE protocol. METHOD AND MATERIALS 42 patients with 43 lesions (20 malignant, 23 benign, size range 3mm - 7 cm) were scanned at 3.0T (Siemens, Magneton Trio and Skyra) using a 16 channel bilateral breast coil. An interleaved protocol was used, in which a TWIST (Time-resolved angiography With Stochastic Trajectories) sequence was performed during and immediately after IV administration of 30 ml Gd-DOTA (20 time points, spatial resolution 1*0.9*2.5 mm, temporal resolution 4.32 seconds), preceded 1x and followed 5x by high resolution VIBE acquisitions (spatial resolution: 0.9*0.9*1 mm) lasting 107 seconds each. Consequently, the TWIST acquisitions could be used to assess TTE, whereas relative-enhancement versus time curves could be derived from the VIBE acquisitions. All evaluations were performed on a DynaCad workstation (InVivo), using primarily the maximum intensity projections (MIPs) of the subtracted series. TTE was defined as AC/a,!A"the timepoint were the lesion started to enhanceA-A?A 1/2 ? AC/a,!aEURoe AC/a,!A"the timepoint were the aorta started to enhanceA-A?A 1/2 ?. Lesions with TTE $AC/aEURdegA$?$ 12 seconds were considered malignant, Lesions with TTE $>$ 12 were considered benign. Similarly, based upon the curves we considered lesions with wash-out malignant and lesions with continuous enhancement benign. RESULTS Due to its speed the TWIST sequence showed less movement artifacts than the VIBE and -later- enhancing glandular tissue did not interfere with -earlier- enhancing lesions, making detection of the lesions on the MIPs easier. 19/23 malignancies had TTE $AC/aEURdegA$?$ 12 seconds, 17/20 benign lesions showed TTE $>$ 12 seconds. Using the curves, 19/ 23 malignancies showed wash-out and 13/20 benign lesions had continuous enhancement. Corresponding accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for TTE were 84, 83, 85, 86 and 81, compared to 74, 83, 65, 74 and 75 for curve analysis. CONCLUSION TTE is a strong discriminator between benign and malignant breast disease and appears to improve especially the specificity of the exam when compared to curve analysis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Ultrafast MRI, allowing evaluation of both inflow of contrast and morphology can be used to substantially shorten current MRI protocols. This may allow MRI screening at substantially lower costs.},

CXRs were electronically scored as normal (CAD score AC/aEURdegA$?60) or abnormal (CAD score>60) using a CAD program. All patients regardless of CAD score were requested to submit a spot sputum sample for testing with Xpert and a spot and morning sample for testing with LED Fluorescence Microscopy-(FM).Of 350 patients with evaluable data, 291 (83.1\%) had an abnormal CXR score by CAD. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of CXR compared to Xpert were 100\% (95\%CI 96.2-100), 23.2\% (95\%CI 18.2-28.9), 33.0\% (95\%CI 27.6-38.7) and 100\% (95\% 93.9-100), respectively. The area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) for CAD was 0.71 (95\%CI 0.66-0.77). CXR abnormality correlated with smear grade (rAC/a,!A =AC/a,!A 0.30, p<0.0001) and with Xpert CT(rAC/a,!A =AC/a,!A 0.37, p<0.0001).To our knowledge this is the first time that a CAD program for TB has been successfully tested in a real world setting. The study shows that the CAD program had high sensitivity but low specificity and PPV. The use of CAD with digital CXR has the potential to increase the use and availability of chest radiography in screening for TB where trained human resources are scarce.},

  abstract = {Purpose:To determine if prostatitis and prostate cancer (PCa) can be distinguished by using apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) on magnetic resonance (MR) images, with specimens obtained at MR-guided biopsy as the standard of reference.Materials and Methods:The need for institutional review board approval and informed consent was waived. MR-guided biopsies were performed in 130 consecutive patients with cancer-suspicious regions (CSRs) on multiparametric MR images obtained at 3 T. In this retrospective study, 88 patients met the inclusion criteria. During the biopsy procedure, an axial diffusion-weighted sequence was performed and ADC maps were generated (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 2000/67; section thickness, 4 mm; in-plane resolution, 1.8 AfaEUR" 1.8 mm; and b values of 0, 100, 500, and 800 sec/mm(2)). Subsequently, a confirmation image with the needle left in situ was acquired and projected on the ADC map. The corresponding ADCs at the biopsy location were compared with the histopathologic outcomes of the biopsy specimens. Linear mixed-model regression analyses were used to test for ADC differences between the histopathologic groups.Results:The study included 116 biopsy specimens. Median ADCs of normal prostate tissue, prostatitis, low-grade PCa (Gleason grade components 2 or 3), and high-grade PCa (Gleason grade components 4 or 5) were 1.22 AfaEUR" 10(-3) mm(2)/sec (standard deviation, A,A+- 0.21), 1.08 AfaEUR" 10(-3) mm(2)/sec (A,A+- 0.18), 0.88 AfaEUR" 10(-3) mm(2)/sec (A,A+- 0.15), and 0.88 AfaEUR" 10(-3) mm(2)/sec (A,A+- 0.13), respectively. Although the median ADCs of biopsy specimens with prostatitis were significantly higher compared with low- and high-grade PCa (P < .001), there is a considerable overlap between the tissue types.Conclusion:Diffusion-weighted imaging is a noninvasive technique that shows differences between prostatitis and PCa in both the peripheral zone and central gland, although its usability in clinical practice is limited as a result of significant overlap in ADCs.A,A(c) RSNA, 2013.},

  abstract = {This report is to complement the original Fleischner Society recommendations for incidentally detected solid nodules by proposing a set of recommendations specifically aimed at subsolid nodules. The development of a standardized approach to the interpretation and management of subsolid nodules remains critically important given that peripheral adenocarcinomas represent the most common type of lung cancer, with evidence of increasing frequency. Following an initial consideration of appropriate terminology to describe subsolid nodules and a brief review of the new classification system for peripheral lung adenocarcinomas sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), American Thoracic Society (ATS), and European Respiratory Society (ERS), six specific recommendations were made, three with regard to solitary subsolid nodules and three with regard to multiple subsolid nodules. Each recommendation is followed first by the rationales underlying the recommendation and then by specific pertinent remarks. Finally, issues for which future research is needed are discussed. The recommendations are the result of careful review of the literature now available regarding subsolid nodules. Given the complexity of these lesions, the current recommendations are more varied than the original Fleischner Society guidelines for solid nodules. It cannot be overemphasized that these guidelines must be interpreted in light of an individual's clinical history. Given the frequency with which subsolid nodules are encountered in daily clinical practice, and notwithstanding continuing controversy on many of these issues, it is anticipated that further refinements and modifications to these recommendations will be forthcoming as information continues to emerge from ongoing research.},

  booktitle = ESTI,
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {Aim: To determine whether a) increasing numbers of readers and b) methods of arbitration significantly influence nodule detection. Methods: 85 CTs performed as part of the NELSON lung cancer screening trial were read by five experienced thoracic radiologists twice. During the first reading, radiologists classified all opacities as positive (nodules>3mm) or negative (non-nodular opacities and nodules <3mm). In the second reading, each radiologist categorised the opacities identified by the other radiologists. Readers' final scores were combined to simulate double- and triple-reading. For double-reading, if there was disagreement a third independent reader provided arbitration. For triple-reading, >=2 radiologists in agreement constituted a positive reading. The reference standard was agreement by >=4 radiologists. Results: 531 opacities were identified, of which 186 (35.0%) nodules met reference standard criteria. Double-reading without arbitration had a variable impact on nodule detection: there was a significant increase in mean sensitivity (22.6%, p<0.005) and specificity (11.3%, p<0.05) in 5 and 16 pairs respectively, a significant reduction in mean sensitivity (20.7%, p<0.005) in 2 pairs, and no change in mean sensitivity and specificity in 13 and 4 pairs respectively. Triple-reading or double-reading with arbitration significantly increased mean sensitivity in 29/30 triple-reader combinations (24.5%, p<0.05) and 6/10 pairs (17.7%, p<0.05) respectively, but there was a significantly decreased mean specificity in 26/30 triple-reader combinations (11.3%, p<0.05) and 10/10 pairs respectively (11.7%, p<0.0005). Conclusions: Double-reading does not invariably improve nodule detection accuracy for experienced thoracic radiologists. However improved sensitivity is achieved by triple-reading or double-reading with independent arbitration, at the expense of reduced specificity.},

  abstract = {High mammographic density is a well-known risk factor for breast cancer. This study aimed to search for a possible birth cohort effect on mammographic density, which might contribute to explain the increasing breast cancer incidence. We separately analysed left and right breast density of Dutch women from a 13-year period (2003-2016) in the breast cancer screening programme. First, we analysed age-specific changes in average percent dense volume (PDV) across birth cohorts. A linear regression analysis (PDV vs. year of birth) indicated a small but statistically significant increase in women of: 1) age 50 and born from 1952 to 1966 (left, slope = 0.04, p =0.003; right, slope = 0.09, p<0.0001); 2) age 55 and born from 1948 to 1961 (right, slope = 0.04, p=0.01); and 3) age 70 and born from 1933 to 1946 (right, slope = 0.05, p=0.002). A decrease of total breast volume seemed to explain the increase in PDV. Second, we compared proportion of women with dense breast in women born in 1946-1953 and 1959-1966, and observed a statistical significant increase of proportion of highly dense breast in later born women, in the 51 to 55 age-groups for the left breast (around a 20% increase in each age-group), and in the 50 to 56 age-groups for the right breast (increase ranging from 27% to 48%). The study indicated a slight increase in mammography density across birth cohorts, most pronounced for women in their early 50s, and more marked for the right than for the left breast.

  abstract = {Objective: We investigated whether breast cancer is predicted by a breast cancer risk mammographic texture resemblance (MTR) marker. Methods: A previously published case-control study included 495 women of which 245 were diagnosed with breast cancer. In baseline mammograms, 2-4 years prior to diagnosis, the following mammographic parameters were analysed for relation to breast cancer risk: (C) categorical parenchymal pattern scores; (R) radiologist's percentage density, (P) computer-based percentage density; (H) computer-based breast cancer risk MTR marker; (E) computer-based hormone replacement treatment MTR marker; and (A) an aggregate of P and H. Results: Density scores, C, R, and P correlated (tau=0.3-0.6); no other pair of scores showed large (tau>0.2) correlation. For the parameters, the odds ratios of future incidence of breast cancer comparing highest to lowest categories (146 and 106 subject respectively) were C: 2.4(1.4-4.2), R: 2.4(1.4-4.1), P: 2.5(1.5-4.2), E: non-significant, H: 4.2(2.4-7.2), and A: 5.6(3.2-9.8). The AUC analysis showed a similarly increasing pattern (C: 0.58?0.02, R: 0.57?0.03, P: 0.60?0.03, H: 0.63?0.02, A: 0.66?0.02). The AUC of the aggregate marker (A) surpasses others significantly except H. HRT-MTR (E) did not significantly identify future cancers or correlate with any other marker. Conclusions: Breast cancer risk MTR marker was independent of density scores and more predictive of risk. The hormone replacement treatment MTR marker did not identify patients at risk.},

  abstract = {{D}iabetic retinopathy is a common ocular complication of diabetes. {I}t is the most frequent cause of blindness in the working population of the {U}nited {S}tates and the {E}uropean {U}nion. {E}arly diagnosis, and treatment can prevent vision loss in the majority of cases. {Y}et only approximately 50% of people with diabetes are regularly screened for the presence of signs of diabetic retinopathy. {C}omputer aided diagnosis technology and digital retinal imaging could help to facilitate a large scale screening of people with diabetes. {T}he research in this thesis is focused on the development of an automatic diabetic retinopathy detection system. {T}his system would select exams which possibly contain signs of the presence of diabetic retinopathy and present only those to an ophthalmologist. {I}n this manner the total workload of the ophthalmologist could be reduced. {A} number of different automatic screening system components are described and evaluated: {A}n automatic system for the quantification of retinal image quality. {I}mage quality is an important issue in large scale screening programs where images are acquired at many different sites, using different cameras and operators. {I}t forms an essential component of an automatic screening system. {S}everal different techniques for the automatic detection of the vasculature in retinal images are compared. {A} new technique is proposed and shown to exhibit good performance in comparison with the techniques from the literature. {I}n addition to the vasculature, other anatomical landmarks are present on the retina, in particular the optic disc, the macula and the vascular arch. {T}he location of these anatomical landmarks can be used to determine a relative position on the retina, and this spatial information about potential lesions can be used to remove false positive lesion detections and provide important diagnostic information. {A} system which is able to automatically find a set of points in a retinal image and thereby identify the location of the most important retinal anatomy is described. {R}ed lesions are amongst the first signs of the presence of diabetic retinopathy and are therefore important to detect. {A}n automatic red lesion detection system, based on a pixel classification approach, is described. {W}hen diabetic retinopathy progresses also bright lesions appear. {A}n automatic detection system for these lesions is also presented. {T}he individual system components are combined into a comprehensive screening system. {T}his system is evaluated on a large dataset containing 40,000 images obtained in 10,000 eye examinations. {A} novel method is proposed to combine the outputs of the various system components into a single opinion about the complete examination. {T}he results shown that the system is able to detect the majority of suspect exams at a specificity above 50%.},

  abstract = {Parameters extracted from the vasculature on the retina are correlated with various conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and cardiovascular diseases such as stroke. Segmentation of the vasculature on the retina has been a topic that has received much attention in the literature over the past decade. Analysis of the segmentation result, however, has only received limited attention with most works describing methods to accurately measure the width of the vessels. Analyzing the connectedness of the vascular network is an important step towards the characterization of the complete vascular tree. The retinal vascular tree, from an image interpretation point of view, originates at the optic disc and spreads out over the retina. The tree bifurcates and the vessels also cross each other. The points where this happens form the key to determining the connectedness of the complete tree. We present a supervised method to detect the bifurcations and crossing points of the vasculature of the retina. The method uses features extracted from the vasculature as well as the image in a location regression approach to find those locations of the segmented vascular tree where the bifurcation or crossing occurs (from here, POI, points of interest). We evaluate the method on the publicly available DRIVE database in which an ophthalmologist has marked the POI.},

  abstract = {A decreased ratio of the width of retinal arteries to veins (Arteriolar-to-Venular diameter Ratio, AVR), is well established as predictive of cerebral atrophy, stroke and other cardiovascular events in adults. Tortuous and dilated arteries and veins, as well as decreased AVR are also markers for Plus disease in retinopathy of prematurity. This work presents an automated method to estimate the AVR in retinal color images by detecting the location of the optic disc, determining an appropriate region of interest (ROI), classifying vessels as arteries or veins, estimating vessel widths, and calculating the AVR. After vessel segmentation and vessel width determination, the optic disc is located and the system eliminates all vessels outside the AVR measurement ROI. A skeletonization operation is applied to the remaining vessels after which vessel crossings and bifurcation points are removed, leaving a set of vessel segments consisting of only vessel centerline pixels. Features are extracted from each centerline pixel in order to assign these a soft label indicating the likelihood that the pixel is part of a vein. As all centerline pixels in a connected vessel segment should be the same type, the median soft label is assigned to each centerline pixel in the segment. Next, artery vein pairs are matched using an iterative algorithm, and the widths of the vessels are used to calculate the AVR. We trained and tested the algorithm on a set of 65 high resolution digital color fundus photographs using a reference standard that indicates for each major vessel in the image whether it is an artery or vein. We compared the AVR values produced by our system with those determined by a semi-automated reference system. We obtained a mean unsigned error of 0.06 (SD 0.04) in 40 images with a mean AVR of 0.67. A second observer using the semi-automated system obtained the same mean unsigned error of 0.06 (SD 0.05) on the set of images with a mean AVR of 0.66. The testing data and reference standard used in this study has been made publicly available.},

  abstract = {{A}utomatic segmentation of the endocardial surface in three-dimensional (3{D}) echocardiographic images is an important tool to assess left ventricular ({LV}) geometry and cardiac output ({CO}). {T}he presence of speckle noise as well as the nonisotropic characteristics of the myocardium impose strong demands on the segmentation algorithm. {I}n the analysis of normal heart geometries of standardized (apical) views, it is advantageous to incorporate a priori knowledge about the shape and appearance of the heart. {I}n contrast, when analyzing abnormal heart geometries, for example in children with congenital malformations, this a priori knowledge about the shape and anatomy of the {LV} might induce erroneous segmentation results. {T}his study describes a fully automated segmentation method for the analysis of non-standard echocardiographic images, without making strong assumptions on the shape and appearance of the heart. {T}he method was validated in vivo in a piglet model. {R}eal-time 3{D} echocardiographic image sequences of five piglets were acquired in radiofrequency (rf) format. {T}hese {ECG}-gated full volume images were acquired intra-operatively in a non-standard view. {C}ardiac blood flow was measured simultaneously by an ultrasound transit time flow probe positioned around the common pulmonary artery. {T}hree-dimensional adaptive filtering using the characteristics of speckle was performed on the demodulated rf data to reduce the influence of speckle noise and to optimize the distinction between blood and myocardium. {A} gradient-based 3{D} deformable simplex mesh was then used to segment the endocardial surface. {A} gradient and a speed force were included as external forces of the model. {T}o balance data fitting and mesh regularity, one fixed set of weighting parameters of internal, gradient and speed forces was used for all data sets. {E}nd-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were computed from the segmented endocardial surface. {T}he cardiac output derived from this automatic segmentation was validated quantitatively by comparing it with the {CO} values measured from the volume flow in the pulmonary artery. {R}elative bias varied between 0 and -17\%, where the nominal accuracy of the flow meter is in the order of 10\%. {A}ssuming the {CO} measurements from the flow probe as a gold standard, excellent correlation (r = 0.99) was observed with the {CO} estimates obtained from image segmentation.},

  abstract = {Clinical diagnosis of heart disease might be substantially supported by automated segmentation of the endocardial surface in three-dimensional (3-D) echographic images. Because of the poor echogenicity contrast between blood and myocardial tissue in some regions and the inherent speckle noise, automated analysis of these images is challenging. A priori knowledge on the shape of the heart cannot always be relied on, e.g., in children with congenital heart disease, segmentation should be based on the echo features solely. The objective of this study was to investigate the merit of using temporal cross-correlation of radio-frequency (RF) data for automated segmentation of 3-D echocardiographic images. Maximum temporal cross-correlation (MCC) values were determined locally from the RF-data using an iterative 3-D technique. MCC values as well as a combination of MCC values and adaptive filtered, demodulated RF-data were used as an additional, external force in a deformable model approach to segment the endocardial surface and were tested against manually segmented surfaces. Results on 3-D full volume images (Philips, iE33) of 10 healthy children demonstrate that MCC values derived from the RF signal yield a useful parameter to distinguish between blood and myocardium in regions with low echogenicity contrast and incorporation of MCC improves the segmentation results significantly. Further investigation of the MCC over the whole cardiac cycle is required to exploit the full benefit of it for automated segmentation.},

  title = {Knowledge distillation with ensembles of convolutional neural networks for medical image segmentation},
  doi = {https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JMI.9.5.052407},
  abstract = {Purpose: Ensembles of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often outperform a single CNN in medical image segmentation tasks, but inference is computationally more expensive and makes ensembles unattractive for some applications. We compared the performance of differently constructed ensembles with the performance of CNNs derived from these ensembles using knowledge distillation, a technique for reducing the footprint of large models such as ensembles.

  Approach: We investigated two different types of ensembles, namely, diverse ensembles of networks with three different architectures and two different loss-functions, and uniform ensembles of networks with the same architecture but initialized with different random seeds. For each ensemble, additionally, a single student network was trained to mimic the class probabilities predicted by the teacher model, the ensemble. We evaluated the performance of each network, the ensembles, and the corresponding distilled networks across three different publicly available datasets. These included chest computed tomography scans with four annotated organs of interest, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with six annotated brain structures, and cardiac cine-MRI with three annotated heart structures.

  Results: Both uniform and diverse ensembles obtained better results than any of the individual networks in the ensemble. Furthermore, applying knowledge distillation resulted in a single network that was smaller and faster without compromising performance compared with the ensemble it learned from. The distilled networks significantly outperformed the same network trained with reference segmentation instead of knowledge distillation.

  Conclusion: Knowledge distillation can compress segmentation ensembles of uniform or diverse composition into a single CNN while maintaining the performance of the ensemble.},

  title = {Variability of relative cerebral blood volume normalization in patients with gliomas: Interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility study},
  booktitle = ISMRM,
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {Purpose: Due to limited spatial resolution in T2* dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MR imaging (DSC-MRI) arterial measurements are difficult. Therefore absolute quantification of Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) is difficult and relative CBV (rCBV) values are reported. In order to reduce intraindividual differences in CBV values determined by DSC-MRI, CBV is normalized to normal appearing white matter (NAWM) or normal appearing gray matter (NAGM). We determined the variability of such rCBV values depending on the choice of the region of interest (ROI) in NAWM or NAGM. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 17 patients with pathologically proven gliomas for whom DSC-MRI was available. DSC-MRI used a T2* weighted sequence with 5mm thickness and 2s temporal resolution. Measurements were performed by two observers. First, observer 1 generated rCBV maps on which a tumor ROI was defined that contained the region with highest tumor perfusion. This ROI was kept constant for the subsequent normalization step using NAWM or NAGM. ROIs were drawn on 1) contralateral NAWM by choice, 2) the same axial section as tumor ROI in the contralateral NAWM, 3) contralateral NAGM by choice, 4) NAWM near corpus callosum, 5) contralateral putamen, 6) contralateral thalamus and 7) a large ROI in contralateral centrum semiovale by both observers. These ROIs were used as internal reference standard to calculate rCBV. After a first evaluation (T1), a second evaluation (T2) was performed using the same method as described above after 2 months. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine significant difference between rCBVtumor measurements of T1 and T2 (intraobserver) and between both observers (interobserver) (significance level p < .05). Inter- and intraobserver reproducibility were also both quantified with intraclass correlation coefficient (R) and the coefficient of variation (CV). Results: Wilcoxon signed-rank test did not show significant difference between rCBVtumor measurements of the first evaluation and second evaluation for all ROIs and for both observers (p > .05). Intraobserver CV ranged between 7% - 19% for observer 1 and 12% - 23% for observer 2. Intraclass correlation coefficient (R) showed excellent intraobserver reproducibility for contralateral putamen, thalamus and centrum semiovale for observer 1 (R > .74) and good intraobserver reproducibility for contralateral putamen (R = .69) and centrum semiovale (R = 0.74) for observer 2. Wilcoxon signed-rank test did not show significant difference between rCBVtumor measurements of observer 1 and 2 for contralateral NAWM by choice, corpus callosum and putamen. Interobserver CV ranged from 12% to 17% (except for NAWM where CV was 42%). Intraclass correlation coefficient (R) showed excellent interobserver reproducibility for contralateral putamen (R = .76) and centrum semiovale (R = .77) . Conclusion: Our findings show good intra- and interobserver CV of rCBV measurements. Contralateral putamen chosen as internal reference standard for rCBV shows least interobserver variability and a low intraobserver variability.},

  booktitle = ECR,
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {Purpose: Optimizing data acquisition strategies for cerebral CT perfusion (CTP) studies is difficult in clinical practice. We developed a hybrid digital phantom to study the influence of various acquisition parameters on CTP maps. Material and Methods: The phantom uses scans of an epoxy-filled human skull to provide a homogeneous background with realistic noise patterns derived from a 320-row CT scanner. Superimposed geometric shapes with real patient perfusion curves are digitally added. By manipulating the time tags of the images and by using noise patterns derived with various exposure settings different CTP acquisition strategies can be simulated. The resulting perfusion maps allow for studying contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of the superimposed shapes. We tested the phantom by simulating a clinical CTP protocol. We measured arterial input functions (AIF) and tissue curves in grey and white matter (GM, WM) in 9 patients. GM-to-WM CNR derived from the CBF maps were calculated for patients and compared to values of the phantom using identical AIF and tissue curves that were superimposed on the background (simulating WM) and on a circular object (20mm, simulating GM). Results: Measured noise in CBF maps from patient and phantom data was within 13% (1.9-23.9%) of each other. CNR for CBF maps derived from the phantom (20mm object) and patient data correlated well (R = 0.93). Conclusion: The phantom provides a good estimate of real noise in CTP maps and allows for measuring CNR. It can play a major role for future optimization of CTP protocols.},

  title = {Influence of Temporal Sampling Rate of CTP acquisitions on Cerebral Perfusion Maps using a Digital Phantom},
  abstract = {Purpose: To study the influence of the temporal sampling rate in cerebral CT perfusion scans using noise-free synthetic data sets created with a digital phantom. Materials and Methods: Noise-free synthetic data sets were created with a digital phantom which consists of a skull derived from a human skull phantom combined with arterial input and venous output functions, white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) time-attenuation curves (TAC) obtained from 5 patients. By manipulating the time tags CTP protocols with a total scan duration of 60s and a temporal sampling rate of 1, 2, 3 and 4s were simulated. The 1s protocol was used as reference standard. The 2, 3 and 4s protocols were shifted with 1s to measure the influence of missing peak points of the curve, resulting in 1, 2, 3 extra data sets, respectively. CBF, CBV and MTT maps were calculated using PMA (ASIST-Japan). Mean values of GM and WM of the protocols were compared to the reference protocol. Results: By increasing temporal resolution, CBF values decreased, MTT values increased and CBV stayed relatively the same for WM and GM: CBF values were within 63%, 75% and 85% of the reference standard for 2s, 3s and 4s protocols, respectively. MTT values were within 69%, 156% and 238% of the reference standard for 2s, 3s and 4s protocols, respectively. CBV values stayed within 50% of the reference standard for all protocols. Conclusion: Cerebral perfusion values are strongly influenced by temporal sampling rate.},

  booktitle = ECR,
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {Purpose: One-step stroke imaging is a CT perfusion(CTP) scan in which one volumetric acquisition is replaced to acquire a carotid CTA using toggling table technique and a single dose of contrast agent. The purpose of this study is to determine if missing one acquisition of the CTP influences the CTP values. Methods and Materials: Ten patients with suspicion of ischemic stroke were scanned with a clinical CTP head protocol(14 scans every 2s, 5 scans every 5s) with a total duration of 55s using a 320-row CT scanner. The one-step stroke protocol is simulated from the original clinical protocol by deleting one acquisition. For every patient, the timepoint of the bolus arrival time(BAT) and the arterial peak(AP) in the middle cerebral artery was determined. One acquisition was deleted starting from the BAT up to the fifth time point after AP. Corresponding perfusion maps were calculated with bSVD using PMA-ASIST. Regions of interests(ROIs) were annotated in normal-appearing grey and white matter. The percentage errors were calculated per timepoint and patient. Results: The absolute mean of the percentage errors across all patients for each timepoint in grey matter compared to the original CBF, CBV and MTT is 3.40%(range 0.10-9.53%), 3.22%(0.00-9.98%) and 3.08%(0.00-13.79%), respectively. Percentage errors>8.50% occurred for some patients if an acquisition was deleted at BAT, 2s-4s after BAT, AP or after the AP. Similar results were found in WM. Conclusion: A one-step stroke protocol is feasible with only minor effects on the CTP maps if CTA is acquired 2-4s after BAT and before the AP.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: One-Step-Stroke imaging is a CTP acquisition in which one volumetric scan is substituted by volumetric neck CTA, using a toggling table technique and a single dose of contrast agent (see figure). It is not clear how missing one time point of the CTP acquisition to obtain the neck CTA will affect the perfusion maps and which time point is best suited for neck CTA. We determined the optimum timing of neck CTA with the least effect on cerebral perfusion maps. METHOD AND MATERIALS: 20 consecutive patients with suspicion of ischemic stroke were scanned with a clinical CTP head protocol using a 320-row CT scanner. A neck CTA takes maximal 4s, therefore omitting one time point of the CTP with 2s scan interval is sufficient. The One-Step-Stroke protocol was simulated from the original protocol by eliminating one acquisition at various time points. The elimination of one acquisition of CTP simulates the acquisition of the neck CTA. For every patient one volumetric acquisition was deleted, starting from the bolus arrival time up to the fifth time point after the arterial peak determined from the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Corresponding perfusion maps were calculated. Percentage errors were calculated for all perfusion parameters (CBF, CBV, MTT) in basal ganglia and white matter per time point and per patient. Bolus tracking is simulated by using the enhancement curves in the MCA to derive relative thresholds (40-100HU). The relative thresholds were used to determine the time point resulting in the smallest error across all patients. RESULTS: A volumetric CTP scan deleted 2s after reaching a threshold of 40AC/a,!aEURoe70HU kept the absolute percentage errors of all perfusion parameters below 10% in all patients. A relative threshold of 70HU for bolus tracking of the CTA gave the lowest absolute percentage errors for CTP parameters (mean <3.0%, maximum always <7.5%) for acquiring the neck CTA. Estimated average enhancement at CTA, measured in the MCA, was 302HU (range 198AC/a,!aEURoe408HU). CONCLUSION: Our simulations suggest that the One-Step-Stroke protocol does not significantly alter absolute perfusion values and creates high enhancement in the carotids, if the neck CTA is acquired 2s after a threshold of 70HU in the MCA. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: One-step stroke imaging is a single exam sequence where the neck CTA is part of the CTP. One-Step-Stroke imaging has the potential to replace CTA and CTP which saves radiation dose and contrast agent dose.},

Twenty patients with suspicion of acute ischaemic stroke were prospectively scanned and evaluated with a head and neck CTA and with the One-Step Stroke Protocol. Arterial enhancement and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the carotid arteries was assessed. Three observers scored artefacts and image quality of the cervical arteries. The total z-coverage was evaluated. Mean enhancement in the carotid bifurcation was rated higher in the vCTA (595 +- 164 HU) than CTA (441 +- 117 HU). CNR was rated higher in vCTA. Image quality scores showed no significant difference in the region of the carotid bifurcation between vCTA and CTA. Lower neck image quality scores were slightly lower for vCTA due to artefacts, although not rated as diagnostically relevant. In ten patients, the origin of the left common carotid artery was missed by 1.6 +- 0.8 cm. Mean patient height was 1.8 +- 0.09 m.

One observer annotated the tumour hotspot that was kept constant for all measurements. All observers annotated eight reference tissues of normal white and grey matter. Observer variability was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV) and Bland-Altman analyses.

                             Results: For intra-observer, the ICC ranged from 0.50-0.97 (fair-excellent) for all reference tissues. The CV ranged from 5.1-22.1 % for all reference tissues and observers. For inter-observer, the ICC for all pairwise observer combinations ranged from 0.44-0.92 (poor-excellent). The CV ranged from 8.1-31.1 %. Centrum semiovale was the only reference tissue that showed excellent intra- and inter-observer agreement (ICC>0.85) and lowest CVs (<12.5 %). Bland-Altman analyses showed that mean differences for centrum semiovale were close to zero.

  abstract = {Purpose:
                             EPID dosimetry in the Unity MR-Linac system allows for reconstruction of absolute dose distributions within the patient geometry. Dose reconstruction is accurate for the parts of the beam arriving at the EPID through the MRI central unattenuated region, free of gradient coils, resulting in a maximum field size of ~10x22 cm2 at isocentre. The purpose of this study is to develop a Deep Learning-based method to improve the accuracy of 2D EPID reconstructed dose distributions outside this central region, accounting for the effects of the extra attenuation and scatter.

                             Methods:
                             A U-Net was trained to correct EPID dose images calculated at the isocenter inside a cylindrical phantom using the corresponding TPS dose images as ground truth for training. The model was evaluated using a 5-fold cross validation procedure. The clinical validity of the U-Net corrected dose images (the so-called DEEPID dose images) was assessed with in vivo verification data of 45 large rectum IMRT fields. The sensitivity of DEEPID to leaf bank position errors (+-1.5 mm) and +-5% MU delivery errors was also tested.

                             Results:
                             Compared to the TPS, in vivo 2D DEEPID dose images showed an average g-pass rate of 90.2% (72.6%-99.4%) outside the central unattenuated region. Without DEEPID correction, this number was 44.5% (4.0%-78.4%). DEEPID correctly detected the introduced delivery errors .
                             Conclusions: DEEPID allows for accurate dose reconstruction using the entire EPID image, thus enabling dosimetric verification for field sizes up to ~19x22 cm2 at isocentre. The method can be used to detect clinically relevant errors.},

  abstract = {We prospectively compared in a blinded fashion spiral computed tomography angiography (CTA) with arteriography in 62 consecutive patients with suspected renal artery stenosis (RAS). For CTA 150 ml of contrast material were injected intravenously. Arteriography was performed by DSA technique with selective catheterization of renal arteries. Of the 157 visualized renal arteries 155 could be evaluated with DSA and a total of 157 with CTA. Sensitivity of CTA for RAS > or = 50\% was 98\% and the specificity was 94\%. Comparison of the grade of stenosis as evaluated by DSA versus CTA showed: identical gradation in 59 arteries (DSA > or = 50\%/CTA > or = 50\%), underestimation by CTA in one artery (DSA 50 to 75\%/CTA < 50\%), and overestimation by CTA in six arteries (DSA < 50\%/CTA 50 to 75\%). Factors that may contribute to these differences include impaired renal function and possibly "underestimation" of ostial RAS by arteriography. One artery not evaluable by arteriography showed a 70\% stenosis by CTA. CTA showed no major side effects. We conclude that CTA has the same accuracy for the diagnosis of RAS > or = 50\% as arteriography. However, CTA is only minimally invasive, safe, and causes less discomfort to patients.},

  abstract = {The Pix2pix and CycleGAN losses have vastly improved the qualitative and quantitative visual quality of results in image-to-image translation tasks. We extend this framework by exploring approximately invertible architectures which are well suited to these losses. These architectures are approximately invertible by design and thus partially satisfy cycle-consistency before training even begins. Furthermore, since invertible architectures have constant memory complexity in depth, these models can be built arbitrarily deep. We are able to demonstrate superior quantitative output on the Cityscapes and Maps datasets.

                             Additionally, we show that the model allows us to perform several memory-intensive medical imaging tasks, including a super-resolution problem on 3D MRI brain volumes. We also demonstrate that our model can perform a 3D domain-adaptation and 3D super-resolution task on chest CT volumes. By doing this, we provide a proof-of-principle for using reversible networks to create a model capable of pre-processing 3D CT scans to high resolution with a standardized appearance.},

IVIM parameters included perfusion fraction (PF), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), true diffusion coefficient (D), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Model-free DCE-MR parameters included time to peak (TTP), upslope, and initial area under the curve at 60 seconds (IAUC60). A dual input single compartmental perfusion model yielded arterial flow (Fa), portal venous flow (Fp), arterial fraction (ART), mean transit time (MTT), and distribution volume (DV). The diagnostic performances for diagnosis of cirrhosis were evaluated for each modality alone and in combination using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses. IVIM and DCE-MR parameters were compared using a generalized estimating equations model.PF, D*, D, and ADC values were significantly lower in cirrhosis (P = 0.0056-0.0377), whereas TTP, DV, and MTT were significantly increased in cirrhosis (P = 0.0006-0.0154). There was no correlation between IVIM- and DCE-MRI parameters. The highest Az (areas under the curves) values were observed for ADC (0.808) and TTP-DV (0.952 for each). The combination of ADC with DV and TTP provided 84.6\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity for diagnosis of cirrhosis.The combination of DW-MRI and DCE-MRI provides an accurate diagnosis of cirrhosis.},

  title = {Robust segmentation of the cranial cavity in non-contrast CT and CT perfusion of the brain},
  booktitle = ECR,
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {PURPOSE
                             Cranial cavity segmentation in CT is the essential first step for subsequent image processing and automated detection of cerebral pathology. This becomes complicated in the presence of skull fractures, metallic foreign objects or due to connected soft tissues such as the orbit. A robust and accurate method is presented to segment the cranial cavity in CT images.
                             METHOD AND MATERIALS
                             We propose a multi-atlas based method that uses atlas selection based on anterior skull variations, followed by a two-stage levelset refinement. The method was developed using a set of 99 non-contrast CT and 18 CT perfusion (CTP) scans obtained for emergency indications on a 320-row detector CT scanner. It was evaluated on a different set of 200 non-contrast CT and 100 CTP scans obtained for the same indications. Quality of segmentations was visually assessed. The reference standard consisted of three randomly selected orthogonal slices per patient that were manually annotated by trained observers. The corresponding slices were extracted and compared to the reference standard. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (95% HD) were reported.
                             RESULTS
                             The segmentation results were evaluated as very good to excellent. The method achieved a mean DSC of 0.98 +- 0.03 and mean 95% HD of 0.60 +- 2.15 mm in comparison to the reference standard.
                             CONCLUSION
                             The proposed method is capable of accurate segmentation of the cranial cavity in non-contrast CT and CTP independent of gross pathology or foreign objects. The method provides a fundamental first step towards automated evaluation of cranial CT.},

  abstract = {Segmentation of anatomical structures is fundamental in the development of computer aided diagnosis systems for cerebral pathologies. Manual annotations are laborious, time consuming and subject to human error and observer variability. Accurate quantification of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be employed as a morphometric measure for diagnosis and patient outcome prediction. However, segmenting CSF in non-contrast CT images is complicated by low soft tissue contrast and image noise. In this paper we propose a state-of-the-art method using a multi-scale three-dimensional (3D) fully convolution neural network (CNN) to automatically segment all CSF within the cranial cavity. The method is trained on a small dataset comprised of four manually annotated cerebral CT images. Quantitative evaluation of a separate test dataset of four images shows a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.87 +- 0.01 and mean absolute volume difference of 4.77 +- 2.70%. The average prediction time was 68 seconds. Our method allows for fast and fully automated 3D segmentation of cerebral CSF in non-contrast CT images, and shows promising results despite a limited amount of training data.},

The database covers a large spectrum of the anatomical and pathological variations that is typically observed in everyday clinical practice. Three orthogonal slices were randomly selected per patient and manually annotated, resulting in 1659 reference annotations.

Fast and accurate detection of intracranial hemorrhage can aid treating physicians by not only expediting and guiding diagnosis, but also supporting choices for secondary imaging, treatment and intervention. However, the automatic detection of intracranial hemorrhage is complicated by the variation in appearance on non-contrast CT images as a result of differences in etiology and location. We propose a method using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the automatic detection of intracranial hemorrhage. The method is trained on a dataset comprised of cerebral CT studies for which the presence of hemorrhage has been labeled for each axial slice. A separate test dataset of 20 images is used for quantitative evaluation and shows a sensitivity of 0.87, specificity of 0.97 and accuracy of 0.95. The average processing time for a single three-dimensional (3D) CT volume was 2.7 seconds.

There is a large trade-off between network architecture and input image size. For this reason, identification and classification tasks are commonly approached with patch or region based methods often utilizing only local contextual information during training and at inference. Here, a method is presented for the identification of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in three-dimensional (3D) non-contrast computed tomography (CT). The method combines a convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network in the form of bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) for ICH identification at image level. A convolutional neural network is trained for the identification of ICH in axial slices. LSTM is used to analyze the sequential information obtained from slice level classifications. The method is trained end-to-end using full high-resolution 3D non-contrast CTs. At inference it produces a binary classification with respect to the presence of ICH. A total of 1554 cranial CTs were used to train and validate the method and a separate dataset of 386 images was used for testing. Quantitative analysis showed an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96. The average time to classification was approximately 0.5 seconds. classification of whole 3D images is therefore possible without the need for pre-processing.},

  abstract = {With 1.6 million deaths in 2012, is lung cancer the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Lung cancer can be divided into two main sub-types. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with NSCLC making up about 85% of all cases.  For a long time chemotherapy has been the only line of treatment for NSCLC patients. Immunotherapy by the drug pembrolizumab is a novel range of treatment that aims to improve the body's own immune system in order to allow it to successfully fight the cancer. Unfortunately, not all patient respond to this treatment and patient selection plays therefore an important role. PD-L1 expression is currently the only biomarker that is used to estimate the efficacy of treatment with pembrolizumab. The amount of PD-L1 expression is measured in the Tumor Proportion Score (TPS). This is a ratio between cells that show membrane staining and cells that do not show this membrane staining. Before the treatment with pembrolizumab it is required that the TPS is estimated. Estimating the TPS is a difficult and time-consuming task for pathologists.  Furthermore, pathologist scoring suffers from interobserver variability. This results in a need for a reliable, robust automated method to estimate the TPS. In this work, three conceptually different neural networks are presented aiming for the automatic classification and location of  PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumor cells and immune cells.},

Quantitative CT perfusion (CTP) can provide additional diagnostic information compared to the limited accuracy of the current standard, contrast-enhanced CT (CECT). This systematic review evaluates CTP for diagnosis, grading, and treatment assessment of PDAC. The secondary goal is to provide an overview of scan protocols and perfusion models used for CTP in PDAC. The search strategy combined synonyms for 'CTP' and 'PDAC.' Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically searched from January 2000 to December 2020 for studies using CTP to evaluate PDAC. The risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS-2. 607 abstracts were screened, of which 29 were selected for full-text eligibility. 21 studies were included in the final analysis with a total of 760 patients. All studies comparing PDAC with non-tumorous parenchyma found significant CTP-based differences in blood flow (BF) and blood volume (BV). Two studies found significant differences between pathological grades. Two other studies showed that BF could predict neoadjuvant treatment response. A wide variety in kinetic models and acquisition protocol was found among included studies. Quantitative CTP shows a potential benefit in PDAC diagnosis and can serve as a tool for pathological grading and treatment assessment; however, clinical evidence is still limited. To improve clinical use, standardized acquisition and reconstruction parameters are necessary for interchangeability of the perfusion parameters.},

  abstract = {The clinical use of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems is increasing. A possible limitation of CAD systems is that they are typically trained on data from a small number of sources and as a result, they may not perform optimally on data from different sources. In particular for chest radiographs, it is known that acquisition settings, detector technology, proprietary post-processing and, in the case of analog images, digitization, can all influence the appearance and statistical properties of the image. In this work we investigate if a simple energy normalization procedure is sufficient to increase the robustness of CAD in chest radiography. We evaluate the performance of a supervised lung segmentation algorithm, trained with data from one type of machine, on twenty images each from five different sources. The results, expressed in terms of Jaccard index, increase from 0.530 A,A+- 0.290 to 0.914 A,A+- 0.041 when energy normalization is omitted or applied, respectively. We conclude that energy normalization is an effective way to make the performance of lung segmentation satisfactory on data from different sources.},

  title = {Robust Computer-Aided Detection of Tuberculosis in Chest Radiographs Using Energy Normalization},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {PURPOSE The performance of computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithms for chest radiography can be influenced by variations in image data coming from different sources. Acquisition settings, detector technology and proprietary post-processing all influence the appearance of radiographs. We developed an algorithm to standardize the appearance of chest radiographs (CXRs) in order to remove these variations prior to image analysis and evaluated its utility for a CAD system aimed at tuberculosis (TB) detection. METHOD AND MATERIALS Three data sets of 200 digital CXRs were used: 100 normal / 100 abnormal cases from an Odelca DR system acquired in Zambia; 100 normal / 100 abnormal cases from a digital Atomed mobile X-ray system acquired in The Gambia; 127 normal / 73 abnormal cases from a Philips Digital Diagnost system acquired in the United Kingdom. Reference standard for suspicion of TB was set by an expert reader. To standardize the appearance of CXRs, the image is decomposed into frequency bands using hierarchical unsharp masking. In a training set the average energy (standard deviation) of each frequency band in the central part of the image is determined. Each energy band is scaled to this reference energy, and the input image is reconstructed from the scaled frequency bands. Subsequently the lung fields and mediastinum are segmented via pixel classification and the energy normalization is repeated for region containing the union of lung fields and mediastinum. Cases were processed by a CAD system (CAD4TB v3.07, Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Nijmegen, The Netherlands) with and without applying the energy normalization method. This CAD system was trained with cases from an Odelca DR system. Performance was measured as area under the ROC curve (Az). Pairwise comparisons were made with bootstrap estimation, considering p<0.05 significant. RESULTS Without normalization, CAD4TB obtained an Az of 0.80, 0.61 and 0.47 for the data from Zambia, The Gambia, and the United Kingdom, respectively. With normalization, Az increased to 0.87, 0.80 and 0.84. Differences for the data from The Gambia and the United Kingdom were significant. CONCLUSION The robustness of CAD for detection of signs of TB on CXRs is improved by standardizing the radiographs prior to analysis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION An automated reading system for CXRs that can be used reliably on data from any digital unit has great potential in TB screening and active case finding.},

  abstract = {Automated quantitative analysis systems for medical images often lack the capability to successfully process images from multiple sources. Normalization of such images prior to further analysis is a possible solution to this limitation. This work presents a general method to normalize medical images and thoroughly investigates its effectiveness for chest radiography (CXR). The method starts with an energy decomposition of the image in different bands. Next, each band's localized energy is scaled to a reference value and the image is reconstructed. We investigate iterative and local application of this technique. The normalization is applied iteratively to the lung fields on six datasets from different sources, each comprising 50 normal CXRs and 50 abnormal CXRs. The method is evaluated in three supervised computer-aided detection tasks related to CXR analysis and compared to two reference normalization methods. In the first task, automatic lung segmentation, the average Jaccard overlap significantly increased from 0:720:30 and 0:870:11 for both reference methods to 0:89 0:09 (p < 0:01) with normalization. The second experiment was aimed at segmentation of the clavicles. The reference methods had an average Jaccard index of 0:570:26 and 0:530:26; with normalization this significantly increased to 0:68 0:23 (p < 0:01). The third experiment was detection of tuberculosis related abnormalities in the lung fields. The average area under the Receiver Operating Curve increased significantly from 0:720:14 and 0:790:06 using the reference methods to 0:85 0:05 (p < 0:01) with normalization. We conclude that the normalization can be successfully applied in chest radiography and makes supervised systems more generally applicable to data from different sources.},

  title = {Objective Computerized Chest Radiography Screening to Detect Tuberculosis in the Philippines},
  booktitle = {Union World Conference on Lung Health},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Background In the Palawan provincial areas of The Philippines, screening for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is performed in a WHO project by symptom screening combined with chest radiography; if at least one of these is positive, subjects undergo molecular Xpert testing. However, interpreting chest radiographs (CXRs) requires skilled personnel whose availability is limited and training is expensive and logistically challenging. Computerized reading is a potential solution: CXRs are objectively interpreted by software for the presence of TB related abnormalities. Operational costs are minimal and a result is available within one minute. We retrospectively engaged computerized reading in the DetecTB (Diagnostic Enhanced Tools for Extra Cases of TB) project, an intensified case finding program targeting prison settings and high-risk communities on Palawan Island in the Philippines. Methods A retrospective study was carried out on all cases in the DetecTB program available mid 2014. We compared the performance of CAD4TB v4.10, a commercially available software package, against the performance of the physicianAC/a,!a,,C/s readings. CAD4TB scores a posterior-anterior CXR for TB related abnormalities on a scale from 0 (normal) to 100 (abnormal). We performed Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to compare the computerized and human reading and visually inspected CXRs marked as normal by the physician but as highly suspicious by the software. Results In total, 12,256 radiographs were available for analysis. The number of cases positively read by the physicians was 3,068 (25.0%). 379 subjects (3.1%) tested positive on Xpert. Defining these cases as positive, and the remaining cases as negative, the area under the ROC curve (Az) achieved by CAD4TB v4.10 was 0.911 [CI: 0.895-0.926]. The software achieved 90.0% sensitivity at 80.0% specificity. The physician had a sensitivity of 97.6% and a specificity of 93.1%, which is slightly better than the software. However, this reading is biased as cases that were considered normal by the physician were considered negative by definition in our study design. An independent human observer considered 78 out of the 100 cases read as normal by the physician with the highest CAD4TB scores to be abnormal. Conclusion Computerized reading provides high sensitivity and specificity and may be used to assist or possibly replace a human reader in active case finding programs, and thus improve screening throughput.},

Therefore, alternative approaches are needed. We evaluated automated digital chest radiography (ACR) as a rapid and cheap pre-screen test prior to Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert). 388 suspected TB subjects underwent chest radiography, Xpert and sputum culture testing. Radiographs were analysed by computer software (CAD4TB) and specialist readers, and abnormality scores were allocated. A triage algorithm was simulated in which subjects with a score above a threshold underwent Xpert. We computed sensitivity, specificity, cost per screened subject (CSS), cost per notified TB case (CNTBC) and throughput for different diagnostic thresholds. 18.3% of subjects had culture positive TB. For Xpert alone, sensitivity was 78.9%, specificity 98.1%, CSS $13.09 and CNTBC $90.70. In a pre-screening setting where 40% of subjects would undergo Xpert, CSS decreased to $6.72 and CNTBC to $54.34, with eight TB cases missed and throughput increased from 45 to 113 patients/day. Specialists, on average, read 57% of radiographs as abnormal, reducing CSS ($8.95) and CNTBC ($64.84). ACR pre-screening could substantially reduce costs, and increase daily throughput with few TB cases missed. These data inform public health policy in resource-constrained settings.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top 10 leading causes of death worldwide, now ranking above HIV/AIDS. Despite the fact that with timely diagnosis and correct treatment most people who develop TB can be cured, a staggering 1.7 million were estimated to have died from the disease in 2016, and a total of 10.7 million people fell ill. The World Health Organization's "End TB strategy? was initiated in 2016 to end the global TB epidemic with targets of 80% TB incidence decrease and 90% decrease in TB deaths by 2030. In order to reach these targets, early detection needs to be improved and new screening tools and diagnostic algorithms are needed. One of the tools for the detection of TB that has gained momentum in resource constrained countries in recent years is digital chest radiography. After the initial investment in the equipment, radiography is fast and cheap, it has high sensitivity and it can have a large throughput. However, as a direct consequence of the increased usage of chest X-ray, the lack of well trained personnel to read chest radiographs (CXRs) has become even more apparent. In this thesis, we have focused on improving various aspects of the computer-aided detection for TB (CAD4TB) software, and we have validated and analyzed the effectiveness of the software in various settings.},

To evaluate the performance of TB detection based on computerised chest radiography (CXR) readings.  Data from 14 094 subjects were analysed from September 2012 to June 2014. All CXRs were read by a physician and by software. Individuals with TB symptoms or CXR abnormalities according to the physician underwent Xpert  MTB/RIF testing, the remaining persons were considered TB-negative (screening reference). A subset of 200 CXRs was read by an independent human reader (radiological reference). This reader also re-read a subset of the most abnormal cases as identified using the software but read as normal by the physician (discordant cases).  A total of 10 755 individuals were included in the analysis, 2534 of whom had a positively assessed CXR; 298 cases were Xpert-positive. Using the screening reference, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for software readings was 0.93 (95%CI 0.92-0.94), with a sensitivity of 0.98 (95%CI 0.97-0.99) and a specificity of 0.69 (95%CI 0.40-0.98). Based on the radiological reference, the physician performed slightly worse than the software (sensitivity, 0.82, 95%CI 0.74-0.89 and specificity, 0.87, 95%CI 0.81-0.96 vs. sensitivity, 0.83, 95%CI 0.71-0.93 and specificity, 0.87, 95%CI 0.75-0.95), although this was not statistically significant. Of the 291 discordant cases, 70% were assessed as positive, resulting in a 22% increase in TB detection when extrapolated to the full cohort.  The performance of automated CXR reading is comparable to that of the attending physicians in DetecTB, and its use as a second reader could increase TB detection.},

  abstract = {Prostate cancer is the most common cancer for men in Western countries, counting 1.1 million new diagnoses every year. The incidence is expected to increase further, due to the growing elderly population. This is leading to a significantly increased workload for pathologists. The burden of this time-consuming and repetitive workload has the potential to be decreased by computational pathology, e.g., by automatically screening prostate biopsies. The current state-of-the-art in many computational pathology tasks use patch-based convolutional neural networks. Developing such algorithms require detailed annotations of the task-specific classes on whole-slide images, which are challenging to create due to low availability of the pathologists. Therefore, it would be beneficial to be able to train using labels the pathologist already provides for regular clinical practice in the form of a report. However, these reports correspond to whole-slide images which are of such a high resolution that current accelerator cards cannot process them at once due to memory constraints. We developed a method, streaming stochastic gradient descent, to train a convolutional neural network end-to-end with entire high resolution images and slide-level labels extracted from pathology reports. Here we trained a neural network on 2812 whole prostate biopsies, at a input size of 8000x8000 pixels, equivalent to 50x total magnification, for a binary classification, cancerous or benign. We achieved an accuracy of 84%. These results show that we may not need expensive annotations to train classification networks in this domain.},

  abstract = {Due to memory constraints on current hardware, most convolution neural networks (CNN) are trained on sub-megapixel images. For example, most popular datasets in computer vision contain images much less than a megapixel in size (0.09MP for ImageNet and 0.001MP for CIFAR-10). In some domains such as medical imaging, multi-megapixel images are needed to identify the presence of disease accurately. We propose a novel method to directly train CNNs using any input image size end-to-end. This method exploits the locality of most operations in modern CNNs by performing the forward and backward pass on smaller tiles of the image. In this work, we show a proof of concept using images of up to 66-megapixels (8192x8192), saving approximately 50GB of memory per image. Using two public challenge datasets, we demonstrate that CNNs can learn to extract relevant information from these large images and benefit from increasing resolution. We improved the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve from 0.580 (4MP) to 0.706 (66MP) for metastasis detection in breast cancer (CAMELYON17). We also obtained a Spearman correlation metric approaching state-of-the-art performance on the TUPAC16 dataset, from 0.485 (1MP) to 0.570 (16MP).

  abstract = {Prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer among men in Western countries, with 1.1 million new diagnoses every year. The gold standard for the diagnosis of prostate cancer is a pathologists' evaluation of prostate tissue. To potentially assist pathologists deep-learning-based cancer detection systems have been developed. Many of the state-of-the-art models are patch-based convolutional neural networks, as the use of entire scanned slides is hampered by memory limitations on accelerator cards. Patch-based systems typically require detailed, pixel-level annotations for effective training. However, such annotations are seldom readily available, in contrast to the clinical reports of pathologists, which contain slide-level labels. As such, developing algorithms which do not require manual pixel-wise annotations, but can learn using only the clinical report would be a significant advancement for the field. In this paper, we propose to use a streaming implementation of convolutional layers, to train a modern CNN (ResNet-34) with 21 million parameters end-to-end on 4712 prostate biopsies. The method enables the use of entire biopsy images at high-resolution directly by reducing the GPU memory requirements by 2.4 TB. We show that modern CNNs, trained using our streaming approach, can extract meaningful features from high-resolution images without additional heuristics, reaching similar performance as state-of-the-art patch-based and multiple-instance learning methods. By circumventing the need for manual annotations, this approach can function as a blueprint for other tasks in histopathological diagnosis.

  abstract = {Background: The first sign of metastatic prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy is rising PSA levels in the blood, termed biochemical recurrence. The prediction of recurrence relies mainly on the morphological assessment of prostate cancer using the Gleason grading system. However, in this system, within-grade morphological patterns and subtle histopathological features are currently omitted, leaving a significant amount of prognostic potential unexplored.
   Methods: To discover additional prognostic information using artificial intelligence, we trained a deep learning system to predict biochemical recurrence from tissue in H\&E-stained microarray cores directly. We developed a morphological biomarker using convolutional neural networks leveraging a nested case-control study of 685 patients and validated on an independent cohort of 204 patients. We use concept-based explainability methods to interpret the learned tissue patterns.
   Results: The biomarker provides a strong correlation with biochemical recurrence in two sets (n = 182 and n = 204) from separate institutions. Concept-based explanations provided tissue patterns interpretable by pathologists.
   Conclusions: These results show that the model finds predictive power in the tissue beyond the morphological ISUP grading.},

The results from the study are applicable in image analysis applications such as wide baseline matching, texture recognition, object retrieval, robot localization, video data mining, building panorama?s object class recognition and object location and pose retrieval. Over the years many different methods have been developed for these tasks and a number of these methods function well in specific areas of image analysis. However a trend in these methods is that they depend more and more on ad hoc parameters and thresholds. These parameters are often not representing a physical entity and it is therefore difficult to assign meaningful values to them. The approach often used to ?solve? this problem is extensive training that exhaustively tries all possible parameters within a certain range and simply choses the parameter set yielding the best results for the training set of images. This results in algorithms that work well for the image modality for which they were trained, but as soon as the input images differ too much from the training set, these algorithms break down. The goal of the research described in this thesis is to find a general method for image matching, regardless of the type of input images. Our method has to have a reasonable physical motivation and should have as few parameters and thresholds as possible.},

We obtained two different dynamic contrast-enhanced MR image series per study; one with high spatial and one with high temporal resolution. Six morphological descriptors were determined from an automatic segmentation of the lesion. Eight kinetic curve features were derived from the high spatial resolution data and six pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from the high temporal resolution data.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Common computerized differentiation algorithms for breast masses use morphological and kinetic curve features from high spatial resolution DCEMR images. We assess the performance change when these features are combined with pharmacokinetic features derived from a specialized dual-temporal resolution MR protocol. METHOD AND MATERIALS: All patients with enhancing masses from a consecutive set of breast MR studies, acquired between 2008 and 2010 on a Sonata or Symphony 1.5T Siemens scanner, were included. This resulted in a cohort of 93 patients, with 66 benign and 67 malignant lesions (validated by biopsy). Our scanning protocol combined high temporal with high spatial resolution imaging. High temporal resolution (HT) images were acquired every 4.5s using a 3D TurboFLASH sequence (TR 7.8ms, TE 4ms, FA 20A-A?A 1/2 , FOV 320mm) during initial enhancement. Additional 4.5s scans were made every 110s to observe late behavior of the contrast agent. High spatial resolution (HS) images were acquired every 110s using a 3D FLASH sequence (TR 72ms, TE 1.54ms, FA 20A-A?A 1/2 , FOV 320mm). Each lesion was automatically segmented using 'smart opening'; a combination of thresholds, region growing and morphological operations. Every lesion was characterized by a set of 6 morphological and 8 kinetic features derived from HS and 3 pharmacokinetic features derived from HT. An SVM classifier with a radial basis function kernel was used. Ten-fold cross-validation was executed 10 times. Performance was measured by the area under the ROC curve, Az. RESULTS: The accuracy of the combined HS and HT kinetic features was significantly better (Az=0.81, p<0.02) than either the HS or HT kinetic features alone (Az=0.77 and 0.71 respectively). The commonly used combination of morphological and kinetic features from HS showed a diagnostic performance of Az=0.85. The addition of pharmacokinetic features from HT increased this performance significantly (Az=0.88, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Pharmacokinetic features obtained from a high temporal resolution DCEMR sequence provide additional information over conventional morphological and kinetic features from a high spatial resolution sequence. Combining these features leads to significantly better performance for computerized differentiation of breast masses. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: Dual temporal resolution breast MR can improve diagnostic accuracy over conventional single resolution analysis, which can increase specificity.},

The purpose of this study is to introduce novel features extracted from the kinetics of contrast agent uptake imaged by a short (100~s) view-sharing MRI protocol, and to investigate how these features measure up to commonly used features for regular DCE-MRI of the breast. Performance is measured with a computer aided diagnosis (CADx) system aimed at distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. A bi-temporal breast MRI protocol was used. This protocol produces five regular, high spatial-resolution T1-weighted acquisitions interleaved with a series of 20 ultrafast view-sharing acquisitions during contrast agent uptake. We measure and compare the performances of morphological and kinetic features derived from both the regular DCE-MRI sequence and the ultrafast view-sharing sequence with four different classifiers. The classification performance of kinetics derived from the short (100~s) ultrafast acquisition starting with contrast agent administration, is significantly higher than the performance of kinetics derived from a much lengthier (510~s), commonly used 3D gradient echo acquisition. When combined with morphology information all classifiers show a higher performance for the ultrafast acquisition (two out of four results are significantly better},

  abstract = {Objectives
                             Airway wall thickness (AWT) is affected by changes in lung volume. This study evaluated whether correcting AWT on computed tomography (CT) for differences in inspiration level improves measurement agreement, reliability, and power to detect changes over time.

                             Methods
                             Participants of the Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening trial who underwent 3-month repeat CT for an indeterminate pulmonary nodule were included. AWT on CT was calculated by the square root of the wall area at a theoretical airway with an internal perimeter of 10?mm (Pi10). The scan with the highest lung volume was labelled as the reference scan and the scan with the lowest lung volume was labelled as the comparison scan. Pi10 derived from the comparison scan was corrected by multiplying it with the ratio of CT lung volume of the comparison scan to CT lung volume on the reference scan. Agreement of uncorrected and corrected Pi10 was studied with the Bland-Altman method, reliability with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), and power to detect changes over time was calculated.

                             Results
                             315 male participants were included. Limit of agreement and reliability for Pi10 was ?0.61 to 0.57?mm (ICC?=?0.87), which improved to ?0.38 to 0.37?mm (ICC?=?0.94) after correction for inspiration level. To detect a 15% change over 3 months, 71 subjects are needed for Pi10 and 26 subjects for Pi10 adjusted for inspiration level.

                             Conclusions
                             Correcting Pi10 for differences in inspiration level improves reliability, agreement, and power to detect changes over time.},

A chest radiologist and a radiology resident blinded to the outcome independently scored baseline CT scans visually and qualitatively for the presence of emphysema, airway wall thickening and fibrotic lung disease. The prevalence of CT abnormalities was compared between cases and controls by using chi-squared tests. In total, 167 participants died from a respiratory cause other than lung cancer. The prevalence of severe emphysema, airway wall thickening and fibrotic lung disease were 28.7\% versus 4.8\%, 26.9\% versus 13.2\% and 18.6\% versus 0.5\% in cases and controls, respectively. Radiological findings were significantly more prevalent in deaths compared with controls (all p<0.001).

The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability of using whole slide images as compared with routine glass slides for diagnostic purposes.

Two pathologists scored the digital images of biopsies in a primary diagnostic setting. For each case, the consensus diagnosis was de?ned as the majority diagnosis on the study's glass slides. All diagnoses were grouped into seven main diagnostic categories, and further divided into subgroups. The overall concor

The concordance rates of the subgroups 'adenoma' and 'adenocarcinoma' between whole slide images and conventional microscopy showed only small variability. The intraobserver (whole slide images versus glass slide) agreement, including subgroups, was substantial, with a mean j-value of 0.78, and was higher than the interobserver agreement for glass slides (interobserver j-value of 0.69). Conclusions: This study shows good diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility for virtual microscopy, indicating that this technology can reliably be used for pathological evaluation of colon biopsies in a primary clinical setting.},

Goals of processing are to reduce the dynamic range of the image data to capture the full range of attenuation differences between lungs and mediastinum, to improve the modulation transfer function to optimize spatial resolution, to enhance structural contrast, and to suppress image noise. Image processing comprises look-up table operations and spatial filtering. Look-up table operations allow for automated signal normalization and arbitrary choice of image gradation. The most simple and still widely applied spatial filtering algorithms are based on unsharp masking. Various modifications were introduced for dynamic range reduction and MTF restoration. More elaborate and more effective are multi-scale frequency processing algorithms. They are based on the subdivision of an image in multiple frequency bands according to its structural composition. This allows for a wide range of image manipulations including a size-independent enhancement of low-contrast structures. Principles of the various algorithms will be explained and their impact on image appearance will be illustrated by clinical examples. Optimum and sub-optimum parameter settings are discussed and pitfalls will be explained.},

Methods The Dutch Radiological Society (NVvR) developed CO-RADS based on other efforts for standardization, such as Lung-RADS or BI-RADS. CO-RADS assesses the suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on a scale from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). The system is meant to be used in patients presenting with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19. The system was evaluated using 105 chest CTs of patients admitted to the hospital with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 in whom RT-PCR was performed (62 +/- 16 years, 61 men, 53 with positive RT-PCR). Eight observers assessed the scans using CO-RADS. Fleiss' kappa was calculated, and scores of individual observers were compared to the median of the remaining seven observers. The resulting area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was compared to results from RT-PCR and clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Results There was absolute agreement among observers in 573 (68.2%) of 840 observations. Fleiss' kappa was 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.47), with the highest kappa for CO-RADS categories 1 (0.58, 95% CI 0.54-0.62) and 5 (0.68, 95% CI 0.65-0.72). The average AUC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97) for predicting RT-PCR outcome and 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.99) for clinical diagnosis. The false negative rate for CO-RADS 1 was 9/161 (5.6%, 95% CI 1.0-10%), and the false positive rate for CO-RADS 5 was 1/286 (0.3%, 95% CI 0-1.0%). Conclusions CO-RADS is a categorical assessment scheme for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on non-enhanced chest CT providing very good performance for predicting COVID-19 in patients with moderate to severe symptoms and has a substantial interobserver agreement, especially for categories 1 and 5.},

Given a problem-adapted examination technique, pathologic changes in vessels of as little as 2 mm can be visualized. In some cases with complex vascular anatomy, spiral CT angiography can be superior to arterial angiography.},

  abstract = {Observer performance with four unsharp mask filtering algorithms for storage phosphor chest radiographs was compared with that with conventional screen-film radiographs in the detection of three types of simulated lung disease: nodules, fine lines, and micronodule clusters. Previously studied parameter sets (small [1.4-mm] and medium [5-mm] filter masks) and two new parameter sets (large [2.5-cm] and ultralarge [7-cm] masks) were compared by means of receiver operating characteristic analysis. With medium and small masks, nodule detection was inferior to that achieved with other modes. Use of ultralarge masks decreased the detection of lines compared with detection with conventional screen-film radiographs. Although detection of micronodule clusters was worse with digital images than with conventional screen-film radiographs, results with large and ultralarge masks were better than with small masks. Overall, filtering with large masks was best suited for simultaneously matching linear, nodular, and micronodular structures. These results suggest that lesion-specific processing of digital chest images is not necessary.},

  abstract = {Maximum intensity projection (MIP) is a simple three-dimensional visualization tool that can be used to display computed tomographic angiography data sets. MIP images are not threshold dependent and preserve attenuation information. Thus, they often yield acceptable results even in cases in which shaded surface display images fail because of threshold problems. MIP is particularly useful for depicting small vessels. Because MIP does not allow for differentiation between foreground and background, MIP images are best suited for displaying relatively simple anatomic situations in which superimposition of structures does not occur (eg, the abdominal aorta). If anatomic structures are superimposed over the vessel of interest, the MIP technique can provide images of diagnostic quality as long as the contrast of the vessel of interest is sufficiently high compared with that of surrounding structures. Editing procedures for MIP are usually used to exclude unwanted structures from the volume of interest and include cutting functions and region-growing algorithms. Artifacts from vessel pulsation and respiratory motion may occur and simulate abnormalities, but, with careful attention, they can be distinguished from real disease. MIP images should always be interpreted together with the original transaxial data set. Knowledge of display properties and artifacts is necessary for correct interpretation of MIP images and helps one create images of optimal quality, choose appropriate examination parameters, and distinguish artifacts from disease.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to survey the current CT protocols used by members of the European Society of Thoracic Imaging (ESTI) to evaluate patients with interstitial lung diseases (ILD). METHODS: A questionnaire was e-mailed to 173 ESTI members. The survey focussed on CT acquisition and reconstruction techniques. In particular, questions referred to the use of discontinuous HRCT or volume CT protocols, the acquisition of additional acquisitions in expiration or in the prone position, and methods of radiation dose reduction and on reconstruction algorithms. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 37 \%. Eighty-five percent of the respondents used either volume CT alone or in combination with discontinuous HRCT. Forty-five percent of the respondents adapt their CT protocols to the patient's weight and/or age. Expiratory CT or CT in the prone position was performed by 58 \% and 59 \% of the respondents, respectively. The number of reconstructed series ranged from two to eight. CONCLUSION: Our survey showed that radiologists with a special interest and experience in chest radiology use a variety of CT protocols for the evaluation of ILD. There is a clear preference for volumetric scans and a strong tendency to use the 3D information. KEY POINTS: AC/a,!AC/ Experienced thoracic radiologists use various CT protocols for evaluating interstitial lung diseases. AC/a,!AC/ Most workers prefer volumetric CT acquisitions, making use of the 3D information AC/a,!AC/ More attention to reducing the radiation dose appears to be needed.},

Today effective medical CBIR systems are limited to specific applications, as to reduce the amount of medical knowledge to model. Although supervised approaches could ease the incorporation of medical expertise, its application is not common due to the scarce number of available user annotations. This paper introduces the application of radiology reports to supervise CBIR systems. The concept is to make use of the textual distances between reports to build a transformation in image space through a manifold learning algorithm. A comparison was made between the presented approach and non-supervised CBIR systems, using a Leave-One- Patient-Out evaluation in a database of computer tomography scans of interstitial lung diseases. Supervised CBIR augmented the mean average precision consistently with an increase between 3 to 8 points, which suggests supervision by radiology reports increases CBIR performance.},

Computer aided diagnosis systems often study the automatic identification of CT patterns, using the division of the lung in volumes of interest and the use of supervised classification. Despite moderate success, this approach has been hampered by the shortage of medical annotations available to research groups. We propose a new method that collects exams that contain CT patterns through the presence of keywords in radiology reports, to learn pattern models using a multiple instance learning algorithm. We compared our approach to the traditional use of volumes of interest annotations for six interstitial lung diseases patterns. The results show our approach performed comparatively in four of the studied patterns, and poorly for the other two. The results suggest that under certain conditions learning CT patterns from radiology reports is possible, which could foster developments in computer aided diagnosis systems.},

  abstract = {Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a search technology that could aid medical diagnosis by retrieving and presenting earlier reported cases that are related to the one being diagnosed. To retrieve relevant cases, CBIR systems depend on supervised learning to map low level image contents to high level diagnostic concepts. However, the annotation by medical doctors for training and evaluation purposes is a difficult and timeconsuming task, which restricts the supervised learning phase to specific CBIR problems of well defined clinical applications. This paper proposes a new technique that automatically learns the similarity between the several exams from textual distances extracted from radiology reports, thereby successfully reducing the number of annotations needed. Our method firstly infers the relation between patients by using information retrieval techniques to determine the textual distances between patient radiology reports. These distances are subsequently used to supervise a metric learning algorithm, that transforms the image space accordingly to textual distances. CBIR systems with different image descriptions and different levels of medical annotations were evaluated, with and without supervision from textual distances, using a database of computer tomography scans of patients with interstitial lung diseases. The proposed method consistently improves CBIR mean average precision, with improvements that can reach 38\%, and more marked gains for small annotation sets. Given the overall availability of radiology reports in Picture Archiving and Communication Systems, the proposed approach can be broadly applied to CBIR systems in different medical problems, and may facilitate the introduction of CBIR in clinical practice.},

We hypothesized that Leydig cells and ovarian stromal hyperplasia contribute to postmenopausal ovarian androgen production, and are observed more frequently in EEC patients. Ovaries of postmenopausal women with EEC (n=36) or non-endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (NEEC) (n=19) were examined for the presence of hilar Leydig cells, and compared with ovaries resected for benign conditions (n=22). Leydig cells were counted manually and a Leydig cell density was calculated per mm2 hilar surface. Ovarian stromal hyperplasia was scored as atrophic, moderate hyperplastic, or marked hyperplastic. In all endometrial carcinomas (ECs), these findings were correlated with the serum levels of sex steroids and hormone receptor expression in their ECs. In EEC patients, mean number of Leydig cells was 282.8 cells compared to 76.3 cells in NEEC patients and 66.4 cells in controls. Leydig cells, marked stromal hyperplasia, and combined presence were observed more frequently in EEC patients compared to NEEC and controls. Combined presence was associated with higher serum sex steroid levels and increased tumor expression of estrogen and progesterone receptor. A cut-off value for Leydig cell hyperplasia could be proposed at a total of 300 Leydig cells bilaterally, examining a representative cross-section of both hili. Concluding, we have quantified hilar Leydig cells and demonstrated that Leydig cells may contribute to the development of EEC by increased androgen production in postmenopausal women. The correlation between sex hormone levels and Leydig cell hyperplasia may support endometrial pathology screening in these women.},

Our method relies only on a rough selection of template areas of each vertebra in a single frame of the video sequence. Compared to existing automated methods, no contours need to be extracted and no vertebra segmentation is required. Tracking is done with a normalized gradient field, using only the gradient orientations as features. Experimental results show that the algorithm is robust and able to track the vertebrae accurately even if they are partially occluded or if a disc prosthesis is present.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of B-cell lymphoma. It is characterized by a heterogeneous morphology, genetic changes and clinical behavior. A small specific subgroup of DLBCL, harbouring a MYC gene translocation is associated with worse patient prognosis and outcome. Typically, the MYC translocation is assessed with a molecular test (FISH), that is expensive and time-consuming. Our hypothesis is that genetic changes, such as translocations could be visible as changes in the morphology of an HE-stained specimen. However, it has not proven possible to use morphological criteria for the detection of a MYC translocation in the diagnostic setting due to lack of specificity.
   In this paper, we apply a deep learning model to automate detection of the MYC translocations in DLBCL based on HE-stained specimens. The proposed method works at the whole-slide level and was developed based on a multicenter data cohort of 91 patients. All specimens were stained with HE, and the MYC translocation was confirmed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The system was evaluated on an additional 66 patients, and obtained AUROC of 0.83 and accuracy of 0.77. The proposed method presents proof of a concept giving insights in the applicability of deep learning methods for detection of a genetic changes in DLBCL. In future work we will evaluate our algorithm for automatic pre-screen of DLBCL specimens to obviate FISH analysis in a large number of patients.},

To address this need, we developed a sample-sparing, highly multiplexed immunohistochemistry technique based on iterative cycles of tagging, image scanning, and destaining of chromogenic substrate on a single slide. This assay, in combination with a newly developed automated digital landscaping solution, democratizes access to high-dimensional immunohistochemical analyses by capturing the complexity of the immunome using routine pathology standards. Applications of the method extend beyond cancer to screen and validate comprehensive panels of tissue-based prognostic and predictive markers, perform indepth in situ monitoring of therapies, and identify targets of disease.},

  abstract = {White matter lesions (WML) are diffuse white matter abnormalities commonly found in older subjects and are important indicators of stroke, multiple sclerosis, dementia and other disorders. We present an automated WML detection method and evaluate it on a dataset of small vessel disease (SVD) patients. In early SVD, small WMLs are expected to be of importance for the prediction of disease progression. Commonly used WML segmentation methods tend to ignore small WMLs and are mostly validated on the basis of total lesion load or a Dice coefficient for all detected WMLs. Therefore, in this paper, we present a method that is designed to detect individual lesions, large or small, and we validate the detection performance of our system with FROC (free-response ROC) analysis. For the automated detection, we use supervised classification making use of multimodal voxel based features from different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences, including intensities, tissue probabilities, voxel locations and distances, neighborhood textures and others. After preprocessing, including co-registration, brain extraction, bias correction, intensity normalization, and nonlinear registration, ventricle segmentation is performed and features are calculated for each brain voxel. A gentle-boost classifier is trained using these features from 50 manually annotated subjects to give each voxel a probability of being a lesion voxel. We perform ROC analysis to illustrate the benefits of using additional features to the commonly used voxel intensities; significantly increasing the area under the curve (Az) from 0.81 to 0.96 (p<0.05). We perform the FROC analysis by testing our classifier on 50 previously unseen subjects and compare the results with manual annotations performed by two experts. Using the first annotator results as our reference, the second annotator performs at a sensitivity of 0.90 with an average of 41 false positives per subject while our automated method reached the same level of sensitivity at approximately 180 false positives per subject.},

  abstract = {Purpose To quantify the reproducibility and accuracy of experienced thoracic radiologists in differentiating between subsolid and solid pulmonary nodules at CT. Materials and Methods The institutional review board of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center approved this multicenter study. Six thoracic radiologists, with a mean of 21 years of experience in thoracic radiology (range, 17-22 years), selected images of 10 solid and 10 subsolid nodules to create a database of 120 nodules; this selection served as the reference standard. Each radiologist then interpreted 120 randomly ordered nodules in two different sessions that were separated by a minimum of 3 weeks. The radiologists classified whether or not each nodule was subsolid. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was assessed with a AZAo statistic. The number of correct classifications was calculated and correlated with nodule size by using Bland-Altman plots. The relationship between disagreement and nodule morphologic characteristics was analyzed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results Interobserver agreement (AZAo) was 0.619 (range, 0.469-0.745; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.576, 0.663) and 0.670 (range, 0.440-0.839; 95\% CI: 0.608, 0.733) for interpretation sessions 1 and 2, respectively. Intraobserver agreement (AZAo) was 0.792 (95\% CI: 0.750, 0.833). Averaged for interpretation sessions, correct classification was achieved by all radiologists for 58\% (70 of 120) of nodules. Radiologists agreed with their initial determination (the reference standard) in 77\% of cases (range, 45\%-100\%). Nodule size weakly correlated with correct classification (long axis: Spearman rank correlation coefficient, rs = 0.161 and P = .049; short axis: rs = 0.128 and P = .163). Conclusion The reproducibility and accuracy of thoracic radiologists in classifying whether or not a nodule is subsolid varied in the retrospective study. This inconsistency may affect surveillance recommendations and prognostic determinations. (A,A(c)) RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

  title = {Impact of section thickness on classification of pulmonary nodules into solid, part-solid, and non-solid: an observer study},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {PURPOSE Recently published recommendations by the Fleischner Society differentiate between solid, part-solid, and non-solid nodules. A section thickness of 1mm is recommended for evaluation. It is, however, common practice to reconstruct thicker (3mm or 5mm) sections to reduce the number of sections to evaluate. Purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of section thickness on nodule classification agreement. METHOD AND MATERIALS 20 part-solid, 10 non-solid and 10 solid nodular lesions were randomly selected from the {NELSON} screening trial. A reference standard was established using the consensus reading of two experienced chest radiologists. Data had been acquired using a low dose (16x0.75mm, 120-140 kVp, 30 mAs) protocol. Complete {CT}s were shown with axial and coronal projections with either 1mm, 3mm or 5mm section thickness, the latter two with 1mm overlap. Readers could interactively scroll through the scans, use magnification, windowing and manual calibre measurements as warranted. Four readers of varying experience were asked to classify the lesions as solid (1), part-solid (2), or non-solid (3). All readings were done twice in six sessions, in which all permutations of nodules and section thicknesses were presented in different random orders. We report percentage agreement between observers and the consensus reference. All results stated are averaged over all reading sessions. RESULTS Mean agreement rate with the reference standard decreased from 85% (range 78-95%) to 77% (range 68-84%) and 75% (range 68-84%), for 1mm, 3mm, and 5mm section thickness, respectively. Readers were affected differently by increasing section thickness. The most experienced reader was influenced the least (agreement = 84-82-80%). Two readers demonstrated a major decrease in performance already for 3mm (81-72-70% and 91-78-81%). One reader showed a stepwise performance decline (86-77-69%). CONCLUSION Nodule classification is affected by section thickness. The degree of loss of accuracy appears to be reader dependent. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Nodule classification is impaired by increasing section thickness which may have consequences for patient management. Visual classification therefore requires acquisition and storage of 1mm sections.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Recently published recommendations by the Fleischner Society differentiate between non-solid and partsolid nodules. For the latter follow up or invasive diagnostic procedures are recommended depending on the size of the solid core. For solid nodules, different recommendations apply. We evaluated inter- and intra-reader variability of nodule classification and the impact on patient management. METHOD AND MATERIALS 20 part-solid, 10 non-solid and 10 solid nodular lesions were randomly selected from the {NELSON} screening trial. Data had been acquired using a low dose (16x0.75mm, 120-140 kVp, 30 mAs) protocol. Complete {CT}s were shown with axial and coronal projections with 1mm section thickness.

All readings were done twice in six sessions, in which all permutations of nodules and section thicknesses were presented in different random orders. Inter- and intra-reader agreement were calculated using CohenAC/a,!a,,C/s kappa statistics. To evaluate possible consequences on patient management, the number of differences between assigned scores of 1 or 2 (invasive diagnosis) and scores of 3 or 4 (follow up) were calculated. All results stated are averaged over all reading sessions. RESULTS Inter-reader agreement was low with mean kappa of 0.33 (range 0.02-0.58). Intra-reader agreement was moderate with mean kappa 0.54 (range 0.31-0.72). Patient management would have differed in 27% caused by interreader disagreement, and would have changed in 8% caused by intrareader variability. 28% of all nodules were uniformly classified over all reading sessions. Of these, 18% were classified as solid and 73% as non-solid. CONCLUSION Inter- and intra-reader agreement are low and moderate for the classification of pulmonary nodules according to Fleischner criteria if pure visual analysis is used. This may affect patient management. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Variability in nodule classification may have consequences on patient management; use of digital analysis tools appears to be necessary to improve classification.},

  abstract = {Purpose To examine the factors that affect inter- and intraobserver agreement for pulmonary nodule type classification on low-radiation-dose computed tomographic (CT) images, and their potential effect on patient management. Materials and Methods Nodules (n = 160) were randomly selected from the Dutch-Belgian Lung Cancer Screening Trial cohort, with equal numbers of nodule types and similar sizes. Nodules were scored by eight radiologists by using morphologic categories proposed by the Fleischner Society guidelines for management of pulmonary nodules as solid, part solid with a solid component smaller than 5 mm, part solid with a solid component 5 mm or larger, or pure ground glass. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was analyzed by using Cohen AZAo statistics. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed to assess the effect of nodule characteristics and image quality on observer disagreement. Effect on nodule management was estimated by differentiating CT follow-up for ground-glass nodules, solid nodules 8 mm or smaller, and part-solid nodules smaller than 5 mm from immediate diagnostic work-up for solid nodules larger than 8 mm and part-solid nodules 5 mm or greater. Results Pair-wise inter- and intraobserver agreement was moderate (mean AZAo, 0.51 [95\% confidence interval, 0.30, 0.68] and 0.57 [95\% confidence interval, 0.47, 0.71]). Categorization as part-solid nodules and location in the upper lobe significantly reduced observer agreement (P = .012 and P < .001, respectively). By considering all possible reading pairs (28 possible combinations of observer pairs AfaEUR? 160 nodules = 4480 possible agreements or disagreements), a discordant nodule classification was found in 36.4\% (1630 of 4480), related to presence or size of a solid component in 88.7\% (1446 of 1630). Two-thirds of these discrepant readings (1061 of 1630) would have potentially resulted in different nodule management. Conclusion There is moderate inter- and intraobserver agreement for nodule classification by using current recommendations for low-radiation-dose CT examinations of the chest. Discrepancies in nodule categorization were mainly caused by disagreement on the size and presence of a solid component, which may lead to different management in the majority of cases with such discrepancies.

  title = {{ACR} Lung-{RADS} guidelines for pure ground-glass nodules: is a threshold of 20mm adequate?},
  booktitle = {ECR},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Purpose: The ACR Lung-RADS for management of pulmonary nodules categorizes pure ground-glass nodules (GGN) into a 1 year (category 2) or 6 months (category 3) follow-up CT scan, using a cutoff value of 20mm as threshold. An analysis of GGNs categorized according to the Lung-RADS is presented. Methods and Materials: All pure GGNs from two sites of the NELSON screening trial were selected. Morphology was determined in the first CT scan they were annotated. Each nodule was considered only once. Diameter measurements were taken from the NELSON database. Nodules were categorized according to the ACR Lung-RADS, using the proposed threshold of 20mm. Changes in categorization were calculated when lowering the threshold to 15 and 10mm. Results: 86 GGNs were included, with 16 malignant GGNs (19%) including 9 invasive adenocarcinomas. For a 20mm threshold, only 2% of GGNs were assigned to Lung-RADS 3. For a 15mm threshold this increased to 16%; for a 10mm threshold to 53%. Of the 16 cancers, only 1 was assigned to Lung-RADS 3 using a 20mm threshold. This increased to 4 and 12 for thresholds of 15 and 10mm, respectively. Conclusion: Using a threshold of 20mm to select pure GGNs that warrant shorter follow-up will miss almost all cancers. A less conservative threshold of 10mm - as has been suggested by the Fleischner Society - will select three-quarters of the cancers at the expense of an overall increased number of followup CTs.},

  title = {Can morphological features differentiate between malignant and benign pulmonary nodules, detected in a screen setting?},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {PURPOSE Existing nodule classification systems and risk models (e.g., McWilliams model, LungRADS) consider only nodule type, size, growth, and the presence of a spiculated border. However, radiologists consider additional morphological features when assigning a malignancy risk. Goal of the study was to determine the power of additional morphological features to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules. METHOD AND MATERIALS All 60 cancers were selected from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial, in thefirst scan where they were visible, and a benign set of 120 randomly selected and 120 sizematched benign nodules from baseline scans were included, all from different participants. Data had been acquired using a lowdose (16x0.75mm, 120 kVp, 40 mAs) protocol, and 1mm section thickness reconstruction. Seven radiologists were asked to score the presence of morphological features for each nodule referring to density distribution (homogeneous, inhomogeneous, high, low), lesion margin (spiculation, lobulation, demarcation by interlobular septa, sharplydefined, illdefined), lesion surrounding (distortion of the surrounding parenchyma, pleural/fissure retraction, attachment to pleura, fissure or vessel) and lesion architecture (thickened wall of a bulla, bubbles, air bronchogram). Separately per observer and feature, chi square analysis was used to determine the power to discriminate between benign and malignant nodules. Features with a pvalue <0.05 in AC/aEURdegAY=4 observers are reported. RESULTS Significant differences were seen for inhomogeneous density distribution (p <0.001 0.003) and pleural/fissure retraction (p < 0.001 0.047) in 7 observers. The presence of bubbles (p <0.001 0.025), spiculation (p <0.001), lobulation (p <0.001), and an illdefined nodule border (p<0.0010.012) were significant in 6 observers. The presence of a thickened bulla wall in 5 observers (p<0.0010.042), and air bronchogram (p<0.0010.006) and distortion of surrounding architecture (p<0.0010.004) was significantly different in 4 observers. CONCLUSION We have identified several morphological features that are significantly associated with malignancy of pulmonary nodules, but not included in current risk prediction models. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Morphological features can be used to differentiate malignant from benign nodules. Further studies will show whether integration of more morphological features will increase the power of risk prediction.},

  year = {2015},
  abstract = {PURPOSE In 2014 LungRADS was published to standardize CT lung screening reporting and management, based on nodule type, size, and growth. In 2013 the McWilliams model was published providing a nodule malignancy probability based on nodule size, type, morphology and subject characteristics. Threshold of the McWilliams score provides an alternative over LungRADS categories to determine workup for screendetected nodules. We compare both approaches on an independent data set. METHOD AND MATERIALS All 60 cancers were selected from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial, in the first scan where they were visible, and 120 randomly selected benign nodules from baseline scans were added, all from different participants. Data had been acquired using a lowdose (16x0.75mm, 120kVp, 40mAs) protocol, and 1mm section thickness reconstruction. For each nodule, the malignancy probability was calculated using McWilliams model 2b. Parameters were available from the screening database or scored by an expert radiologist. Completely calcified nodules and perifissural nodules were given a score of 0, in accordance with the McWilliams model. All nodules were categorized into their LungRADS category based on nodule type and diameter. Perifissural nodules were treated as regular solid nodules, inaccordance with LungRADS guidelines. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated, for each LungRADS category cutoff. For each specificity level, corresponding sensitivity of the McWilliams model was determined. RESULTS McWilliams performed substantially better than LungRADS in selecting malignant nodules for more aggressive followup. Defining LungRADS category 2/3/4A/4B and up as a positive screening result, nodule malignancy specificity was 21%/65%/86%/99% and sensitivity was 100%/85%/58%/32%. At the same specificities, McWilliamsAC/a,!a,,C/s sensitivity was higher with 100%/96%/86%/45%. CONCLUSION For every cutoff level in LungRADS, the McWilliams model operating at the same specificity has superior sensitivity to differentiate malignant from benign nodules. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION The McWilliams model seems to be a better tool than LungRADS to provide a malignancy risk and help radiologists determine which subgroup of nodules detected in a screening setting need more invasive workup.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Lung-RADS published in 2014 by the American College of Radiology is based on results of the literature and expert opinion and uses nodule type, size, and growth to recommend nodule management adjusted to malignancy risk. The McWilliams model published in 2013 is based on baseline screen detected nodules from the Canadian screening trial and provides a nodule malignancy probability based on nodule size, type, morphology and subject characteristics. We compare the performance of both approaches on an independent data set. METHODS: We selected 60 cancers from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial as presented in the first scan they were visible, and randomly added 120 benign nodules from baseline scans, all from different participants. Data had been acquired using a low-dose (16x0.75mm, 120kVp, 40mAs) protocol, and 1mm section thickness reconstruction. For each nodule, the malignancy probability was calculated using McWilliams model 2b. Parameters were available from the screening database or scored by an expert radiologist. For the McWilliams model completely calcified nodules and perifissural nodules were assigned a malignancy probability of 0, in accordance with the McWilliams model. All nodules were categorized into their Lung-RADS category based on nodule type and diameter. Perifissural nodules were treated as solid nodules, in accordance with Lung-RADS guidelines. For each Lung-RADS category cut-off sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Corresponding sensitivities and specificities using the McWilliams model were determined. RESULTS: McWilliams performed superiorly to Lung-RADS in selecting malignant nodules for more aggressive follow-up. Defining Lung-RADS category 2/3/4A/4B and higher as a positive screening result, specificities to exclude lung malignancy were 21%/65%/86%/99% and vice versa sensitivities to predict malignancy were 100%/85%/58%/32%. At the same sensitivity levels, McWilliams model yielded overall higher specificities with 2%/86%/98%/100%, respectively. Similarly, at the same specificities McWilliamsAC/a,!a,,C/s model achieved higher sensitivities with 100%/95%/85%/48%, respectively. CONCLUSION: For every cut-off level of Lung-RADS, the McWilliams model yields superior specificity to reduce unnecessary work-up for benign nodules, and higher sensitivity to predict malignancy. The McWilliams model seems to be a better tool than Lung-RADS to provide a malignancy risk, thus reducing unnecessary work-up and helping radiologists determine which subgroup of nodules detected in a screening setting need more invasive work-up.},

From the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial database, 64 CTs with malignant nodules and 549 baseline CTs with benign nodules were included. Performance of the systems was evaluated applying the system's original diameter definitions: D(longest-C) (PanCan), D(meanAxial) (NCCN), both obtained from axial sections, and D(mean3D) (Lung-RADS). Subsequently all diameter definitions were applied uniformly to all systems. Areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were used to evaluate risk discrimination. PanCan performed superiorly to Lung-RADS and NCCN (AUC 0.874 vs. 0.813, p?=?0.003; 0.874 vs. 0.836, p?=?0.010), using the original diameter specifications. When uniformly applying D(longest-C), D(mean3D) and D(meanAxial), PanCan remained superior to Lung-RADS (p?<?0.001 - p?=?0.001) and NCCN (p?<?0.001 - p?=?0.016).

Without follow-up information, the PanCan model performs significantly superiorly to Lung-RADS and the 1.2016 NCCN guidelines for discriminating benign from malignant nodules. The NCCN guidelines are most sensitive to nodule size definition. - PanCan model outperforms Lung-RADS and 1.2016 NCCN guidelines in identifying malignant pulmonary nodules. - Nodule size definition had no significant impact on Lung-RADS and PanCan model. - 1.2016 NCCN guidelines were significantly superior when using mean diameter to longest diameter. - Longest diameter achieved lowest performance for all models. - Mean diameter performed equivalently when derived from axial sections and from volumetry.},

  abstract = {To compare human observers to a mathematically derived computer model for differentiation between malignant and benign pulmonary nodules detected on baseline screening computed tomography (CT) scans. A case-cohort study design was chosen. The study group consisted of 300 chest CT scans from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST). It included all scans with proven malignancies (n = 62) and two subsets of randomly selected baseline scans with benign nodules of all sizes (n = 120) and matched in size to the cancers, respectively (n = 118). Eleven observers and the computer model (PanCan) assigned a malignancy probability score to each nodule. Performances were expressed by area under the ROC curve (AUC). Performance differences were tested using the Dorfman, Berbaum and Metz method. Seven observers assessed morphological nodule characteristics using a predefined list. Differences in morphological features between malignant and size-matched benign nodules were analyzed using chi-square analysis with Bonferroni correction. A significant difference was defined at p < 0.004. Performances of the model and observers were equivalent (AUC 0.932 versus 0.910, p = 0.184) for risk-assessment of malignant and benign nodules of all sizes. However, human readers performed superior to the computer model for differentiating malignant nodules from size-matched benign nodules (AUC 0.819 versus 0.706, p < 0.001). Large variations between observers were seen for ROC areas and ranges of risk scores. Morphological findings indicative of malignancy referred to border characteristics (spiculation, p < 0.001) and perinodular architectural deformation (distortion of surrounding lung parenchyma architecture, p < 0.001; pleural retraction, p = 0.002). Computer model and human observers perform equivalent for differentiating malignant from randomly selected benign nodules, confirming the high potential of computer models for nodule risk estimation in population based screening studies. However, computer models highly rely on size as discriminator. Incorporation of other morphological criteria used by human observers to superiorly discriminate size-matched malignant from benign nodules, will further improve computer performance.},

  abstract = {Lung-RADS represents a categorical system published by the American College of Radiology to standardise management in lung cancer screening. The purpose of the study was to quantify how well readers agree in assigning Lung-RADS categories to screening CTs; secondary goals were to assess causes of disagreement and evaluate its impact on patient management. For the observer study, 80 baseline and 80 follow-up scans were randomly selected from the NLST trial covering all Lung-RADS categories in an equal distribution. Agreement of seven observers was analysed using Cohen's kappa statistics. Discrepancies were correlated with patient management, test performance and diagnosis of malignancy within the scan year. Pairwise interobserver agreement was substantial (mean kappa 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.77). Lung-RADS category disagreement was seen in approximately one-third (29%, 971) of 3360 reading pairs, resulting in different patient management in 8% (278/3360). Out of the 91 reading pairs that referred to scans with a tumour diagnosis within 1 year, discrepancies in only two would have resulted in a substantial management change. Assignment of lung cancer screening CT scans to Lung-RADS categories achieves substantial interobserver agreement. Impact of disagreement on categorisation of malignant nodules was low. * Lung-RADS categorisation of low-dose lung screening CTs achieved substantial interobserver agreement. * Major cause for disagreement was assigning a different nodule as risk-dominant. * Disagreement led to a different follow-up time in 8% of reading pairs.},

  year = {2020},
  abstract = {Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide in both men and women. Since patients only develop clinical symptoms in an advanced stage of the disease, most lung cancers are diagnosed in a late stage which has a vastly lower survival rate than early stage disease. Lung cancer screening through CT scans can help to detect early stage lung cancer, which manifests itself as a pulmonary nodule, a round focal opacity in the lungs. Radiologists need to differentiate malignant from benign nodules on these CT scans to recommend the most appropriate follow-up procedure. In order to aid radiologists and to standardize the interpretation, several categorical systems and computer models have been developed for the risk assessment of pulmonary nodules. This thesis presents the evaluation of the performance of human observers and computer models to characterize pulmonary nodules mainly with respect to differentiating malignant from benign nodules.},

Prostate MRI was recently established as a good modality for diagnosing clinically significant cancer (csPCa). Automatic segmentation of the prostate is an important part of current research in computer aided diagnosis (CAD) and optimized acquisition of MRI. State-of-the art segmentation uses standard convolution neural networks (CNN) using only axial t2-weighted MRI. The anisotropy caused by the much lower inter-plane MRI resolution results in segmentation errors in the apex and base region. Meyer et al. recently showed that adding the sagittal and coronal t2-weighted series to a conventional isotropic CNN improves segmentation performance. We propose an MRI specific CNN that is designed to handle anisotropic, multi-planar acquisitions and reduce annotation and computational effort by extending our previously developed anisotropic single plane CNN},

Concentric patches at multiple resolutions with different fields of view, feed different branches of HookNet, and intermediate representations are combined via a hooking mechanism. We describe a framework to design and train HookNet for achieving high-resolution semantic segmentation and introduce constraints to guarantee pixel-wise alignment in feature maps during hooking. We show the advantages of using HookNet in two histopathology image segmentation tasks where tissue type prediction accuracy strongly depends on contextual information, namely (1) multi-class tissue segmentation in breast cancer and, (2) segmentation of tertiary lymphoid structures and germinal centers in lung cancer. We show the superiority of HookNet when compared with single-resolution U-Net models working at different resolutions as well as with a recently published multi-resolution model for histopathology image segmentation.

Second, 18 participants clustered the images using a newly developed card sorting program. The mutual agreement between the participants was 57% and 56% and between the algorithm and the participants it was 47% and 45%, for respectively color and gray-scale texture images. Third, in a benchmark, 30 participants judged the algorithmsA-A?A 1/2  clusters with gray-scale textures as more homogeneous then those with colored textures. However, a high interpersonal variability was present for both the color and the gray-scale clusters. So, despite the promising results, it is questionable whether average human texture classification can be mimicked (if it exists at all).},

  year = {2006},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: The lung lobes are subdivided into pulmonary segments. There are 10 segments in the right lung and 9 in the left lung. An algorithm is presented for automatic identification of pulmonary segments from computed tomography scans. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Data was taken from the Nelson study, a lung cancer screening program with low dose CT (Philips Mx8000IDT, 16 x 0.75 mm collimation, 30 mAs). In this study, all abnormal findings are annotated by expert radiologists and for each finding the pulmonary segment in which it resides is recorded. From all scans with more than 5 findings, 200 scans were randomly selected. From these, 190 scans with 1690 findings were used for training the system; the remaining 10 scans with 196 findings were used for evaluation. In these evaluation scans, a second expert recorded the pulmonary segments for all findings. Two automatic algorithms were developed to find, respectively, the lungs and the major and minor pulmonary fissures within the lungs. From these segmentations, a number of features can be assigned to each lung voxel based on its relative position in the lung, and its distance from and position relative to the fissures. Using the known segment labels for all findings in the training data, a k-nearest neighbor classifier is trained that can assign each lung voxel in an unseen scan to a pulmonary segment. RESULTS: The second expert agreed with the original recordings in 134 of the 196 findings (68%). The accuracy of the automatic system in assigning pulmonary segment labels evaluated on all 196 findings was 77%. This increased to 85% using the set of 134 finding for which there was consensus among experts. When the system made an error, a location was always assigned to a neighboring segment. CONCLUSION: A position in the lungs can be automatically assigned to a pulmonary segment with an accuracy comparable to that of human observers. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: Automatic segmentation of pulmonary segments is an important feature for clinical workstations for lung analysis and for a range of applications in computer aided diagnosis},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Standard algorithms for segmenting the lungs on CT chest scans fail when large or subpleural abnormalities are present. A new hybrid lung segmentation method is presented that automatically detects failures of a standard algorithm and resorts to an advanced atlas-based algorithm when needed. METHOD AND MATERIALS Volumetric CT scans (Philips Mx8000IDT, 16 x 0.75 mm collimation) were used: 1360 scans taken from the NELSON lung cancer screening program (30 mAs) and 250 clinical scans (50-120 mAs) from a database of patients with interstitial lung disease. The lungs in all scans were automatically segmented with a fast algorithm based on region growing and morphological processing. Next, segmentation failure was automatically detected based on statistical deviation from a range of volume and shape measurements. To scans with failures an advanced multi-atlas based algorithm using non-rigid registration was applied. Results were visually inspected. RESULTS The standard method required on average 55 seconds per scan. Error detection took 4 seconds per scan and the atlas-based method took on average 80 minutes, all on a single high-end PC. Among the lung cancer screening scans all 7 errors were automatically detected (0.5%). Error detection was correct in all cases. Errors were caused by pathologic abnormalities, the atlas-based method correctly segmented these scans. Total average segmentation time was 79 seconds. In the scans with interstitial lung disease 84 failures (34%) were automatically detected, segmentation was correct in other cases. 3 scans were erroneously labelled as failure, in all other cases failures were caused by pathologic changes. The atlas-based method correctly segmented 70 (83%) of those 84 cases. Total average segmentation time was 27 minutes. CONCLUSION Hybrid lung segmentation that relies on standard image processing techniques and resorts to atlas-based segmentation when failures are detected is generally fast and produces accurate results even in scans with severe pathologic abnormalities. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Automatic lung segmentation is a prerequisite for computerized analysis of chest CT. A new method that combines a faster and a sophisticated method to be robust against pathologies is presented.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE To investigate the lobar and segmental variation in distribution of emphysema detected on volumetric high-resolution CT in a group of chronic smokers. METHOD AND MATERIALS A set of 350 volumetric CT scans was randomly selected from the NELSON study, a lung cancer screening program with low-dose CT (16x 0.75 mm collimation, 30 mAs). The pulmonary segments were segmented with an automatic algorithm based on automatic lung and fissure segmentations and a k-nearest neighbor classification. For each segment an emphysema score was computed as the percentage of attenuation values below a fixed threshold. Two thresholds T were applied: T = -910 HU and -950 HU. In addition, lobar and total emphysema scores were calculated. To assess whether distribution changed with larger amount of emphysema, we performed a separate analysis of patients in whom the total emphysema score was above 2% for A-A?A 1/2 950 HU (153 scans) and above 10% for A-A?A 1/2 910 HU (272 scans). Differences were evaluated using paired t-tests. RESULTS The upper and middle lobe/ lingula of either lung showed significantly higher emphysema scores than the lower lobe (p<0.05), independent of threshold or extent of emphysema. No significant difference was found for scores in the upper lobes, middle lobe or lingula. Segment R2 and segments 6, 9, and 10 in both lungs were significantly less affected than the other segments, independent of threshold or extent of emphysema (p<0.05). For T = -950 the mean emphysema score for segments 6, 9, 10 and R2 was below 2.9% (1.7% to 2.8%), while the mean score for all other segments was above 3.1% (3.2% to 5.2%). In the subgroup with total scores > 2% these limits were 5.6% and 6.2%, respectively. For T = -910 the mean emphysema score for segments R2, 6, 9 and 10 was below 16.3% (11.2% to 16.2% ), while the mean score for all other segments was above 18.4% (18.5% to 30.3%). In the subgroup with total scores > 10% these limits were 20.0% and 22.1%. CONCLUSION There is not only lobar variability in distribution of emphysema in chronic smokers but also segmental with segment R2, and segments 6, 9 and 10 of both lungs being least affected. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION The results provide new insights about the distribution of smoking-related emphysema.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE To investigate the variation in incomplete pulmonary fissures on volumetric high-resolution CT scans using a completely automatic method. METHOD AND MATERIALS A set of 1000 volumetric CT scans was randomly selected from the NELSON study, a lung cancer screening trial with low-dose CT (16x 0.75 mm collimation, 30 mAs). The lungs were automatically segmented and the pulmonary fissures were enhanced using a k-nearest neighbor classifier employing Hessian eigenvalues and gray value information. Based on the lung and fissure information, a linear discriminant classifier was trained to assign each voxel to a pulmonary lobe based on its relative position in the lung and its distance from and position relative to the fissures. To determine the completeness of the pulmonary fissures, each point on the enhanced fissures that was above a certain threshold was assigned to the closest point on the lobe border. Voxels on the lobe border not assigned to a fissure voxel were considered to be non-fissure and therefore incomplete. The percentage of incomplete border voxels quantifies the incompleteness of the fissures. Results were calculated for the major fissure in the left lung and the major and minor fissures in the right lung. Based on experimentation four categories were defined for quantification: (almost) complete (0-20% missing), slightly incomplete (20-35%), incomplete (35-90%) and absent (90%-100%). The method was validated by manual assessments of fissural completeness in a subset of 50 cases. RESULTS Visual and automatic categorization of fissural completeness were consistent in 87% of cases for the left and right major fissures and in 82% of cases for the right minor fissure. The left major fissure was complete in 53% of subjects, 23% was slightly incomplete, 23% was incomplete and in 1% was absent. For the right major fissure those numbers were 42%, 34%, 24% and 0% respectively. The right minor fissure was most often incomplete; 8%, 12%, 66% and 14% for the respective categories. CONCLUSION A quantitative measure for fissural completeness can be determined fully automatically. There is substantial variation in fissural completeness with fissures often being incomplete. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Fissural completeness may be an indicator of collateral ventilation and have significance in endobronchial valve treatment planning for emphysema patients.},

  abstract = {{I}n this thesis, methods are described for the automatic segmentation of anatomical structures from chest {CT} scans. {F}irst, a method to segment the lungs from chest {CT} scans is presented. {S}tandard lung segmentation algorithms rely on large attenuation differences between the lungs and the surrounding tissue. {T}hose methods are fast and perform well in a large percentage of cases. {H}owever, when abnormalities are present, such algorithms often fail. {T}he few methods that have been proposed to handle such cases are too time consuming to be applied in clinical practice. {W}e propose a method that combines two existing methods using automatic error detection. {T}his method is shown to perform substantially better than a standard algorithm at a relatively low increase in computational cost. {A}fter the lungs are segmented, the fissures inside the lungs are extracted. {T}he goal of the fissure extraction is to detect both the lobar and the accessory fissures. {T}o this end, a supervised filter based on pattern recognition techniques is designed. {I}t is shown that the filter is able to detect fissures with a high accuracy. {I}n a next chapter, the lungs and fissures are used to identify lobes and segments in the lungs. {F}irst, the lobes are extracted using a supervised method that employs the lobar fissures and the lungs. {S}ince there are no physical boundaries between the segments, a method is designed that assigns to each voxel a probability that it belongs to a segment based on the position in the lobe and the position relative to the closest fissure. {I}t is shown that the method is able to assign a set of points in each scan to the correct segment with an accuracy comparable to the inter- and intra-observer agreement. {I}n the next chapter, a method to extract the airways from chest {CT} scans is presented. {F}rom an automatically determined seed point in the trachea, a tree structure is grown based on a set of rules. {A}long with a segmentation of the bronchial tree, a method to extract the anatomical labels for airway branches up to segmental level is presented. {T}he method is shown to perform well in different types of {CT} scans. {T}he next chapter is a methodological chapter that describes two new frameworks for multi-atlas segmentation. {T}he frameworks improve upon standard multi-atlas segmentation by including an automatic atlas selection, a stopping criterion that determines when no more improvement is expected, and a method to determine which area of a scan would benefit from additional atlases. {T}he method is applied to segmentation of the heart in chest {CT} scans and, to show the general applicability, segmentation of the caudate nucleus in brain {MR} scans. {I}n the final chapter, a method to segment the lobes is presented that combines the segmentation results and methodology described in previous chapters to enhance performance. {T}he method incorporates contextual information using automatic lung, fissure, and bronchial tree segmentations. {S}hape information is incorporated using a multi-atlas approach. {T}he method is shown to perform well in data with incomplete lobar fissures.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and validate a robust technique for automatic extraction of the pulmonary lobes from thoracic CT scans that is not sensitive to the presence of incomplete fissures. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Volumetric CT scans (Philips Mx8000IDT, 16 x 0.75 mm collimation) were used: 100 scans selected from a lung cancer screening program (30 mAs) that showed substantially incomplete fissures, and 20 scans (100-150 mAs) randomly selected from clinical practice. We propose a multi-atlas approach in which existing lobar segmentations in scans with complete fissures are deformed to unseen test scans in which the fissures, the lungs, and the bronchial tree have been automatically segmented. The key element is a cost function that exploits information from fissures, lung borders, and bronchial tree, in such a way that less reliable information (lungs, airways) is only used when the most reliable information (fissures) is missing. To cope with anatomical variation in lobar shapes, the atlas that is anatomically most similar to the test scan is automatically selected. For quantitative evaluation, the right and left major fissure and the right minor fissure in the 20 clinical scans were automatically segmented. For the 100 scans with incomplete fissures, a human observer indicated whether the lobe segmentation was (1) completely correct, (2) incorrect within 12 mm of the true lobe border, or (3) incorrect further than 12 mm from the true lobe border. RESULTS: The average distance of the manually segmented lobe borders to the automatic lobe borders was 0.48 mm for the left major fissure, 1.23 mm for the right major fissure, and 1.28 mm for the right minor fissure. The observer scored for the left major fissure 79 lobe border as correct and the other 21 to be within 12 mm. For the right major fissure those numbers were 89 and 11, and for the right minor fissure 76 and 24, respectively. CONCLUSION: Automatic segmentation of pulmonary lobes in cases with substantially incomplete pulmonary fissures is feasible with a high accuracy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: Automatic segmentation of the pulmonary lobes is essential for quantitative analysis of chest CT scans.},

  abstract = {To gain insight into the underlying pathways of emphysema and monitor the effect of treatment, methods to quantify and phenotype the different types of emphysema from chest {CT} scans are of crucial importance. Current standard measures rely on density thresholds for individual voxels, which is influenced by inspiration level and does not take into account the spatial relationship between voxels. Measures based on texture analysis do take the interrelation between voxels into account and therefore might be useful for distinguishing different types of emphysema. In this study, we propose to use {M}inkowski functionals combined with rotation invariant {G}aussian features to distinguish between healthy and emphysematous tissue and classify three different types of emphysema. {M}inkowski functionals characterize binary images in terms of geometry and topology. In 3{D}, four {M}inkowski functionals are defined. By varying the threshold and size of neighborhood around a voxel, a set of {M}inkowski functionals can be defined for each voxel. Ten chest {CT} scans with 1810 annotated regions were used to train the method. A set of 108 features was calculated for each training sample from which 10 features were selected to be most informative. A linear discriminant classifier was trained to classify each voxel in the lungs into a subtype of emphysema or normal lung. The method was applied to an independent test set of 30 chest {CT} scans with varying amounts and types of emphysema with 4347 annotated regions of interest. The method is shown to perform well, with an overall accuracy of 95%.},

  booktitle = ATS,
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {{RATIONALE:} {T}o gain insight into the underlying pathways of emphysema and monitor the effect of treatment, methods to quantify emphysema from low dose chest computed tomography ({CT}) scans are of crucial importance. Currently, emphysema is often quantified in {CT} scans by densitometric measures (e.g. relative area under -950 {HU} ({RA}950)), which are known to be affected by inspiration level of the patient and scanner parameters. Especially in low-dose {CT} scans, image noise can lead to an increase in {RA}950. The purpose of this study is to compare a method for quantifying emphysema from low dose chest {CT} scans using texture analysis based on integral geometry descriptors to {RA}950. {METHODS:} {S}tandardized pre-treatment {CT} scans from 13 subjects enrolled in clinical trials for emphysema treatment were taken from an anonymized research database. {CT} imaging of the thorax was performed at suspended full inspiration with at most 1.25 mm slice thickness, 0.6 mm slice spacing at 120 {KV} and 25-40 m{A}s. An automatic method to classify each voxel into emphysema ({E}) or non-emphysema ({NE}) was developed based on {M}inkowski {F}unctionals and rotationally invariant Gaussian features. A combination of nine features was used to train a k-nearest neighbor classifier which assigns to each voxel in a test scan a label {E} or {NE}. To evaluate the automatic method, 18 regions of interest ({ROI}) were randomly placed in the lungs in each scan, equally divided over 6 different zones in the lungs. An observer study was performed in which expert chest radiologists annotated each {ROI} as being either {NE} or {E}. The texture analysis method was applied to the {ROI}s in a leave-one-patient-out fashion. An emphysema score ({ES}) was defined as the percentage of voxels in the {ROI} classified as emphysematous. {RA}950 was also calculated for each {ROI}. For both methods, an {ES} > 5% was defined to be emphysematous. The output of the texture analysis method and {RA}950 were compared to the visual assessment using confusion matrices. {RESULTS:} The confusion matrix comparing the proposed method and {RA}950 to the visual annotation is shown in {T}able 1. The standard {RA}950 measure has an accuracy for classifying emphysema vs. non-emphysema of 67%, the proposed method has an accuracy of 89%. {F}igure 1 illustrates the effect of image noise on both methods. {CONCLUSION:} The proposed method is able to quantify emphysema with a better accuracy than the standard {RA}950 method in low dose chest {CT} scans.},

  booktitle = ATS,
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {{RATIONALE:} {P}ulmonary fissures are important anatomical landmarks in recognizing pulmonary lobar structure and the regional assessment of the extent and distribution of lung disease. Incomplete fissures contribute to collateral ventilation across lobes and detection and quantification of incomplete lobar fissures may have clinical implications for the outcome of resections and bronchoscopic lung volume reduction ({BLVR}) planning for emphysema patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a technique for automatic quantification of fissural completeness from chest computed tomography scans on a database of subjects with severe emphysema. {METHODS:} {F}rom an imaging research database, 96 patients with severe emphysema enrolled in clinical trials for {BLVR} treatment were identified. Standardized pre-treatment volumetric {CT} imaging of the thorax was performed at suspended full inspiration with at most 1 mm slice thickness at 120 {KV} and 80-110 m{A}s. Fissural completeness for the left major and right major and minor fissures was assessed by visual read and automatic quantification. Visual assessment of fissural completeness was performed by two expert radiologists inspecting all three planes. For visual scoring a dichotomous scale was used to score fissure integrity: complete or partial. A complete fissure was defined as more than 90% intact surface of the fissure and no obvious vessels crossing over. For automatic quantification, the lungs, fissures, and lobes were automatically segmented and the percentage integrity of the fissures was calculated as the percentage of the lobar border defined by a fissure. The continuous integrity score of the automatic method is compared to the dichotomous visual assessments of both readers using {ROC} analysis, boxplots, and rank sum tests. {RESULTS:} {F}or all three pulmonary fissures, compared to both readers, boxplot analysis showed that the automatic method gave significantly higher completeness scores (means 91.04%, 93.16%, 93.65% and 90.06%, 88.08%, 93.77%, for the right major, right minor, and left major fissures, for both readers, respectively) for fissures assessed by the readers as complete than for those assessed as partial (means 83.17%, 69.49%, 86.18%, and 82.97%, 70.09%, 85.16% ) (p<0.001). The kappa statistics for the radiologists? agreement were 0.75, 0.59, and 0.74, respectively. The {ROC} curves for the automatic method compared to each reader for each fissure are provided in {F}igure 2. {CONCLUSION:} {A} completely automatic method for quantification of fissural completeness is able to quantify fissural completeness in a cohort of subjects with severe emphysema comparable to expert radiologists.},

  pages = {261--268},
  abstract = {Lung and lobe segmentation are prerequisites for automated analysis of chest {CT} scans. This paper presents fully automatic methods for segmentation of the lungs and lobes from thorax {CT} scans. Both methods have previously been published. The lung segmentation starts by automatically identifying the trachea and main bronchi. From the trachea, the lungs are found using a region growing approach. In cases for which errors are automatically detected in the resulting lung segmentation, a multi-atlas segmentation approach is applied. The lobe segmentation is based on a multi-atlas approach and was especially designed to be robust against incomplete ssures. The methods were evaluated on 55 volumetric chest {CT} scans provided by the {LO}be and {L}ung {A}nalysis 2011 {(LOLA11)} challenge. The scans were acquired at different sites, using several different scanners, scanning protocols, and reconstruction parameters.},

  abstract = {{C}hronic {O}bstructive {P}ulmonary {D}isease ({COPD}) is a chronic lung disease that is characterized by airflow limitation. {COPD} is clinically diagnosed and monitored using pulmonary function testing ({PFT}), which measures global inspiration and expiration capabilities of patients and is time-consuming and labor-intensive. It is becoming standard practice to obtain paired inspiration-expiration {CT} scans of {COPD} patients. Predicting the {PFT} results from the {CT} scans would alleviate the need for {PFT} testing. It is hypothesized that the change of the trachea during breathing might be an indicator of tracheomalacia in {COPD} patients and correlate with {COPD} severity. In this paper, we propose to automatically measure morphological changes in the trachea from paired inspiration and expiration {CT} scans and investigate the in fluence on {COPD} {GOLD} stage classification. The trachea is automatically segmented and the trachea shape is encoded using the lengths of rays cast from the center of gravity of the trachea. These features are used in a classi er, combined with emphsyma scoring, to attempt to classify subjects into their {COPD} stage. A database of 187 subjects, well distributed over the {COPD} {GOLD} stages 0 through 4 was used for this study. The data was randomly divided into training and test set. Using the training scans, a nearest mean classifier was trained to classify the subjects into their correct {GOLD} stage using either emphysema score, tracheal shape features, or a combination. Combining the proposed trachea shape features with emphysema score, the classi cation performance into {GOLD} stages improved with 11% to 51%. In addition, an 80% accuracy was achieved in distinguishing healthy subjects from {COPD} patients.},

  title = {Dynamic Hyperinflation in {COPD} Patients: Is It Related to Emphysema and Airway Morphology in Inspiration and Expiration Thoracic {CT}?},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {{PURPOSE} Dynamic hyperinflation ({DH}), progressive airtrapping during exercise, is related to dyspnea in {COPD} patients. A subgroup of {COPD} patients divided over all {GOLD} stages suffer from dynamic hyperinflation. This study relates automatically extracted measures of airway morphology, airtrapping and emphysema to dynamic hyperinflation. {METHOD AND MATERIALS} As part of a research study, eighteen {COPD} patients underwent low dose {CT} (64x0.75mm, Siemens Sensation 64) at full inspiration and expiration. Using a portable ergo-spirometry system ({O}xycon {M}obile) to measure operational lung volume during activities of daily life, the study population was divided into ten patients suffering from {DH} and eight non-{DH}. Research software ({D}iagnostic {I}mage {A}nalysis {G}roup, {N}ijmegen, The {N}etherlands; {F}raunhofer {MEVIS}, {B}remen, {G}ermany) automatically segmented the lungs and airways in both the inspiration and expiration scans. As measures for emphysema, the percentages of lung volume below -950 {HU} ({IN}-950) and the 15th percentile of the cumulative histogram ({PD}15) were computed in inspiration scans. As a quantification of air-trapping, the percentages of lung volume below -856 {HU} were computed in expiration scans ({EX}-856). Airway morphology was extracted from the inspiration scans as the wall area percentage at airways with a circumference of 10mm ({Pi10}), computed using regression on all cross-sectional airway measurements. Means and standard deviations for each measurement are reported for the two groups. {RESULTS} The means and standard deviations of the measurements for the {DH} and non-{DH} groups were 19.7 A-A?A 1/2  8.6% and 14.6 A-A?A 1/2  10.5% for IN-950, -956 A-A?A 1/2  15 {HU} and -945 A-A?A 1/2  23 {HU} for {PD}15, 47.2 A-A?A 1/2  13.7% and 35.1 A-A?A 1/2  10.9% for {EX}-856, and 48.0 A-A?A 1/2  6.9% and 40.7 A-A?A 1/2  9.3% for {Pi10}, respectively. The differences between the {DH} and non-{DH} group are thus more pronounced for {EX}-856 and {Pi10} than for {IN}-950 and {PD}15. {CONCLUSION} Quantitative measurements from inspiration and expiration {CT} scans related to airway morphology appear to be more informative for distinguishing {COPD} patients suffering from dynamic hyperinflation from non-hyperinflators than emphysema related measurements. {CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION} Understanding the underlying pathways of hyperinflation is important for the management of {COPD} since reduction of dynamic hyperinflation is strongly correlated with less dyspnea complaints.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recommendation by the US Preventive Services Task Force to screen high-risk smokers with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and the recent decision by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to fund LDCT screening under the Medicare program mean that LDCT screening will be implemented at the population level in the US and likely in other countries. With the large volume of scans that will be generated, accurate and efficient interpretation of LDCT images is key to providing a cost-effective implementation of LDCT screening to the large at risk population. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an alternative workflow to identify and triage abnormal LDCT scans in which a technician assisted by Computer Vision (CV) software acts as first reader with the aim to reduce workload, improve speed, consistency and quality of interpretation of screening LDCT scans. METHODS: A test dataset of baseline Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study LDCT scans (New Engl J Med. 2013;369:908-17) was used. This included: 136 scans with lung cancers, 556 scans with benign nodules and 136 scans without nodules. The scans were randomly assigned for analysis by the CV software (CIRRUS Lung Screening, Diagnostic Imaging Analysis Group, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). The annotated scans were then reviewed by a technician without knowledge of the diagnosis. The scans were classified by the technician as either normal (no nodules or benign nodules only, potentially not requiring radiologist review) or abnormal (suspicious of malignancy or other abnormality requiring radiologist review). The results were compared with the Pan-Can Study radiologists. Nodules found by CIRRUS but not by the radiologist were reviewed by a subspecialty trained chest radiologist with 14 years experience in lung cancer screening (JM). RESULTS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of the technician to identify an abnormal scan were: 97.7% (95% CI: 96.3 - 98.7) and 98.0% (95% CI: 89.5 - 99.7) respectively. The technician correctly identified all the scans with malignant nodules. The time taken by the technician to read a scan was 208A,A+-120 sec. CONCLUSIONS: A technician assisted by CV software can categorize accurately abnormal scans for review by a radiologist. Pre-screening by a technician and CV software is a promising strategy for reducing workload, improving the speed, consistency and quality of scan interpretation of screening chest CTs.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously reported a practical predictive tool that accurately estimates the probability of malignancy for lung nodules detected at baseline screening LDCT (New Engl J Med. 2013;369:908-17). Manual measurement of nodule dimensions and generation of malignancy risk scores is time consuming and subjected to intra- and inter-observer variability. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to prepare a nodule malignancy risk prediction model based on automated computer generated nodule data and compare it to an established model based on radiologistsAC/a,!a,,C/ generated data. METHODS: Using the same published PanCan dataset (New Engl J Med. 2013;369:908-17) with the number of lung cancers updated, we prepared a logistic regression model predicting lung cancer using computer-generated imaging data from the CIRRUS Lung Screening software (Diagnostic Imaging Analysis Group, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Ninety-one of the 2,537 baseline (first) scans were not available or could not be processed by CIRRUS. The remaining 2,446 scans were first annotated by the CIRRUS software. A human non-radiologist reader then accepted/rejected the annotated marks and manually searched the LDCT for nodules missed by CIRRUS or the study radiologist. New nodules found that were not recorded by the study radiologist were reviewed by a subspecialty trained chest radiologist with 14 years experience in lung cancer screening (JM). Nodule morphometric measurements (maximum and mean diameter, volume, mass, density) and total nodule count per scan irrespective of size were automatically generated by the CIRRUS software. The nodule type (nonsolid, part-solid, or solid), nodule description (lobulated, spiculated or well defined) and nodule location (upper versus middle or lower lobe) were manually entered. The variables were evaluated in models as untransformed and natural log transformed variables. Nonlinear relationships with lung cancer were also evaluated. Socio-demographic and clinical history predictors were not included in the model. RESULTS: Radiologists evaluation identified 8,570 pulmonary nodules of any size in 2063 individuals - 124 nodules in 119 individuals were diagnosed as cancer in follow-up. Based on CIRRUS software annotated marks that were accepted by a human reader, computer analysis identified 11,520 pulmonary nodules in 2174 individuals - 121 nodules in 115 individuals were diagnosed as cancer in follow-up. Thirty-six percent of the new nodules found by CIRRUS and/or second human reader were AC/aEURdegAY=4 mm (meanA,A+-SD, 5.9A,A+- 3.5 mm). Both the computer generated imaging data model (Model-CIRRUS) and the radiologist generated data model (Model-RAD) demonstrated excellent discrimination and calibration. Their predictive performances were also similar. Comparing Model-CAD to Model-RAD, the AUCs were 0.9537 versus 0.9541, the 90th percentile absolute errors were 0.0008 versus 0.0007, and the Brier scores were 0.0093 versus 0.0137. Mean nodule diameter is a better risk predictor than maximum nodule diameter, nodule density or mass. CONCLUSION: The predictive performances of computer and radiologist generated data models were similar. The model can be integrated to the CIRRUS Lung Screening software to automatically generate a nodule malignancy risk score to facilitate nodule management recommendation.

In particular, we investigate the performance of a manually developed Bayesian network under various discretisation schemes to check whether the probabilistic parameters in the initial manual network with continuous features are optimal and correctly reflect the reality. The classification performance was determined using ROC analysis. A few algorithms perform better than the continuous baseline: best was the entropy-based method of Fayyad and Irani, but also simpler algorithms did outperform the continuous baseline. Two simpler methods with only 3 bins per variable gave results similar to the continuous baseline. These results indicate that it is worthwhile to consider discretising continuous data when developing Bayesian networks and support the practical importance of probabilitistic parameters in determining the network's performance.},

Six radiologists, three experienced with 1v-DBT in screening, retrospectively reviewed 181 cases (76 malignant, 50 benign, 55 normal) in two sessions. First, they scored sequentially: 1v-DBT (medio-lateral oblique, MLO), 1v-DBT (MLO) + 1v-DM (cranio-caudal, CC) and two-view DM + DBT (2v-DM+2v-DBT). The second session involved only 2v-DM. Lesions were scored using BI-RADS(r) and level of suspiciousness (1-10). Sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and jack-knife alternative free-response ROC (JAFROC) were computed. On average, 1v-DBT was non-inferior to any of the other protocols in terms of JAFROC figure-of-merit, area under ROC curve, sensitivity or specificity (p>0.391). While readers inexperienced with 1v-DBT screening improved their sensitivity when adding more images (69-79 %, p=0.019), experienced readers showed similar sensitivity (76 %) and specificity (70 %) between 1v-DBT and 2v-DM+2v-DBT (p=0.482). Subanalysis by lesion type and breast density showed no difference among modalities. Detection performance with 1v-DBT is not statistically inferior to 2v-DM or to 2v-DM+2v-DBT; its use as a stand-alone modality might be sufficient for readers experienced with this protocol. * One-view breast tomosynthesis is not inferior to two-view digital mammography. * One-view DBT is not inferior to 2-view DM plus 2-view DBT. * Training may lead to 1v-DBT being sufficient for screening.},

  abstract = {Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has superior detection performance than mammography (DM) for population-based breast cancer screening, but the higher number of images that must be reviewed poses a challenge for its implementation. This may be ameliorated by creating a twodimensional synthetic mammographic image (SM) from the DBT volume, containing the most relevant information. When creating a SM, it is of utmost importance to have an accurate lesion localization detection algorithm, while segmenting fibroglandular tissue could also be beneficial. These tasks encounter an extra challenge when working with images in the medio-lateral oblique view, due to the presence of the pectoral muscle, which has similar radiographic density. In this work, we present an automatic pectoral muscle segmentation model based on a u-net deep learning architecture, trained with 136 DBT images acquired with a single system (different BIRADS (r) densities and pathological findings). The model was tested on 36 DBT images from that same system resulting in a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.977 (0.967-0.984). In addition, the model was tested on 125 images from two different systems and three different modalities (DBT, SM, DM), obtaining DSCs between 0.947 and 0.970, a range determined visually to provide adequate segmentations. For reference, a resident radiologist independently annotated a mix of 25 cases obtaining a DSC of 0.971. The results suggest the possibility of using this model for inter-manufacturer DBT, DM and SM tasks that benefit from the segmentation of the pectoral muscle, such as SM generation, computer aided detection systems, or patient dosimetry algorithms.},

  abstract = {Background The image quality of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) volumes depends greatly on the reconstruction algorithm. Purpose To compare two DBT reconstruction algorithms used by the Siemens Mammomat Inspiration system, filtered back projection (FBP), and FBP with iterative optimizations (EMPIRE), using qualitative analysis by human readers and detection performance of machine learning algorithms. Material and Methods Visual grading analysis was performed by four readers specialized in breast imaging who scored 100 cases reconstructed with both algorithms (70 lesions). Scoring (5-point scale: 1 = poor to 5 = excellent quality) was performed on presence of noise and artifacts, visualization of skin-line and Cooper's ligaments, contrast, and image quality, and, when present, lesion visibility. In parallel, a three-dimensional deep-learning convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) was trained (n = 259 patients, 51 positives with BI-RADS 3, 4, or 5 calcifications) and tested (n = 46 patients, nine positives), separately with FBP and EMPIRE volumes, to discriminate between samples with and without calcifications. The partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (pAUC) of each 3D-CNN was used for comparison. Results EMPIRE reconstructions showed better contrast (3.23 vs. 3.10, P = 0.010), image quality (3.22 vs. 3.03, P < 0.001), visibility of calcifications (3.53 vs. 3.37, P = 0.053, significant for one reader), and fewer artifacts (3.26 vs. 2.97, P < 0.001). The 3D-CNN-EMPIRE had better performance than 3D-CNN-FBP (pAUC-EMPIRE = 0.880 vs. pAUC-FBP = 0.857; P < 0.001). Conclusion The new algorithm provides DBT volumes with better contrast and image quality, fewer artifacts, and improved visibility of calcifications for human observers, as well as improved detection performance with deep-learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {To study the feasibility of automatically identifying normal digital mammography (DM) exams with artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce the breast cancer screening reading workload. A total of 2652 DM exams (653 cancer) and interpretations by 101 radiologists were gathered from nine previously performed multi-reader multi-case receiver operating characteristic (MRMC ROC) studies. An AI system was used to obtain a score between 1 and 10 for each exam, representing the likelihood of cancer present. Using all AI scores between 1 and 9 as possible thresholds, the exams were divided into groups of low- and high likelihood of cancer present. It was assumed that, under the pre-selection scenario, only the high-likelihood group would be read by radiologists, while all low-likelihood exams would be reported as normal. The area under the reader-averaged ROC curve (AUC) was calculated for the original evaluations and for the pre-selection scenarios and compared using a non-inferiority hypothesis. Setting the low/high-likelihood threshold at an AI score of 5 (high likelihood > 5) results in a trade-off of approximately halving (- 47%) the workload to be read by radiologists while excluding 7% of true-positive exams. Using an AI score of 2 as threshold yields a workload reduction of 17% while only excluding 1% of true-positive exams. Pre-selection did not change the average AUC of radiologists (inferior 95% CI > - 0.05) for any threshold except at the extreme AI score of 9. It is possible to automatically pre-select exams using AI to significantly reduce the breast cancer screening reading workload. * There is potential to use artificial intelligence to automatically reduce the breast cancer screening reading workload by excluding exams with a low likelihood of cancer. * The exclusion of exams with the lowest likelihood of cancer in screening might not change radiologists' breast cancer detection performance. * When excluding exams with the lowest likelihood of cancer, the decrease in true-positive recalls would be balanced by a simultaneous reduction in false-positive recalls.},

  abstract = {Digitization and CRT display reduce sharpness of mammograms. To ensure image quality on a CRT, comparable to the quality of original films, a modified unsharp-masking (USM) algorithm is proposed to correct for this reduction. This study evaluates the clinical value of this algorithm and determines the optimal setting of its parameters. Eight complete mammographic cases were processed by a modified USM algorithm with 19 settings for three parameters, resulting in 152 stimuli. All cases showed a clearly visible mass; five also contained microcalcifications. The modification of the standard USM algorithm consisted of selectively improving low contrasts. Moreover, the USM enhancement was made grey value dependent to avoid clipping. Four experienced screening radiologists and four physicists (having experience with mammography imaging) rated all mammograms on a 1-10 point scale, according to image quality and suitability for diagnosis. The images were randomly presented. Before the experiment started, a subset of the images was shown to familiarize the observers to the range of images and parameter settings. For a contrast enhancement factor of about 0.4, the processed mammograms appeared to be significantly better than the original digitized mammograms (P<.001). Differences in the results for the radiologists and the physicists were small.},

  abstract = {Objective: The pathogenesis of serous ovarian carcinoma (SOC) is still unknown. Recently, endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (EIC) was proposed to be the precursor lesion of SOC. This study examines the model of EIC as precursor for SOC. Methods: Cases of SOC with a noninvasive or superficially invasive serous lesion, a hyperplastic lesion with/without atypia, or EIC in the endometrium were selected for inclusion in this study. Tissue sections from both ovaries, the fallopian tubes, and the uterus were extensively reviewed by an expert gynecopathologist. For both EIC and SOC, immunostaining for p53, Ki-67, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor; TP53 mutation analysis; and in situ ploidy analysis were performed. Results: Nine cases of SOC with concurrent EIC in the endometrium were identified. Immunostaining for p53, Ki-67, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor revealed almost identical expression patterns and similar intensities in each pair of EIC and coincidentSOC.IdenticalTP53mutationswerefoundinSOCandcoincidingEICin33%ofthe cases, suggesting a clonal origin. DNA ploidy analysis, as a marker for neoplastic progression, demonstrated an increased number of aneuploid nuclei in SOC compared to their corresponding EIC (P = 0.039). In addition, the mean amount of DNA per nucleus in SOC was higher (ie, more aneuploid) compared to EIC (P = 0.039). Conclusion: This study provides a first indication of EIC as possible precursor lesion for SOC. This finding could have major clinical implications for future ovarian cancer management and underscores EIC as a possible target for early SOC detection and prevention.},

  title = {AI-Assisted Biparametric MRI Surveillance of Prostate Cancer: Feasibility Study},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of automatic longitudinal analysis of consecutive biparametric MRI (bpMRI) scans to detect clinically significant (cs) prostate cancer (PCa). METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study included a multi-center dataset of 1539 patients who underwent bpMRI (T2 + DWI) between 2014--2020, of whom 105 patients underwent at least two consecutive bpMRI before biopsy without pathologically confirmed csPCa prior to follow-up. A deep learning prostate cancer detection model was developed and trained to produce a heatmap of all PIRADS>=2 lesions across baseline and current studies. The aligned heatmaps for each patient's baseline and current examination were used to extract differential volumetric and likelihood features reflecting explainable changes between examinations. A logistic classifier was trained to predict from these features csPCa (ISUP>1) at the time of the current examination according to biopsy. A model trained on the current study only was developed for comparison.  An extended model was developed incorporating clinical parameters (PSA density and age). Cross-validation was performed to assess the detection performance of the models on unseen data. The diagnostic performance of the best model was compared to the radiologist scores. Diagnostic accuracies are compared using likelihood ratio tests and ROC analysis. RESULTS: The model including baseline and current study (AUC 0.73 CI: 0.49 0.89) performed better than the current only model (AUC 0.70 CI: 0.42 0.86), and significantly (P=0.002) improved fit. Adding clinical variables further improved diagnostic performance (AUC 0.79 CI: 0.60 0.94). The extended surveillance model's performance was comparable to that of the radiologist (AUC 0.69 CI: 0.52 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed AI-assisted surveillance of prostate MRI can pick up explainable,  diagnostically relevant changes with promising diagnostic accuracy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Research on artificial intelligence that integrates longitudinal information from follow-up prostate MRI is lacking.},

Histogram-based selective deblurring (HiSD) is a deconvolution method that restores small high-density structures, i.e., calcifications, of a CT image, using the high-intensity voxel information of the deconvolved image, while preserving the original hounsfield Units (HUs) in the remaining tissues. In this study, high resolution micro-CT data are used to validate the potential of HiSD to improve calcium visualization and quantification in the carotid arteries on in vivo contrast-enhanced CTA data. The evaluation is performed qualitatively and quantitatively on 15 atherosclerotic plaques obtained from ten different patients. HiSD in combination with vessel segmentation significantly improves calcification visualization and quantification on in vivo contrast-enhanced CT images. Calcification blur is reduced, while avoiding noise amplification and edge-ringing artifacts in the surrounding tissues. Calcification quantification errors are reduced by 23.5\% on average.},

The improved signal-to-noise ratio found with CR and AMBER resulted in a better visualization of structures in the mediastinum and basal lung than that found with CR alone. For the central lung, no improvement was seen. Because of the compressed dynamic range with CR and AMBER, contrast on hard copies and video monitors could be high without a sacrifice in image latitude. Dual-energy images showed a considerably lower noise level. The combined use of AMBER and CR promises to overcome the dynamic range limitations of digital displays while improving signal-to-noise ratio.},

Eight healthy volunteers were prospectively imaged in this HIPAA-compliant IRB-approved study. Each subject underwent two consecutive scans at both 1.5 and 3.0T, which included breathhold and free-breathing DWI using a wide range of b-values (0 to 800 s/mm?). A blinded observer rated subjective image quality (maximum score= 8), and a separate observer placed regions of interest within the liver, renal cortices, pancreas, and spleen to measure ADC at each field strength. Paired Wilcoxon tests were used to compare abdominal DWI between 1.5T and 3.0T for specific combinations of organs, b-values, and acquisition techniques.Subjective image quality was significantly lower at 3.0T for all comparisons (P = 0.0078- 0.0156). ADC values were similar at 1.5T and 3.0T for all assessed organs, except for lower liver ADC at 3.0T using b0-500-600 and breathhold technique. ADC reproducibility was moderate at both 1.5T and 3.0T, with no significant difference in coefficient of variation of ADC between field strengths.Compared with 1.5T, SS EPI at 3.0T provided generally similar ADC values, however, with worse image quality. Further optimization of abdominal DWI at 3.0T is needed.},

  abstract = {Multi-parametric prostate MRI (mpMRI) is a powerful tool to diagnose prostate cancer, though difficult to interpret even for experienced radiologists. A common radiological procedure is to compare a magnetic resonance image with similarly diagnosed cases. To assist the radiological image interpretation process, computerized Content-Based Image Retrieval systems (CBIRs) can therefore be employed to improve the reporting workflow and increase its accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new, supervised siamese deep learning architecture able to handle multi-modal and multi-view MR images with similar PIRADS score. An experimental comparison with well-established deep learning-based CBIRs (namely standard siamese networks and autoencoders) showed significantly improved performance with respect to both diagnostic (ROC-AUC), and information retrieval metrics (Precision-Recall, Discounted Cumulative Gain and Mean Average Precision). Finally, the new proposed multi-view siamese network is general in design, facilitating a broad use in diagnostic medical imaging retrieval.},

Vessel segmentation is fundamental in computer aided processing of data generated by 3D imaging modalities. As manual vessel segmentation is prohibitively time consuming, any real world application requires some form of automation. Several approaches exist for automated vessel segmentation, but judging their relative merits is difficult due to a lack of standardized evaluation. We present an annotated reference dataset containing 20 {CT} scans and propose nine categories to perform a comprehensive evaluation of vessel segmentation algorithms from both academia and industry. Twenty algorithms participated in the {VESSEL12} challenge, held at International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging ({ISBI}) 2012. All results have been published at the {VESSEL12} website http://{VESSEL12}.grand-challenge.org. The challenge remains ongoing and open to new participants.

Specifically, we trained a GAN to generate complete3D chest computed tomography (CT) scans up to 512x512x128 volumes. Most notably this is motivated by the purpose of anonymizing data for easier sharing and applications for low-dosage radiotherapy planning. Because of the memory and compute requirements, the model was trained on a CPU-based supercomputer. End-to-end model training took +-8 days. Additionally, we propose two metrics for large-resolution 3D volume comparison. In this paper, we report first results using these metrics, hoping to be bettered inthe future.To our knowledge, this is the largest-scale experiment of generative models so far,and the first to generate full-resolution complete 3D CT scans.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with almost 2 million new cases diagnosed every year around the globe. However, despite important improvements in awareness, detection, diagnosis, and treatment, breast cancer is still a major cause of mortality, accounting for approximately 500,000 annual deaths worldwide. Breast cancer mortality has decreased in the past decades, primarily because of the introduction of population-based screening programs with mammography and improvements in therapy. By imaging asymptomatic women periodically, breast cancer can be detected early, improving prognosis. However, these screening programs are far from perfect. The use of mammography -a 2D technique- to image the 3D volume of the breast leads to cancers being missed and for many false positive assessments. Another issue is the current labor-intensive screening workflow, in which radiologists must assess millions of exams yearly, of which actually only less than 1% result in a cancer diagnosis. This screening process is heavily threatened by the increasing scarcity of radiologists.},

  abstract = {Approximately 15% of all breast cancers occur in women with a family history of breast cancer, but for whom no causative hereditary gene mutation has been found. Screening guidelines for women with familial risk of breast cancer differ between countries. We did a randomised controlled trial (FaMRIsc) to compare MRI screening with mammography in women with familial risk. In this multicentre, randomised, controlled trial done in 12 hospitals in the Netherlands, women were eligible to participate if they were aged 30-55 years and had a cumulative lifetime breast cancer risk of at least 20% because of a familial predisposition, but were BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 wild-type. Participants who were breast-feeding, pregnant, had a previous breast cancer screen, or had a previous a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ were eligible, but those with a previously diagnosed invasive carcinoma were excluded. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either annual MRI and clinical breast examination plus biennial mammography (MRI group) or annual mammography and clinical breast examination (mammography group). Randomisation was done via a web-based system and stratified by centre. Women who did not provide consent for randomisation could give consent for registration if they followed either the mammography group protocol or the MRI group protocol in a joint decision with their physician. Results from the registration group were only used in the analyses stratified by breast density. Primary outcomes were number, size, and nodal status of detected breast cancers. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, number NL2661. Between Jan 1, 2011, and Dec 31, 2017, 1355 women provided consent for randomisation and 231 for registration. 675 of 1355 women were randomly allocated to the MRI group and 680 to the mammography group. 218 of 231 women opting to be in a registration group were in the mammography registration group and 13 were in the MRI registration group. The mean number of screening rounds per woman was 4*3 (SD 1*76). More breast cancers were detected in the MRI group than in the mammography group (40 vs 15; p=0*0017). Invasive cancers (24 in the MRI group and eight in the mammography group) were smaller in the MRI group than in the mammography group (median size 9 mm [5-14] vs 17 mm [13-22]; p=0*010) and less frequently node positive (four [17%] of 24 vs five [63%] of eight; p=0*023). Tumour stages of the cancers detected at incident rounds were significantly earlier in the MRI group (12 [48%] of 25 in the MRI group vs one [7%] of 15 in the mammography group were stage T1a and T1b cancers; one (4%) of 25 in the MRI group and two (13%) of 15 in the mammography group were stage T2 or higher; p=0*035) and node-positive tumours were less frequent (two [11%] of 18 in the MRI group vs five [63%] of eight in the mammography group; p=0*014). All seven tumours stage T2 or higher were in the two highest breast density categories (breast imaging reporting and data system categories C and D; p=0*0077) One patient died from breast cancer during follow-up (mammography registration group). MRI screening detected cancers at an earlier stage than mammography. The lower number of late-stage cancers identified in incident rounds might reduce the use of adjuvant chemotherapy and decrease breast cancer-related mortality. However, the advantages of the MRI screening approach might be at the cost of more false-positive results, especially at high breast density.

  abstract = {Weakly supervised disease classification of CT imaging suffers from poor localization owing to case-level annotations, where even a positive scan can hold hundreds to thousands of negative slices along multiple planes. Furthermore, although deep learning segmentation and classification models extract distinctly unique combinations of anatomical features from the same target class(es), they are typically seen as two independent processes in a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) pipeline, with little to no feature reuse. In this research, we propose a medical classifier that leverages the semantic structural concepts learned via multi-resolution segmentation feature maps, to guide weakly supervised 3D classification of chest CT volumes. Additionally, a comparative analysis is drawn across two different types of feature aggregation to explore the vast possibilities surrounding feature fusion. Using a dataset of 1593 scans labeled on a case-level basis via rule-based model, we train a dual-stage convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform organ segmentation and binary classification of four representative diseases (emphysema, pneumonia/atelectasis, mass and nodules) in lungs. The baseline model, with separate stages for segmentation and classification, results in AUC of 0.791. Using identical hyperparameters, the connected architecture using static and dynamic feature aggregation improves performance to AUC of 0.832 and 0.851, respectively. This study advances the field in two key ways. First, case-level report data is used to weakly supervise a 3D CT classifier of multiple, simultaneous diseases for an organ. Second, segmentation and classification models are connected with two different feature aggregation strategies to enhance the classification performance.},

  title = {Computer-Aided Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in mpMRI},
  abstract = {Non-invasive multiparametric MR imaging (mpMRI) can facilitate the early detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). However, interpretation of radiological findings is susceptible to overdiagnosis and low inter-reader agreement, as current assessment standards share a limited ability to distinguish csPCa from benign prostate cancer (PCa) and other non-malignant conditions. In this research, we propose a novel multi-stage computer-aided detection (CAD) model to perform automated voxel-level detection of csPCa in prostate mpMRI. The model is driven by convolutional neural networks (CNN), which use anisotropically-strided 3D convolutions to leverage the spatial context between adjacent MRI slices, without forgoing computational efficiency. It combines spatial and channel-wise attention mechanisms to adaptively target the most salient prostatic structures and discriminative feature dimensions in mpMRI volumes, at multiple resolutions. It uses an additional 3D residual classifier for independent false positive reduction. Finally, it exploits an anatomical prior, which captures the spatial prevalence of csPCa and its zonal distinction, to infuse clinical priori into the CNN architecture for guided inference and feature extraction. For 487 institutional testing scans, the 3D CAD system achieves 83.95% and 89.94% detection sensitivity at 0.5 and 1.0 false positive per patient, respectively, along with 0.884 AUROC in patient-based diagnosis. For 296 external testing scans, the 3D CAD system exhibits moderate agreement with a consensus of expert radiologists (77.70%; kappa = 0.543) and independent pathologists (78.04%; kappa = 0.527), thereby demonstrating a strong ability to generalize to histologically-confirmed csPCa detection using radiologist-supported training samples only.},

Deep attention mechanisms drive its detection network, targeting salient structures and highly discriminative feature dimensions across multiple resolutions. Its goal is to accurately identify csPCa lesions from indolent cancer and the wide range of benign pathology that can afflict the prostate gland. Simultaneously, a decoupled residual classifier is used to achieve consistent false positive reduction, without sacrificing high sensitivity or computational efficiency. In order to guide model generalization with domain-specific clinical knowledge, a probabilistic anatomical prior is used to encode the spatial prevalence and zonal distinction of csPCa. Using a large dataset of 1950 prostate bpMRI paired with radiologically-estimated annotations, we hypothesize that such CNN-based models can be trained to detect biopsy-confirmed malignancies in an independent cohort.

We investigate distribution, region and boundary-based loss functions for both tasks across 200 patient exams from the publicly-available ProstateX dataset. For evaluation, we conduct a thorough comparative analysis of model predictions and calibration, measured with respect to multi-class volume segmentation of the prostate anatomy (whole-gland, transitional zone, peripheral zone), as well as, patient-level diagnosis and lesion-level detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. Notably, we find that distribution-based loss functions (in particular, focal loss) are well-suited for diagnostic or panoptic segmentation tasks such as lesion detection, primarily due to their implicit property of inducing better calibration. Meanwhile, (with the exception of focal loss) both distribution and region/boundary-based loss functions perform equally well for anatomical or semantic segmentation tasks, such as quantification of organ shape, size and boundaries.},

  title = {Deep Learning with Bayesian Inference for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis across Longitudinal Biparametric MRI},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite increasing use of active surveillance via biparametric MR imaging (bpMRI) for prostate cancer (PCa) management, there is a lack of research in medical image computing that utilize longitudinal studies to assist present-day diagnosis. PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of a deep learning-based PCa detection model, that integrates past bpMRI exams and population-level ana-tomical priors via Bayesian inference. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 250 consecutive biopsy-naive men (median age: 64 yrs; IQR: 60-69) with elevated levels of PSA (me-dian level: 8 ng/mL; IQR: 5-11), who underwent at least two consecutive MRI exams between 2016-2018 (N=500). Intra-patient bpMRI scans were rigidly registered, paired with expert voxel-level annotations of PI-RADS 2-5 lesions and subsequently used to train a deep learning model to predict and localize all PI-RADS findings. Radiologists utilize prior studies to inform present-day diagnosis. Similar-ly, for each patient case, computer-aided diagnosis for the follow-up bpMRI exam was derived via Bayesian modelling; probabilistical-ly integrating past bpMRI exams and a population prior for spatial PCa prevalence and zonal anatomy. Diagnostic performance was evaluated by the ability to accurately discriminate patients with benign prostatic tissue (n=10) or PI-RADS <= 3 lesions (n=159), from those carrying PI-RADS >= 4 lesions (n=81), over 5-fold cross-validation. Normalized Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U statistic was used to derive AUROC and confidence intervals were computed over 5000 replications of bootstrapping. RESULTS: Computer-aided diagnosis of follow-up studies without priori, yielded an AUROC of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.83), F0.5 score of 0.51 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.61), positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.51 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.60) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.83). Computer-aided diagnosis of follow-up studies with the inclusion of priori via Bayesian inference yielded an AUROC of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.84), F0.5 score of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.68), PPV of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.72) and NPV of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.85).In comparison to stand-alone diagnosis, factoring in prior studies resulted in a 41.4% reduction of AUROC standard deviation across each fold. CONCLUSION: Incorporating past studies and clinical priors via Bayesian inference can improve diagnostic certainty and robustness of deep learning in follow-up patient exams. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in men worldwide. In the absence of experienced radiologists, its morphological heterogeneity can lead to low inter-reader agreement. Automated, reliable detection algorithms can improve diagnostic accuracy with consistent quantitative analysis.},

  title = {Artificial Intelligence and Radiologists at Prostate Cancer Detection in MRI: The PI-CAI Challenge},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: The PI-CAI challenge aims to validate the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence (AI) and radiologists at clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection/diagnosis in MRI, with histopathology and follow-up (>= 3 years) as reference. The study hypothesizes that state-of-the-art AI algorithms, trained using thousands of patient exams, are non-inferior to radiologists reading bpMRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study tentatively includes 12,373 prostate MRI exams (11,193 patients) between 2012 and 2021, curated from three Dutch centers and one Norwegian center. All patient exams are of men suspected of harboring csPCa, without a history of treatment or prior positive histopathology (Gleason Grade Group >= 2) findings. Acquisitions were obtained using Siemens Healthineers or Philips Medical Systems-based 1.5T/3T MRI scanners. In total, 11,373 cases are available to develop and train AI solutions in the framework of a grand challenge. The remaining 1000 unseen cases are reserved for testing. A subset of 400 testing cases is used to facilitate a reader study with 63 radiologists (42 centers, 18 countries; 1-23 years of experience reading prostate MRI {median: 9 years}). Readers perform their assessments sequentially for each patient: first, using bpMRI sequences only; secondly, using full mpMRI sequences (in compliance with PI-RADS v2.1). Multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) analysis is used to compare the overall patient-level diagnostic performance of readers against that of the top five AI algorithms. Non-inferiority is tested with a significance margin of 0.05. Permutation tests are used to statistically compare AI and radiologists' performance at PI-RADS operating points. The PI-CAI challenge spans 7 months (May-November 2022) in duration. Key aspects of its study protocol have been established in conjunction with an international scientific advisory board of 16 experts in prostate AI, radiology, and urology --to unify and standardize present-day guidelines, and ensure meaningful validation of prostate-AI towards clinical translation. RESULTS: Preliminary results of the PI-CAI challenge will be presented. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Prostate MRI assessments show high inter-reader variability (>50%), long reporting times, and strong dependence on expertise. A thorough comparison of AI with radiologists builds trust, allowing AI to help improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce workload.},

Methods: We evaluated data of 1828 AMD patients and 1715 controls enrolled in the European Genetic Database. All subjects underwent ophthalmologic examination, including visual acuity testing and fundus photography. Images were graded and fundus photographs were used for automatic drusen quantification by a machine learning algorithm. Data on disease characteristics, family history, medical history and lifestyle habits were obtained by a questionnaire. Results: The age at first symptoms was significantly lower in AMD patients with a positive family history (68.7 years) than in AMD patients with no family history (71.8 years; P = 1.9x10-5). Risk factors identified in sporadic and familial subjects were increasing age (OR 1.08 per year; P = 3.0x10-51 and OR 1.15; P = 5.3x10-36, respectively) and smoking (OR 1.01 per pack year; P = 1.1x10-6 and OR 1.02; P = 0.005). Physical activity and daily red meat consumption were significantly associated with AMD in sporadic subjects only (OR 0.49; P = 3.7x10-10 and OR 1.81; P = 0.001). With regard to the phenotype, geographic atrophy and cuticular drusen were significantly more prevalent in familial AMD (17.5\% and 21.7\%, respectively) as compared to sporadic AMD (9.8\% and 12.1\%). Conclusions: Familial AMD patients become symptomatic at a younger age. The higher prevalence of geographic atrophy and cuticular drusen in the familial AMD cases may be explained by the contribution of additional genetic factors segregating within families.},

  abstract = {{M}ost computer aided detection ({CAD}) systems for mammographic mass detection display all suspicious regions identified by computer algorithms and are mainly intended to avoid missing cancers due to perceptual oversights. {C}onsidering that interpretation failure is recognized to be a more common cause of missing cancers in screening than perceptual oversights, a dedicated mammographic {CAD} system has been developed that can be queried interactively for the presence of {CAD} prompts using a mouse click. {T}o assess the potential benefit of using {CAD} in an interactive way, an observer study was conducted in which 4 radiologists and 6 non-radiologists evaluated 60 cases with and without {CAD}, to compare the detection performance of the unaided reader with that of the reader with {CAD} assistance. 20 cases had a malignant mass, and 40 were cancer-free. {D}uring the reading sessions we recorded time and probed locations which reveal information about the search strategy and detection process. {T}he purpose of this study is to determine a relation between detection performance and time to first probe of the lesion and to investigate if longer reading times lead to more reports of malignant lesions in lesion-free areas. {O}n average, 65.0% of the malignant lesions were found within 60 seconds and this percentage stabilizes after this period. {R}esults suggest that longer reading time did not lead to more false positives. 74.6% of the reported true positive findings were hit by the first probe, and 93.2% were hit within 5 probes, which may suggest that many of the correctly reported malignant masses were perceived immediately after image onset.},

  abstract = {Background: Contrary to what may be expected, finding abnormalities in complex images like pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs is not dominated by time-consuming search strategies but by an almost immediate global interpretation. This was already known in the nineteen-seventies from experiments with briefly flashed chest radiographs. Later on, experiments with eye-trackers showed that abnormalities attracted the attention quite fast but often without further reader actions. Prolonging one's search seldom leads to newly found abnormalities and may even increase the chance of errors. The problem of reading chest radiographs is therefore not dominated by finding the abnormalities, but by interpreting them. Hypothesis: This suggests that readers could benefit from computer-aided detection (CAD) systems not so much by their ability to prompt potential abnormalities, but more from their ability to `interpret' the potential abnormalities. In this paper, this hypothesis was investigated by an observer experiment. Experiment: In one condition, the traditional CAD condition, the most suspicious CAD locations were shown to the subjects, without telling them the levels of suspiciousness according to CAD. In the other condition, interactive CAD condition, levels of suspiciousness were given, but only when readers requested them at specified locations. These two conditions focus on decreasing search errors and decision errors, respectively. Results of reading without CAD were also recorded. Six subjects, all non-radiologists, read 223 chest radiographs in both conditions. CAD results were obtained from the OnGuard 5.0 system developed by Riverain Medical (Miamisburg, Ohio). Results: The observer data were analyzed by Location Response Operating Characteristic analysis (LROC). It was found that: 1) With the aid of CAD, the performance is significantly better than without CAD; 2) The performance with interactive CAD is significantly better than with traditional CAD at low false positive rates.},

  abstract = {When reading mammograms, radiologists combine information from multiple views to detect abnormalities. Most computer-aided detection {(CAD)} systems, however, use primitive methods for inclusion of multi-view context or analyze each view independently. In previous research it was found that in mammography lesion-based detection performance of {CAD} systems can be improved when correspondences between {MLO} and {CC} views are taken into account. However, detection at case level detection did not improve. In this paper, we propose a new learning method for multi-view {CAD} systems, which is aimed at optimizing case-based detection performance. The method builds on a single-view lesion detection system and a correspondence classifier. The latter provides class probabilities for the various types of region pairs and correspondence features. The correspondence classifier output is used to bias the selection of training patterns for a multi-view {CAD} system. In this way training can be forced to focus on optimization of case-based detection performance. The method is applied to the problem of detecting malignant masses and architectural distortions. Experiments involve 454 mammograms consisting of 4 views with a malignant region visible in at least one of the views. To evaluate performance, 5-fold cross validation and {FROC} analysis was performed. Bootstrapping was used for statistical analysis. A significant increase of case-based detection performance was found when the proposed method was used. Mean sensitivity increased by 4.7% in the range of 0.01-0.5 false positives per image.},

  title = {Retinal image analysis by mixture model based clustering and discriminant analysis for automatic detection of hard exudates and haemorhages: A tool for diabetic retinopathy screening},
  abstract = {Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a disorder of the retinal vasculature that eventually develops to some degree in nearly all patients with diabetes. The growing incidence of diabetes has caused DR to become the major cause of blindness and vision defects in developed countries. In view of the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and DR throughout most of the world, mass screening is time consuming and requires many trained graders to examine the fundus photographs searching for retinal lesions. A reliable method for automated assessment of the presence of lesions in fundus images would be a valuable tool in assisting the limited number of professional and reducing the examination time. Additionally, this system could be a useful clinical aid in the routine eye care by displaying retinal images with enhanced details and facilitating diagnosis. This thesis aims at developing a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) technology to assist ophthalmologists in DR screening programs, in order to detect and quantify early signs associated with DR in fundus photographs. In the onset of the disease, several visual retinal abnormalities appear in the retinal fundus, including red lesions, such as microaneurysms and haemorrhages, and white lesions, such as hard exudates and cotton-wool spots. Among these lesions, haemorrhages and hard exudates are the most prevalent in background retinopathy Therefore, their detection is critical for DR mass screening. Additionally, hard exudates represent the most specific maker for the presence of coexistent retinal oedema, the major cause of visual loss in the nonproliferative forms of DR. The principal aim of this work is to develop novel computer methods to automatically detect and quantify haemorrhages and hard exudates in retinal images as an aid for the DR diagnosis in screening programs. As a first step, several methods are studied for the automatic detection of anatomical structures: the optic disk, the blood vessels and the posterior pole. The detection of these features provides a retinal coordinate system for retinopathy grading. Besides, their localization is indispensable to reduce the number of false detections due to their similarities to retinal signs in terms of brightness and contrast. Different image analysis techniques, such as wavelets, mathematical morphology and Expectation Maximization algorithm, are investigated to address the localisation of the optic disk, blood vessels and the vascular arcades. The automatic detection of haemorrhages and hard exudates relies on an innovative initial image segmentation based on mixture model based clustering, followed by a subsequent refinement stage using supervised classification. The clustering process considers the probability distribution function of the entire image as a mixture of individual distributions. The resulting pixel-cluster memberships provide a transformation of the pixels into different image regions which are suspected of corresponding to retinal lesions. Finally, a study of different discriminant analysis techniques, such as linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, logistic regression and k nearest neighbours, is performed to classify regions into haemorrhages or hard exudates. Therefore, an interpretation of the retinal image will be achieved detecting DR signs and identifying retinal images with the presence of these ocular symptoms.},

A previously developed, comprehensive DR CAD system was applied to the 1200 digital color fundus photographs (non-mydriatic camera, single field) of 1200 eyes in the publicly available "Messidor" dataset. The ability of the system to distinguish normal images from those with DR was determined using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Two human experts also determined the presence of DR in each of the images. Results. The system achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.876 for successfully distinguishing normal images from those with DR with a sensitivity of 92.2\% at a specificity of 50\%. This compares favorably with the two human experts who achieved sensitivities of 94.5\% and 91.2\% at specificity 50\%. Conclusions. This study shows, for the first time, the performance of a comprehensive DR screening system on an independent, publicly available dataset. The performance of the system on this dataset is comparable to that of human experts.},

  abstract = {Contextual information plays an important role in medical image understanding. Medical experts make use of context to detect and differentiate pathologies in medical images, especially when interpreting difficult cases. The majority of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, however, employ only local information to classify candidates, without taking into account global image information or the relation of a candidate with neighboring structures. In this paper, we present a generic system for including contextual information in a CAD system. Context is described by means of high-level features based on the spatial relation between lesion candidates and surrounding anatomical landmarks and lesions of different classes (static contextual features) and lesions of the same type (dynamic contextual features). We demonstrate the added value of contextual CAD for two real-world CAD tasks: the identification of exudates and drusen in 2D retinal images and coronary calcifications in 3D computed tomography scans. Results show that in both applications contextual CAD is superior to a local CAD approach with a significant increase of the figure of merit of the Free Receiver Operating Characteristic curve from 0.84 to 0.92 and from 0.88 to 0.98 for exudates and drusen, respectively, and from 0.87 to 0.93 for coronary calcifications.},

  title = {Automatic quantification of geographic atrophy in fundus autofluorescence images of Stargardt patients},
  abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate an observer-independent image analysis algorithm that automatically quantifies the area of geographic atrophy in fundus autofluorescence images of Stargardt patients. Methods: Fundus autofluorescence images of 20 eyes of 20 Stargardt patients with presence of one delineated or patchy atrophy region in the macular area were selected. An image analysis algorithm was developed to automatically segment the area of atrophy starting from an arbitrarily selected seed point inside the atrophy region. The method was based on a combination of region growing algorithm and a dynamic, user-independent threshold selection procedure using Otsu thresholding. In order to assess the performance obtained by the proposed algorithm, manual annotations were made by an experienced human grader. The grader manually delineated the atrophy areas on the same set of images using dedicated software developed for this task. Results: A high correlation was observed between the manual area measurements and the automatically quantified values obtained by the proposed algorithm, with a mean intra-class correlation coefficient ({ICC}) value larger than 0.89. In addition, the quantification time was reduced substantially by a factor of 27 compared to manual assessment. The output of the software was also shown to be independent of the user input and highly reproducible, with an {ICC} value larger than 0.99 between two executions of the algorithm at different time points and with different seed points. Conclusions: An image analysis algorithm for automatic quantification of geographic atrophy in autofluorescence images of Stargardt patients was developed. The proposed algorithm allows for precise, reproducible and fast quantification of the atrophy area, providing an accurate procedure to measure disease progression and assess potential therapies in large dataset analyses independent of human observers.},

  title = {Simultaneous multi-slice single-shot DWI compared to routine read-out-segmented DWI for evaluation of breast lesions},
  booktitle = ISMRM,
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Synopsis
                             The aim of this study was to compare a prototype simultaneous multi-slice single-shot echo planar imaging (SMS-ss-DWI-EPI) sequence with
                             conventional readout-segmented echo-planar imaging (rs-DWI-EPI) for diffusion-weighted imaging of the breast at 3T magnetic resonance
                             imaging (MRI). A reader study was conducted to evaluate image quality, lesion conspicuity and BI-RADS score. Our results show that although
                             the image quality with the conventional rs-DWI-EPI is superior, malignant lesions have improved visibility with the SMS-ss-DWI-EPI sequence.

                             Introduction
                             The addition of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to contrast-enhanced breast MRI improves the classification of breast lesions, which leads in turn to an
                             increased positive predictive value of biopsies. Consequently, DWI with evaluation of the corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is included in
                             most state-of-the-art breast MRI protocols . The echo train of the readout-segmented echo-planar imaging-based DWI sequence (rs-DWI-EPI) was
                             shortened to reduce distortion and improve the resulting image quality. However, this sequence results in a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than singleshot
                             echo planar imaging (ss-EPI) . In practice, detection of lesions on DWI is often problematic due to a relatively low lesion conspicuity. To improve the
                             detectability of lesions and the speed of acquisition, a prototype DWI sequence, the simultaneous multi-slice single-shot DWI-EPI (SMS-ss-DWI-EPI), was
                             developed. In this study we compare this prototype sequence with rs-DWI-EPI at 3T, in terms of image quality (IQ), lesion conspicuity, and breast imaging
                             reporting and data system (BI-RADS ) score.

                             Methods
                             From September 2017 to August 2018, 15 women with known breast cancer or suspicious breast lesions were included, after providing signed informed
                             consent. Women were scanned with the conventional rs-DWI-EPI and the SMS-ss-DWI-EPI during the same clinical examination on a 3T MAGNETOM
                             Skyra system (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) using a 16-channel bilateral breast coil. Parameters of the rs-DWI-EPI sequence were: TR: 5450
                             ms, TE: 57 ms, FoV: 340 mm, voxel size: 1.2x1.2x5 mm , acquisition time: 4:23 min, b-values: 50, 850 s/mm , SPAIR fat suppression. Parameters of the
                             SMS-ss-DWI-EPI sequence were: TR: 4000 ms, TE: 70 ms, FoV: 360 mm, voxel size: 0.9(i)x0.9(i)x4 mm , acquisition time: 2:45 min, b-values: 50, 400,
                             800 s/mm , SPAIR fat suppression. In addition, the clinical protocol included one pre- and five post-contrast administration regular T1-weighted Dixon
                             acquisitions, ultrafast T1-weighted TWIST acquisitions during the inflow of contrast, and a T2 weighted Dixon acquisition. In total, 33 lesions (27 malignant,
                             5 benign and 1 unknown) were detected on the contrast-enhanced series and described in the clinical MRI reports. Two dedicated breast radiologists (4
                             and 10 years of experience with breast MRI) independently scored both sequences for overall IQ (1: extremely poor to 9: excellent). All lesions were also
                             independently evaluated for conspicuity (1: not visible, 2: visible if location is given, 3: visible), and a BI-RADS score (1 to 5) was given for each lesion.
                             Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

                             Results
                             Results are presented in Table 1. Overall IQ was significantly higher for the conventional rs-DWI-EPI than for the SMS-ss-DWI-EPI (p=0.006). Lesion
                             conspicuity scores were significantly higher for SMS-ss-DWI-EPI (p=0.016). Benign lesions had similar conspicuity with both sequences while malignant
                             lesions had significantly higher conspicuity with SMS-ss-DWI-EPI (p=0.027) (for example, see Figure 1). There was no significant difference in BI-RADS
                             scores (p=0.151) between the two sequences.

                             Discussion
                             Although the conventional rs-DWI-EPI sequence results in better IQ, in general ss-EPI results in a higher SNR, which may lead to better visibility of
                             malignant lesions with SMS-ss-DWI-EPI. This might eventually improve the clinical value of DWI in addition to contrast enhanced breast MRI.
                             Simultaneous Multi-Slice (SMS) ensures that slices are excited simultaneously with a multiband pulse, which leads to a reduced acquisition time. In our
                             protocol, the combination of ss-EPI and SMS results in a higher spatial resolution while still having a shorter acquisition time than the conventional
                             sequence. The higher achievable spatial resolution may be an important factor for the improved lesion visibility, and conspicuity of malignant lesions. This
                             may make the SMS approach suitable for fast screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. Still, further development of the SMS-ss-DWI-EPI sequence is
                             needed for improved IQ and even better lesion conspicuity. Extension of the data pool and evaluation by additional readers is pending.

                             Conclusion
                             Despite the perceived poorer image quality of the SMS-ss-DWI-EPI sequence, malignant lesions are better visualized using this sequence. When image
                             quality and conspicuity are further improved, this technique might enable improved lesion detection on unenhanced diffusion weighted breast MRI.},

A systematic search of the literature was performed using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane databases to identify relevant studies published between January 2002 and April 2018. Studies were considered eligible for inclusion if they evaluated the diagnostic or therapeutic accuracy or safety of BLES. Ultimately, 17 articles were included. The reported underestimation rates of atypical ductal hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) ranged from 0 to 14.3% and from 0 to 22.2%, respectively. Complete excision rates for invasive ductal carcinoma and DCIS ranged from 5.3 to 76.3%. Bleeding was the most frequently reported complication (0-11.8%). Device-related complications may arise, with an empty basket being the most common (0.6-3.6%). Thermal damage of the specimen, caused by the use of a radiofrequency cutting wire, was reported in eight of the included studies. Most thermal artifacts were reported as superficial and small (0.1-1.9 mm). The BLES, an automated, image-guided, single-pass biopsy system for breast lesions using radiofrequency is designed to excise and retrieve an intact tissue specimen. It is an efficient and safe breast biopsy method with acceptable complication rates, which may be used as an alternative to vacuum-assisted biopsies. The variable rate of complete excision raises questions about the possibility to use BLES as a therapeutic device for the excision of small lesions. Further research should focus on this aspect of BLES.},

In addition, the clinical protocol included one pre- and five post-contrast regular T1-weighted Dixon acquisitions, ultrafast T1-weighted TWIST acquisitions during the inflow of contrast, and a T2 weighted Dixon acquisition. In total, 42 malignant (32 invasive ductal carcinomas, 4 invasive lobular carcinomas, 1 ductal carcinoma in situ and 5 other malignant lesions) and 12 benign lesions were detected on the contrast-enhanced series. Malignant lesions had a mean MRI size of 18.7 mm +- 15.1 mm (range: 3 - 92 mm) and benign lesions had a mean size of 5.9 mm +- 3.8 mm (range: 3 - 15 mm). Four dedicated breast radiologists (4 to 15 years of experience with breast MRI) independently scored both sequences for overall IQ (1: extremely poor to 9: excellent). All lesions were also independently evaluated for conspicuity (1: not visible, 2: visible if location is given, 3: visible). Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS using Generalized Linear Models and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

                             Results
                             Overall IQ was significantly higher for the conventional rs-DWI-EPI (Mean +- SD: 5.5 +- 1.9) than for the SMS-ss-DWI-EPI (Mean +- SD: 4.2 +- 2.0) (p=0.002). Lesion conspicuity scores were significantly higher for SMS-ss-DWI-EPI (p=0.009). Benign lesions had similar conspicuity with both sequences while malignant lesions had significantly higher conspicuity with SMS-ss-DWI-EPI (p=0.041) (for example, see Figure 1).
                             Infolding and ghosting artifacts were scored as disturbing or worse by 2 or more radiologists in 6 and 15 cases, for Resolve and SMS respectively. Distortion artifacts were scored as disturbing or worse in 4 and 17 cases, respectively.

  abstract = {In this era of personalized medicine, targeted immunotherapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) blocking the programmed death-1 (PD-1)/program death ligand-1 (PD-L1) axis have become an integral part of treating advanced stage non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and many other cancer types. Multiple monoclonal antibodies are available commercially to detect PD-L1 expression in tumor cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC). As most clinical trials initially required tumor biopsy for PD-L1 detection by IHC, many of the currently available PD-1/PD-L1 assays have been developed and validated on formalin fixed tissue specimens. The majority (>50%) of lung cancer cases do not have a surgical biopsy or resection specimen available for ancillary testing and instead must rely primarily on fine needle aspiration biopsy specimens for diagnosis, staging and ancillary tests. Review of the literature shows multiple studies exploring the feasibility of PD-L1 IHC on cytological samples. In addition, there are studies addressing various aspects of IHC validation on cytology preparations including pre-analytical (e.g., different fixatives), analytical (e.g., antibody clone, staining platforms, inter and intra-observer agreement, cytology-histology concordance) and post-analytical (e.g., clinical outcome) issues. Although promising results in this field have emerged utilizing cytology samples, many important questions still need to be addressed. This review summarizes the literature of PD-L1 IHC in lung cytology specimens and provides practical tips for optimizing analysis.},

  abstract = {The bedside chest radiograph represents the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis and monitoring of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Imaging findings are strongly influenced by means of mechanical ventilation therapy. The chest radiograph is relatively insensitive and not specific for the diagnosis of complications such as pneumonia or interstitial emphysema. Computed tomography (CT) is suitable for quantitative assessment of lung compartments with respect to the degree of aeration and to tissue density values. With CT, the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and the effects of ventilation therapy (PEEP) could be improved. The role of CT in the clinical routine is still limited due to the high risk to transport patients with ARDS.},

  abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) remains the main imaging technique for the preoperative staging and post-therapeutic evaluation of bronchogenic carcinoma. Spiral CT has already overcome some of the problems encountered with central or more extensive tumours. Multislice CT offers further improvement and allows for scanning of the whole chest within a single breath-hold using a thin-section high-resolution technique. Problem-adapted sections in arbitrary directions become available and provide an excellent spatial resolution. One can expect improved accuracy for the evaluation of transfissural tumour growth, chest wall involvement, mediastinal infiltration and lymph node staging. Despite recent advances in magnetic resonance (MR) techniques for imaging the chest, the role of MR for staging of bronchogenic carcinoma remains limited. It offers advantages such as the assessment of chest-wall involvement or mediastinal involvement in patients in whom CT remains equivocal. Lymph-node-specific MR contrast agents offer new diagnostic potential for the assessment of metastatic disease. New techniques for the display of three-dimensional data sets include volume rendering and virtual bronchoscopy. These techniques represent new tools for the evaluation and demonstration of pathology within the central tracheobronchial tree. Their most important application is the guidance of bronchoscopic biopsies. The assessment of an indeterminate pulmonary nodule is frequently based on positron emission tomography imaging. As an alternative, nodule vascularization (contrast enhancement patterns on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), calcifications (absorption characteristics at various X-ray energies on CT or dual energy radiography), and morphological features (high resolution imaging at CT) can be used as the basis for nodule differentiation. The dynamics of contrast enhancement in CT or MRI can also be used for the assessment of tumour viability after chemotherapy. Lung cancer screening programmes are still controversial. Low-dose computed tomography scanning and computed assisted detection algorithms based on chest radiographs or computed tomography scans form the technical basis for such projects.},

Reasons for that are the continuously improved detective or dose efficiency of the detector systems and an improved image processing. The new direct detector systems have the largest potential for dose reduction while storage phosphor and selenium radiographs are usually obtained with a dose comparable to that of a 400 speed system. Improved image processing algorithms allow for the production of digital images that are adapted to the conventional image characteristics within the lung regions combined with an increased transparency of the high absorption areas such as the retrocardial and retrodiaphragmatic regions.},

  abstract = {Substantial advances in detector technology characterize digital chest radiography. This article compares the various systems from a radiologist's point of view. Computed radiography (CR) is a well-established system that is robust, has good reproducibility, and is relatively inexpensive. Image quality has been continuously improved in recent years while the physical size of the readout units has been reduced and the throughput increased. CR is the only digital system that can be used for bedside chest radiographs. Improved detector properties and dual reading have made it a dose-efficient system. Although now widely available, a 4K image matrix does not appear to offer a general diagnostic improvement for imaging the chest. New developments with respect to detector composition and readout process can be expected in the future. Direct radiography (DR) is the common name for different technologies that are characterized by a direct readout matrix that covers the whole exposure area. Conversion of x-ray intensity into electric signals can either be direct (selenium-based systems) or indirect (scintillator/photodiode systems). Advantages of DR systems are a high image quality and the potential for dose reduction. The role of selenium radiography (Thoravision) has decreased after the advent of DR systems although this dedicated chest unit offers high image quality at 400 speed acquisition dose. Especially in a PACS environment, CR and DR systems will increasingly substitute for conventional radiography with advantages for CR for bedside chest radiographs and for DR for high-end chest stands.},

This allows for increasing of work flow efficiency and for reducing the exposure dose by about 50\% compared to current systems with a sensitivity of 400. Whether the increased dose efficiency should be used to reduce acquisition dose or to increase image quality in the chest, will be shown by further clinical experience and will be also determined by the subjective preference of the radiologists. The decreased level of image noise opens new perspectives for image processing that way that elaborated multifrequency processing allows for optimizing the display of very small and low contrast structures that was so far limited by overlying image noise. Specialized applications of dual energy subtraction and temporal subtraction will also profit by the new detector technology and will be further driven forward in context with applications such as computed assisted diagnosis even though this is currently not yet broadly applied. Storage phosphor radiography still represents an important alternative technique based on its larger flexibility with respect to equipment configuration, its broader application options in intensive care and emergency radiology and due to economic reasons. These facts are further underlined by the fact that image quality also in storage phosphor radiography could be constantly increased by improving detector technology and image processing and consequently has a high standard.},

Compared to conventional tracking schemes, its main advantage is its non-deterministic character, which strongly increases the robustness of the method. A key element of our approach is a dedicated observation model for tubular structures in regions with varying intensities. Furthermore, we show how the tracking method can be used to obtain a probabilistic segmentation of the tracked tubular structure. The method has been applied to track the internal carotid artery from CT angiography data of 14 patients (28 carotids) through the skull base. This is a challenging problem, owing to the close proximity of bone, overlap in intensity values of lumen voxels and (partial volume) bone voxels, and the tortuous path of the vessels. The tracking was successful in 25 cases, and the extracted path were found to be close (< 1.0mm) to manually traced paths by two observers.},

This editorial discusses the use of CTPA as a diagnostic tool in pregnant women and comments on the need for specifically adapting CT protocols during pregnancy in the light of new research describing a substantial number of non-diagnostic examinations in pregnant women if routine scanning protocols are used for CTA of the pulmonary arteries. Potential reasons for these high numbers of insufficient examinations are physiological changes occurring during pregnancy that lead to a hyperdynamic circulation, which reduces average enhancement of the pulmonary vasculature. In addition, there are possible breathing-related effects that include an increased risk for Valsalva manoeuvre with devastating effects for pulmonary vascular enhancement. Techniques to overcome these problems are discussed: bolus triggering with short start delays, high flow rates or high contrast medium concentration, preferential use of fast CT systems and the use of low kVp CT techniques. CT data acquisition during deep inspiration should be avoided and shallow respiration may be considered as an alternative to suspended breathing in this patient group. All these factors can contribute to optimization of the quality of pulmonary CTA in pregnant patients. It is time now to adapt our protocols and provide optimum care for this sensitive patient group.},

The eventual triumph of digital over conventional technique is related to its undoubted advantages with respect to image quality and improved image handling in the context of a picture archiving and communication system. CR represents the older system, which matured over decades and experienced some important recent improvements with respect to dose efficiency and work-flow efficiency that strengthened its position. It represents a very versatile, economically attractive system that is equally suited for integrated systems as well as for cassette-based imaging at the bedside. DR systems offer superb image quality and realistic options for dose reduction based on their high dose efficiency. While for a long time only integrated systems were on the market suited for a large patient throughput, also mobile DR systems became recently available. While for the next years, it is likely that DR and CR systems will coexist, the long term perspective of CR will depend on further innovations with respect to dose efficiency and signal-to-noise characteristics while for DR economical aspects and broader availability of mobile systems will play a role.},

  abstract = {A number of important technical advances made in recent years in the area of both digital radiography as well as multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) have improved detection and staging of bronchial carcinoma. The aim of elaborate processing such as temporal subtraction, rib suppression, dual energy subtraction or CAD is to aid the radiologist in detecting lung tumors at the earliest stage possible. For both CT and radiography techniques the differentiation between true and false positive lesions seems to be the biggest challenge. MDCT with multiplanar projections is the imaging method of choice for staging of the extent of local tumor spread (T staging), while N staging and M staging are the domain of positron emission tomography (PET) or even better of integrated PET/CT. Management rules for follow-up of solid and semi-solid lesions seen in CT consider the risks of the patient and are summarized in international guidelines. In 2009 a new 7th edition of the TNM classification was published, which, among other aspects, sub-classifies tumor size more specifically and the presence of a satellite nodule in the tumor lobe is down-staged to T3 and no longer determines tumor resectability. The N staging was not modified. One of the most important new features is the fact that the new classification no longer applies only to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but also to SCLC and carcinoid tumors.},

Posteroanterior and lateral digital chest radiographs of 108 patients with a CT proven solitary nodule, and 192 controls were read by 5 radiologists and 3 residents. Conspicuity of nodules on the radiographs was classified in four categories: obvious (n=32), moderate (n=32), subtle (n=28) and very subtle (n=16). Commercially available software (ClearRead Bone Suppression 2.4, formerly Softview, Riverain Medical, Miamisburg, Ohio) was used to generate bone suppressed images (BSI) of the PA radiographs. Observers read the PA and lateral chest radiographs without and with the availability of BSI. Anatomic locations of suspicion and confidence scores were digitally recorded. Multi reader multi case (MRMC) receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were used for statistical analysis: partial area under the curve using a clinically acceptable specificity between 80 and 100% served as the figure of merit. RESULTS. Average age was 64.8 years for nodule patients and 63.5 years for controls. Average nodule size was 17.5mm (median 17mm). ROC analysis showed improved detection with use of bone suppression imaging compared to chest radiographs alone (p= 0.008). Operating at a specificity of 90%, lung nodule detection sensitivity increased from 67% without BSI to 72% with BSI. Increase of detection performance was highest for moderate and subtle nodules with 11% (66% vs. 73%). Two of 8 nodules that were not reported by any of the observers with CXR alone, were seen by at least 4 observers with BSI.CONCLUSION.

We investigated the effect of an improved CAD system on nodule detection performance in CXR with the additional availability of bone suppression images (BSI). METHOD AND MATERIALS. Five radiologists and 3 residents served as observers and were asked to separately score location and confidence score for the detection of nodules in CXR without (mode A) and with the availability of CAD candidates (mode B). The study group consisted of 108 PA and lateral CXRs with a CT proven solitary pulmonary nodule and 192 age-matched CT proven negative controls. For both reading modes readers had BSI available. CAD marks and BSI were created by a commercially available software package (ClearRead +Detect 5.2, formerly Onguard 5.2; ClearRead Bone Suppression 2.4, formerly Softview 2.4, Riverain Medical, Miamisburg, Ohio). Multi reader multi case (MRMC) Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were used for statistical analysis: partial area under the curve, at a specificity interval of 80-100% served as figure of merit. RESULTS. Average nodule size was 17.5mm (7-36mm), with a malignancy rate of 83%. Standalone CAD performance was 74% with 1.0 FP/image. Observer performance significantly increased with the use of CAD and outperformed CXR with use of BSI (p=0.047). Mean sensitivity of the observers was 74% with 0.25 FP/image without CAD and 80% with 0.33 FP/image with CAD. Operating at a specificity of 90%, lung nodule detection sensitivity increased from 70.3% with CXR and BSI to 73.0% with additional availability of CAD. On average 10.5% of all true positive CAD marks were rejected by the radiologists, indicating potential for further improvement with the use of CAD. CONCLUSION. Even with bone suppressed images available, computer aided detection shows additional value in lung nodule detection for radiologists.},

  abstract = {Lung cancer is frequently overlooked in chest radiographs (CXR), often caused by overprojection of bone structures in the image. Bone suppression imaging (BSI) techniques could improve detection and interpretation of lung nodules. We investigated the effect of a new software product (Clearread BSI 2.4, Riverain Medical Group, Miamisburg, Ohio) that suppresses ribs and clavicles, on the detection of lung nodules. Eight observers, including five radiologists and three residents assessed radiographs of 111 patients with a CT proven solitary nodule and 189 controls. In a fully crossed study design observers assessed first radiographs without and with BSI sequentially. Secondly they scored radiographs independently having BSI available from the beginning. Five months later, the same readers scored the same cases again in an independent reading session, completing the three scorings for CXRs with BSI. Multi reader multi case (MRMC) receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were used for statistical analysis. DBM variance component estimates were calculated. Reading times were digitally recorded. Observer achieved a mean area under the curve (AUC) for unaided reading of 0.855. AUC increased to 0.883(p=0.002) with BSI in the sequential reading mode and to 0.874 (p=0.21) in the independent reading mode. In the second independent reading session after five months the AUC was 0.882 (p=0.20). Median reading times were 19s per case for the unaided CXR with another 10s for reading BSI sequentially. For the independent modes reading times were 19s and 18s. Total observer variance between sequential and independent reading design remained the same. A strong increase of uncorrelated components was found in the independent reading sessions, masking the ability to demonstrate differences in observer performance across modalities. In conclusion, bone suppression imaging improves lung nodule detection in CXR and does not prolong reading time. The independent study design has little power compared to the sequential study design due to a strong increase of uncorrelated variance components.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the added value of computer aided detection to bone suppression imaging on observer performance in detecting lung nodules in chest radiographs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Posteroanterior (PA) and lateral digital chest radiographs of 111 (average age 65; m:f 66:45) patients with a CT proven solitary nodule (median diameter 15mm), and 189 (average age 63; m:f 111:78) controls were read by 6 radiologists and 6 residents. Institutional review board approval was obtained. Observers read the PA and lateral chest radiographs without and with Computer Aided Detection (CAD) (ClearRead +Detect 5.2, Riverain Technologies, Miamisburg, Ohio) within one reading session, and provided locations with scores of suspicion for the presence of a nodule. CAD marks were displayed as lesion contours and accompanied by a likelihood of suspiciousness. Bone suppressed images (BSI) (ClearRead Bone Suppresion 2.4, Riverain Technologies, Miamisburg, Ohio) were available at all time. Multi reader multi case (MRMC) localization receiver operating characteristics (AFROC) were used for statistical analysis. Besides, reader scores and CAD scores were independently combined, only using the reader mark locations. Significance of difference was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: Sensitivity of the CAD system was 74% at 1.0 FP/image. LROC analysis showed improved detection with use of BSI plus CAD compared to chest radiographs with BSI (AUC = 0.848 versus 0.858; p= 0.02). Operating at a specificity of 90%, sensitivity increased with CAD from 66% to 69% (p=0.005). An independent combination of reader with CAD showed an AUC of 0.857 and a sensitivity of 70% at a specificity of 90%. CAD detected 148 of the 313 nodules initially missed by the observers. CONCLUSION: Computer aided detection showed added value to bone suppressed images for the detection of lung nodules in chest radiographs. CAD was able to detect 47% of the nodules missed by the observers. Independent combination of reader with CAD showed similar performance as when CAD was used as a second reader.},

  booktitle = {MIPS},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: To investigate new methods of using a computer aided detection (CAD) system for the detection of lung nodules in chest radiographs. CAD systems for the detection of lung nodules may be clinically used but their standalone performance is still low in comparison with radiologists. Since CAD is limited by relatively high false positive rates, the way these systems are currently used may not be optimal. In our study we investigate two alternatives: Use of CAD as interactive decision support and CAD as an independent second reader. METHODS: We selected 300 frontal and lateral digital chest radiographs, including 111 with a solitary pulmonary nodule. All chest radiographs were analyzed by a commercially available CAD system (ClearRead +Detect 5.2, Riverain Technologies, Miamisburg, Ohio) which provided lesion contours of suspicious regions, accompanied by a probability score. The CAD system was used in an interactive manner. CAD marks and their suspiciousness score remained hidden unless their location was queried by the radiologist. Twelve radiologists read the CXRs without CAD and with the interactive CAD in two reading sessions. AFROC MRMC analysis was used to measure detection performance. Partial areas under the curve in a FPF range between 0 and 0.2 were used to compare reader performance. Besides, results of a weighted independent combination of CAD scores and reader scores, at the location of reader findings, were evaluated. RESULTS: Average partial area under the curve for radiologists without CAD was 0.127. No improvement was seen for radiologists with use of the interactive CAD (pAUC=0.127, p=0.88). Independent combination of reader scores with CAD significantly improved performance (pAUC=0.135,p=0.007). CONCLUSION: Though interactive use of CAD did not improve reader performance for the detection of lung nodules in chest radiographs, CAD has potential as decision support, since a simple weighted combination of reader scores with CAD scores significantly improved performance. Lack of confidence in CAD in the interactive sessions may explain these results.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The detection performance for lung nodules in chest radiography shows a large interreader variability. High miss rates of lung cancer have been reported though judged as being visible in retrospect. History has proven that computer intelligence is able to surpass human performance also for complex tasks (e.g., Watson). Purpose of our study was to explore the potential gain in performance by independent combination of multiple observers. That way we aimed to define the upper boundary of "visual" detectability that ideally should be achieved by a computer aided detection (CAD) system. METHODS: 111 digital chest radiographs (CXR) containing a single small nodule (average diameter 16mm.) and 189 normal controls served as study group. Nodules had to be visible on the frontal radiograph with 42% of them judged as being of low and very low conspicuity. Twelve observers were asked to localize the lung nodules in the CXRs with help of bone suppressed images. Location based ROC was used for analysis. Mean sensitivity in a false positive fraction range between 0 and 0.2 was used to measure nodule localization performance. This was done for all observers separately and subsequently for the combination of multiple observers (up to 12). Observer findings were averaged when findings were located within 1.5 cm of each other. When no finding was present at the location of another observersA-A?A 1/2  finding a zero-score was assigned in the averaging calculation. RESULTS: The mean sensitivity at a false positive fraction range between 0 and 0.2 was 64.0% for single reading (range 45.5% - 78.2%). Combining the readings of two observers improved lung nodule detection on average to a mean sensitivity of 73.1%. Adding more observers lead to a further performance increase up to a mean sensitivity for 12 observers of 82.3%. On average, 26 nodules were missed by single observers, 15 nodules by a combination of 2 observers, and only 5 nodules were missed when combining 12 observers. CONCLUSION: The variable and partially low baseline performance underlines the limitation of the "single observer". If CAD is able to reach the combined performance of multiple readers, a dramatic increase of nodule localization performance can be expected with drastic reduction of missed rates.},

  abstract = {Digital chest radiography is still the most common radiological examination. With the upcoming three-dimensional (3D) acquisition techniques the value of radiography seems to diminish. But because radiography is inexpensive, readily available, and requires very little dose, it is still being used for the first-line detection of many cardiothoracic diseases. In the last decades major technical developments of this 2D technique are being achieved. First, hardware developments of digital radiography have improved the contrast to noise, dose efficacy, throughput, and workflow. Dual energy acquisition techniques reduce anatomical noise by splitting a chest radiograph into a soft tissue image and a bone image. Second, advanced processing methods are developed to enable and improve detection of many kinds of disease. Digital bone subtraction by a software algorithm mimics the soft tissue image normally acquired with dedicated hardware. Temporal subtraction aims to rule out anatomical structures clotting the image, by subtracting a current radiograph with a previous radiograph. Finally, computer-aided detection systems help radiologists for the detection of various kinds of disease such as pulmonary nodules or tuberculosis.},

Both nodule and control cases were verified by CT. Six radiologists and six residents reviewed the chest radiographs without CAD and with CAD (ClearRead +DetectAC/aEURzAC/ 5.2; Riverain Technologies, Miamisburg, OH) in two reading sessions.

Conclusion: Interactive CAD did not improve reader performance for the detection of lung nodules on chest radiographs. Independent combination of reader and CAD scores improved the detection performance of lung nodules. Advances in knowledge: (1) Interactive use of currently available CAD software did not improve the radiologists' detection performance of lung nodules on chest radiographs.

The results of the largest European trial NELSON are expected within the next 2 years. In addition, there are a number of open or not yet satisfactorily answered questions, such as the definition of the appropriate screening population, the management of nodules detected by screening, the effects of over-diagnosis and the risk of cumulative radiation exposure.The success of the NLST prompted several predominantly American professional societies to issue a positive recommendation about the implementation of lung cancer screening in a population at risk. However, potentially conflicting results of European studies and a number of not yet optimized issues justify caution and call for a pooled analysis of European studies in order to provide statistically sound results and to ensure a high efficiency of screening with respect to the radiation applied, mental and physical patient burden and, last but not least, the financial efforts.},

We investigated the effect of the sequential and independent reading design on observer study results with respect to reader performance and their statistical power. For this we performed an observer study for the detection of lung nodules with bone-suppressed images (BSIs) compared with original chest radiographs. In a fully crossed observer study, eight observers assessed a series of 300 radiographs four times, including one assessment of the original radiograph with sequential BSI and two independent reading sessions with BSI. Observer performance was compared using multireader multicase receiver operating characteristics. No significant difference between the effect of BSI in the sequential and the independent reading sessions could be found (p=0.09; p=0.46). Compared with the original radiographs, increased performance with BSI was significant in the sequential and one of the independent reading sessions (p<0.0001; p=0.0007), and nonsignificant in the other independent reading session (p=0.10). A strong increase of uncorrelated variance components was found in the independent reading sessions, masking the ability to demonstrate differences in observer performance across modalities. Therefore, the sequential reading design is the preferred design because it is less burdensome and has more statistical power.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To assess the effect of bone suppression images on observer performance in detecting pulmonary fungal infections (PFI) on chest radiographs. Materials and Methods: 105 frontal (bedside or PA) chest radiographs (CXR) of suspects for PFI were collected from four institutions. Presence or absence of disease was determined by an expert radiologist and a clinical researcher in consensus, using CT as reference standard. Radiographs could contain single or multiple sites of infection, and were classified into four categories of subtlety. Bone suppressed images (BSI) were generated by ClearRead BSI 3.2 (Riverain Technologies, Ohio). Five radiologists and two residents participated in an observer study. Evaluation was done on a per lung basis, resulting in 78 diseased lungs and 132 normal lungs. Observers scored the lungs on a continuous scale (0-100), and marked the most suspicious lesion, if present. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) served as performance measure. P-values were calculated using the Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz method. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated considering only the lungs with a suspiciousness score over 50 to be positive. Results: AUC without BSI was 0.815, and increased to 0.853 with BSI (p=0.01). Six of the seven observers increased their performance, four of them significantly. Sensitivity increased from 49% to 66%. Specificity dropped from 95% to 90%. Significant improvement of performance was seen in the group of very subtle cases (p<0.001). Conclusion: BSI significantly improved detection performance of PFI in chest radiographs, especially for very subtle abnormalities. BSI improved the sensitivity of the CXR examination, outweighing the smaller loss in specificity.},

Methods: We selected 300 posteroanterior and lateral digital chest radiographs(CXR), including 111 with a solitary CT proven pulmonary nodule with an average diameter of 16mm. Twelve radiologists read the CXRs having bone suppressed images available. Readers marked and scored suspicious regions on a continuous scale from 0 to 100. All images were also processed by a CAD system (ClearRead+Detect 5.2, Riverain Technologies) that also provided a score between 0 and 100 for each suspicious location it identified. Location based ROC analysis was used to measure nodule localization performance. Mean sensitivity in a false positive fraction range between 0 and 0.2 was used to compare reader performance. Double reading was evaluated by combining the findings of two readers: scores of findings at the same location were averaged while findings that were not identified by the second observer were averaged with 0. CAD results were treated similar as every observer for simulated double reading. A paired t-test was used to calculate differences. Results: The mean sensitivity was 64.0% for single reading (range 45.5%-78.2%). Combining the readings of two observers improved lung nodule detection on average to 73.1% (range 58.3%-83.8%; p=0.001). Performance with CAD as the second reader increased to 67.8% (range 58.1%-81.1%; p=0.02).

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of bone-suppressed chest radiographs on the detection of common chest abnormalities.A total of 261 posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs were collected from 2 hospitals. Radiographs could contain single or multiple focal opacities <3 cm (n=66), single or multiple focal opacities >3 cm (n=33), diffuse lung disease (n=49), signs of cardiogenic congestion (n=26), or no abnormalities (n=110). Twenty-one cases contained >1 type of disease. All abnormalities were confirmed by a computed tomographic scan obtained within 4 weeks of the radiograph. Bone-suppressed images (BSIs) were generated from every posteroanterior radiograph (ClearRead BSI 3.2). All cases were read by 6 radiologists without BSI, followed by an evaluation of the same case with BSI. Presence or absence of each disease category and confidence (0-100) of the observers were documented for each interpretation. Differences in the number of correct detections without and with BSI were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.On average, 6 more cases with focal lesions were correctly identified with BSI (P=0.03), and 1 additional case with diffuse abnormalities was found with BSI (P=0.32). None of the observers demonstrated a decrease in the number of correctly detected cases with diffuse abnormalities or cardiogenic congestion with BSI. False positives in normal cases with availability of BSI mainly referred to the detection of small focal lesions (on average 7 per reader; P=0.04).BSI does not negatively affect the interpretation of diffuse lung disease, while improving visualization of focal lesions on chest radiographs. BSI leads to overcalling of focal abnormalities in normal radiographs.},

  abstract = {Background The prognosis of hospitalized patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is difficult to predict, while the capacity of intensive care units (ICUs) is a limiting factor during the peak of the pandemic and generally dependent on a country's clinical resources. Purpose To determine the value of chest radiographic findings together with patient history and laboratory markers at admission to predict critical illness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Material and Methods In this retrospective study including patients from 7th March 2020 to 24  April 2020, a consecutive cohort of hospitalized patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from two large Dutch community hospitals was identified. After univariable analysis, a risk model to predict critical illness (i.e. death and/or ICU admission with invasive ventilation) was developed, using multivariable logistic regression including clinical, CXR and laboratory findings. Distribution and severity of lung involvement was visually assessed using an 8-point scale (chest radiography score). Internal validation was performed using bootstrapping. Performance is presented as an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Decision curve analysis was performed, and a risk calculator was derived. Results The cohort included 356 hospitalized patients (69 +-12 years, 237 male) of whom 168 (47%) developed critical illness. The final risk model's variables included gender, chronic obstructive lung disease, symptom duration, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein level, lactate dehydrogenase level, distribution of lung disease and chest radiography score at hospital presentation. The AUC of the model was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.72-0.81, P < .001). A risk calculator was derived for individual risk assessment; Dutch COVID-19 risk model (see Appendix E2). At an example threshold of 0.70, 71 of 356 patients would be predicted to develop critical illness of which 59 (83%) would be true-positives. Conclusion A risk model based on chest radiographic and laboratory findings obtained at admission was predictive of critical illness in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. This risk calculator might be useful for triage of patients to the limited number of ICU beds/facilities.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score is commonly used in clinical practice and research to monitor disease severity and determine treatment efficacy. Automating the PASI score with deep learning algorithms, like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), could enable objective and efficient PASI scoring. Objectives To assess the performance of image-based automated PASI scoring in anatomical regions by CNNs and compare the performance of CNNs to image-based scoring by physicians. Methods Imaging series were matched to PASI subscores determined in real life by the treating physician. CNNs were trained using standardized imaging series of 576 trunk, 614 arm and 541 leg regions. CNNs were separately trained for each PASI subscore (erythema, desquamation, induration and area) in each anatomical region (trunk, arms and legs). The head region was excluded for anonymity. Additionally, PASI-trained physicians retrospectively determined image-based subscores on the test set images of the trunk. Agreement with the real-life scores was determined with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and compared between the CNNs and physicians. Results Intraclass correlation coefficients between the CNN and real-life scores of the trunk region were 0.616, 0.580, 0.580 and 0.793 for erythema, desquamation, induration and area, respectively, with similar results for the arms and legs region. PASI-trained physicians (N = 5) were in moderate-good agreement (ICCs 0.706-0.793) with each other for image-based PASI scoring of the trunk region. ICCs between the CNN and real-life scores were slightly higher for erythema (0.616 vs. 0.558), induration (0.580 vs. 0.573) and area scoring (0.793 vs. 0.694) than image-based scoring by physicians. Physicians slightly outperformed the CNN on desquamation scoring (0.580 vs. 0.589). Conclusions Convolutional Neural Networks have the potential to automatically and objectively perform image-based PASI scoring at an anatomical region level. For erythema, desquamation and induration scoring, CNNs performed similar to physicians, while for area scoring CNNs outperformed physicians on image-based PASI scoring.},

  abstract = {There is a growing number of drugs with lung toxicity, and radiologists are increasingly confronted with nonspecific patterns of possibly drug-induced lung disease. The present article reviews clinical symptoms, pathological findings and radiographic features associated with drugs causing lung disease. Roentgen-morphological categorization is based on the predominant pattern and distinguishes five groups of drugs that cause interstitial opacities, air space consolidation, mixed interstitial and consolidating opacities, pulmonary edema and alterations associated with pulmonary vessels. Clinical, pathological and radiological findings are nonspecific in the majority of cases, and clinicians and radiologists can only hope to assess the probability of drug-induced lung disease by correlating radiographic and clinical data. Useful clinical data include respiratory symptoms, results of respiratory function tests, dose and schedule of drug administration, and information concerning concomitant or previous administration of drugs or radiation therapy. Useful radiographic data include the distribution of densities seen on the chest radiograph, the presence or absence of thoracic adenopathy and pleural effusion. Drug-induced lung disease frequently simulates disseminated opportunistic infections (particularly pneumocystis carinii) and must be differentiated from these because the treatment is completely different. Since early recognition and withdrawal of the noxious agent constitute the best treatment for drug-induced disease, the physician's alertness to drug toxicity is most important.},

Digital radiographs were laser-printed in a full-size conventional format and in image lengths of two-thirds, one-half, and five-elevenths of the conventional format. Eighteen thousand observations by eight radiologists were analyzed by use of receiver operating characteristics. The detectability of lines and micronodular opacities decreased with declining image format size. In the detection of micronodular opacities, only the nearly full-size digital images were equivalent to conventional images. In the detection of linear opacities, reduction of image length by one-half or more reduced performance (analysis of variance, P less than .05).

Detection performance of 10 radiologists was compared by using a multireader-multicase receiver operating characteristic analysis of variance.For the detection of nodules, no statistically significant differences between imaging modes were seen. For the detection of micronodules and linear lesions, both selenium techniques were superior to all other modes (P < .05). In addition, the asymmetric screen-film radiographs were inferior (P < .05) to the conventional screen-film radiographs and to storage phosphor radiographs for the detection of micronodules.The selenium detector improves detection of simulated fine linear and low-contrast micronodular details and appears to be superior to other detector systems for chest radiography.},

  abstract = {For the detection of microcalcifications in mammograms, accurate noise estimation is of crucial importance. In this paper we present a method that makes a robust estimate of the signal dependent image noise, by taking into account quantum noise and detector inhomogeneity. In digital mammograms, high frequency image noise is dominated by quantum noise, which in raw images can be described by a square root model where the noise is proportional to the pixel value. However, due to detector inhomogeneity, the anode heel effect and other sources of variation, noise properties vary across an image. We developed a method that deals with these effects in a general way, by making a nonuniform noise model that is pixel value and location dependent. This is established by subdividing the image into tiles. In each tile a square root model of the noise is estimated, that by interpolation gives a model of the noise as a function of pixel value and location. Results indicate some improvement in microcalcification detection, when this model is used to estimate noise in images acquired with an inhomogeneous detector.},

  abstract = {For the detection of microcalcifications, accurate noise estimation has shown to be an important step. In tomosynthesis, noise models have been proposed for projection data. However, it is expected that manufacturers of tomosynthesis systems will not store the raw projection images, but only the reconstructed volumes. We therefore investigated if and how signal dependent image noise can be modelled in the reconstructed volumes. For this research we used a dataset of 41 tomosynthesis volumes, of which 12 volumes contained a total of 20 microcalcification clusters. All volumes were acquired with a prototype of {S}ectra's photon-counting tomosynthesis system. Preliminary results show that image noise is signal dependent in a reconstructed volume, and that a model of this noise can be estimated from a volume at hand. Evaluation of the noise model was performed by using a basic microcalcification cluster detection algorithm that classifies voxels by using a threshold on a local contrast filter. Image noise was normalized by dividing local contrast in a voxel by the standard deviation of the estimated image noise in that voxel. {FROC} analysis shows that performance increases strongly, when we use our model to correct for signal dependent image noise in reconstructed volumes.},

  abstract = {In the development of a computer-aided detection ({CAD}) system a large database of training samples is of major importance. However digital breast tomosynthesis ({DBT}) is a relatively new modality and no large database of cases is available yet. To overcome this limitation we are developing a {CAD} system for mass detection in {DBT} that can be trained with regular 2{D} mammograms, for which large datasets are available. We trained our system with a very large database of screen-film mammograms ({SFM}). Our approach does not use projection images, but only reconstructed volumes, because it is expected that manufacturers of tomosynthesis systems will only store the reconstructed volumes. In this study we developed a method that converts reconstructed volumes into a series of {SFM}-like slices and combinations of slices, called slabs. By combining slices into slabs, more information of a whole mass, which usually spans several slices, is used and its appearance becomes more similar to a 2{D} mammogram. In this study we investigate the effect of using slabs of different sizes on the performance of our {CAD} system. For validation we use a dataset of 63 tomosynthesis cases (245 volumes) consisting of 42 normal cases (163 volumes) and 21 abnormal cases (82 volumes) with a total of 47 malignant masses and architectural distortions. The volumes are acquired with a tomosynthesis system from {S}ectra and are reconstructed into 0.3 cm thick slices. Results show that performance of our {CAD} system increases significantly when slices are combined into larger slabs. Best performance is obtained when a slab thickness of 1.5 cm (5 slices) is used, which is significantly higher than using slabs of a single slice, two slices and all slices.},

In digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), finding corresponding regions in ipsilateral volumes may be a difficult and time-consuming task for radiologists, because many slices have to be inspected individually. In this study we developed a method to quickly estimate corresponding locations in ipsilateral tomosynthesis views by applying a mathematical transformation. First a compressed breast model is matched to the tomosynthesis view containing a point of interest. Then we decompress, rotate and compress again to estimate the location of the corresponding point in the ipsilateral view. In this study we use a simple elastically deformable sphere model to obtain an analytical solution for the transformation in a given DBT case. The model is matched to the volume by using automatic segmentation of the pectoral muscle, breast tissue and nipple. For validation we annotated 181 landmarks in both views and applied our method to each location.

For validation, we annotated 208 landmarks in both views of a total of 146 imaged breasts of 109 different patients and applied our method to each location. The best results are obtained by using the centre of gravity of the breast to define the central axis of the model, around which the breast is assumed to rotate between views. Results show a median 3D distance between the actual location and the estimated location of 14.6 mm, a good starting point for a registration method or a feature-based local search method to link suspicious regions in a multiview CAD system. Approximately half of the estimated locations are at most one slice away from the actual location, which makes the method useful as a mammographic workstation tool for radiologists to interactively find corresponding locations in ipsilateral tomosynthesis views.},

  abstract = {Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a promising 3D modality that may replace mammography in the future. However, lesion search is likely to require more time in DBT volumes, while comparisons between views from different projections and prior exams might be harder to make. This may make screening with DBT cumbersome. A solution may be provided by synthesizing 2D mammograms from DBT, which may then be used to guide the search for abnormalities. In this work we focus on synthesizing mammograms in which masses and architectural distortions are optimally visualized. Our approach first determines relevant points in a DBT volume with a computer-aided detection system and then renders a mammogram from the intersection of a surface fitted through these points and the DBT volume. The method was evaluated in a pilot observer study where three readers reported mass findings in 87 patients (25 malignant, 62 normal) for which both DBT and digital mammograms were available. We found that on average, diagnostic accuracy in the synthetic mammograms was higher (Az=0.85) than in conventional mammograms (Az=0.81), although the difference was not statistically significant. Preliminary results suggest that the synthesized mammograms are an acceptable alternative for real mammograms regarding the detection of mass lesions.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) system for masses in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) which can make use of an existing CAD system for detection of breast masses in full-field digital mammography (FFDM). This approach has the advantage that large digital screening databases that are becoming available can be used for training. DBT is currently not used for screening which makes it hard to obtain sufficient data for training.Methods: The proposed CAD system is applied to reconstructed DBT volumes and consists of two stages. In the first stage, an existing 2D CAD system is applied to slabs composed of multiple DBT slices, after processing the slabs to a representation similar to that of the FFDM training data. In the second stage, the authors group detections obtained in the slabs that detect the same object and determine the 3D location of the grouped findings using one of three different approaches, including one that uses a set of features extracted from the DBT slabs. Experiments were conducted to determine performance of the CAD system, the optimal slab thickness for this approach and the best method to establish the 3D location. Experiments were performed using a database of 192 patients (752 DBT volumes). In 49 patients, one or more malignancies were present which were described as a mass, architectural distortion, or asymmetry. Free response receiver operating characteristic analysis and bootstrapping were used for statistical evaluation.Results: Best performance was obtained when slab thickness was in the range of 1-2 cm. Using the feature based 3D localization procedure developed in the study, accurate 3D localization could be obtained in most cases. Case sensitivities of 80\% and 90\% were achieved at 0.35 and 0.99 false positives per volume, respectively.Conclusions: This study indicates that there may be a large benefit in using 2D mammograms for the development of CAD for DBT and that there is no need to exclusively limit development to DBT data.},

  abstract = {{PURPOSE} Pathological changes of the airways are strongly associated with lung function impairment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}). A system for automatic quantification of airway dimensions in chest {CT} scans is presented and its performance is validated. {METHOD AND MATERIALS} For this study, 1113 full inspiration low dose chest {CT} scans (16x0.75mm, 120-140{kVp}, 30{mAs}) of male participants of a lung cancer screening trial were processed automatically. Processing starts with detection of the trachea and segmentation of the airway tree based on region growing and morphological processing. The airway segmentation is converted to a centerline-model and the 5 lobes are classified by searching for maximal subtrees in terms of volume and separation of barycenters. Cross-section image planes oriented perpendicular to the local airway direction are defined at a spacing of 1mm throughout the entire airway tree. For each of them, intensity profiles of 72 rays pointing from the center point outwards are analyzed using an intensity integration technique, which accounts for partial volume effects and allows for accurate determination of inner and outer wall boundaries. Lumen diameter and area, wall thickness and area, relative wall area and lumen perimeter are calculated per cross-section. Branching areas and positions where the detection of the boundaries failed are automatically excluded from further analysis. For each scan, an experienced radiologist was asked to accept or reject the measurements based on structured reports showing a model of the airway tree with the classified lobes and a representative selection of up to 98 airway cross-sections and the detected inner and outer wall boundaries. The reliability of the system was determined based on the overall acceptance ratio and the occurence of different processing errors that lead to a rejection of measurements. {RESULTS} The measurements in 1042 cases (93.6%) were rated as excellent by an experienced radiologist. The remaining cases were rejected due to problems with the trachea detection (0.7%), airway segmentation (2.6%), lobe classification (1.8%) or other reasons (1.3%). {CONCLUSION} Automatic quantification of airway dimensions in large chest {CT} scan databases is feasible with a high success rate.},

  abstract = {{PURPOSE} Previous studies investigated the relation of emphysema and air trapping measurements to {COPD} {GOLD} stages. This study investigates the additional value of airway wall thickness measurements in inspiration chest {CT} scans. {METHOD AND MATERIALS} A database of low-dose chest {CT} scans of control subjects ({GOLD} 0, n=44) and {COPD} subjects ({GOLD} {I-IV}, n=45/44/41/34) was used. In house developed software (Fraunhofer MEVIS, Bremen, Germany; Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Nijmegen, the Netherlands) automatically segmented the lungs and airways in both the inspiration and expiration scans. Airway wall thickness was assessed in orthogonal cross-sections every 1mm throughout the entire airway tree (inspiration only) using an intensity-integration technique which accounts for partial volume effects. Wall thickness was averaged across all cross-sections with a lumen diameter of 2.75-3.25mm ({WT3}). Emphysema was determined as the percentage of lung volume below -950 HU in inspiration scans ({IN}-950), air trapping was determined as the percentage of lung volume below -850 HU in expiration scans ({EX}-850). Multiple linear regression models for different combinations of {CT} measurements ({IN}-950, {EX}-850, {WT3}, {IN}-950 & {EX}-850, {IN}-950 & {WT3}, {IN}-950 & {EX}-850 & {WT3}) as input variables and numeric {GOLD} stage (integer number 0-4) as output variable were established and compared to each other in terms of adjusted squared correlation coefficient R2 between output of the regression model and true {GOLD} stages. {RESULTS} The overall highest correlation was observed for the combination of all three measurements as input variables with adjusted R2=0.72, closely followed by R2=0.69 for the combination of inspiration only measurements {IN}-950 and {WT3}. Lower values were observed for all remaining models ({IN}-950 & {EX}-850: 0.64 / {EX}-850: 0.64 / {IN}-950: 0.53 / {WT3}: 0.23). {CONCLUSION} The combination of airway wall thickness and emphysema measurements from only inspiration {CT} scans provides more information for the prediction of lung function as determined by {GOLD} stages than combination of emphysema and air trapping measurements in inspiration and expiration {CT} scans. {CL{IN}ICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION} Airway wall thickness measurements contribute valuable information for the prediction of lung function from chest {CT} scans and may provide additional insight into development of {COPD}.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Pathological changes of the airways are strongly associated with lung function impairment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}). We investigate the reproducibility of {CT}-based airway dimension measurements and their dependence on the level of inspiration. METHOD AND MATERIALS We analyzed 740 pairs of low-dose chest {CT} scans of male (former) smokers who were recalled for a three month follow up scan in the {NELSON} lung cancer screening trial. Given the slow progression of {COPD}, we expect that no significant {COPD}-related changes in airway dimensions should exist between baseline and three month follow-up. Each scan was analyzed fully automatic using {CIRRUS} Lung 13.03 and airway wall thickness (Pi10) and lung volume were recorded. Subjects where processing failed for any of the two scans were excluded for analysis (n=32). First, we analyzed the differences in airway wall thickness measurements for all scan pairs. Next, we determined reproducibility in absence of significant changes in inspiration depth by repeating the analysis for the subset of scans where the difference in lung volume between baseline and follow-up was less than 200ml (n=312). Finally, we investigated the correlation between difference in inspiration depth and airway wall thickness measurements, established a linear correction model for the airway measurements and analyzed differences for corrected measurements. RESULTS Average Pi10 measurements for all 708 scan pairs were 2.46A,A+-0.55mm (range 1.09-4.33mm). Median (95th percentile) absolute difference between baseline and follow-up Pi10 measurements in all 708 scan pairs was 0.13mm (0.53mm), median lung volume differences were 230ml (1050ml). In scan pairs with well reproduced depth of inspiration (AZaEUR?Vol < 200ml, n=312), median absolute Pi10 difference was 0.10mm (0.38mm). Relative differences in lung volume and Pi10 measurements were highly correlated (r=-0.64, p<0.001). After correction for lung volume changes, absolute measurement difference was 0.11mm (0.40mm). CONCLUSION Changes in level of inspiration are significantly associated to changes of airway wall thickness and accounted for approximately 25% of the total differences between baseline and follow-up measurements. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Inspiration depth should be controlled or linear correction should be applied for monitoring of airway wall thickness. This may help to better differentiate {COPD} subtypes in chest {CT} scans.},

  title = {Subvoxel Accurate Airway Wall Measurements using an Intensity Integration Approach: Comparative Study using the {COPDGene} Phantom},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {PURPOSE Accurate quantification of airway wall thickness in thoracic CT is a key technique for the extraction of imaging biomarkers in obstructive pulmonary disease. We present an intensity integration approach that allows measurements of airway wall thickness with an accuracy higher than the resolution of the CT data. METHOD AND MATERIALS For most airways visible on CT, wall thickness is less than the resolution of the image data and partial volume effects hamper accurate measurement. By making appropriate assumptions about the density of air, airway wall and lung parenchyma, it is possible to fit a model to an array of line profiles perpendicular to the airway wall and thus measure the wall thickness precisely. This intensity integration approach was compared with two established methods: Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum (FWHM) and Phase Congruency (PC). We used the improved COPDGene phantom with 7 polycarbonate tubes with varying sizes (lumen diameter: 2.5/3/3/6/6/6/6 mm, wall thickness: 0.4/0.6/0.6/0.9/1.2/1.2/1.5 mm) and orientations (tubes 3 and 6 at 30A,Adeg angle from scanner z-axis, all others in z-axis direction). The intensity integration and FWHM method were implemented by the authors, PC measurements were obtained using the open source software Airway Inspector. We measured each tube at five positions and calculated the average measurement. Accuracy of each method was determined by calculating the minimum, mean and maximum signed as well as mean unsigned measurement errors for each method. Additionally, linear regression was used to determine each methodAC/a,!a,,C/s ability to detect changes in wall thickness regardless of constant measurement bias. RESULTS The smallest minimum/mean/maximum signed errors were obtained for intensity integration: -0.07/-0.01/0.05 mm versus 0.39/0.74/1.04 mm (FWHM) and -0.26/0.13/0.57 mm (PC). Intensity integration also gave the lowest mean absolute errors: 0.05 mm versus 0.74mm (FWHM) and 0.27mm (PC). Correlation was very high for intensity integration and FWHM (r=0.997 and r=0.972, both p<0.001) and only high for PC (r=0.746, p=0.054). CONCLUSION Intensity integration yielded the superior results in terms of overall error and measurement consistency. FWHM significantly overestimates thin walls but provides consistent measurements. PC is unreliable for measuring small airways. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Airway wall thickness measurements are best performed with an intensity integration quantification algorithm.},

Exclusion criteria were patients with suspicion of prostate cancer recurrence after therapy, and biopsy specimens which could not be categorized within the following histopathological groups: normal prostate tissue, prostatitis and prostate cancer. During the biopsy procedure, an axial diffusion-weighted sequence was acquired with construction of ADC maps (TR/TE, 2000/67 ms; section thickness of 4 mm; in-plane resolution, 1.8 x 1.8 mm and b-values of 0, 100, 500 and 800 s/mm2). To verify the biopsy location, a confirmation scan with the needle left in situ was acquired. This confirmation scan was projected on the calculated ADC map in order to draw a region-of-interest (ROI) on the ADC map, representing the biopsied CSR. The obtained ADC-values of this ROI were compared with the histological outcomes of the biopsy specimens. A one-way ANOVA with post-hoc comparison was used to test for ADC-value differences among the three histological groups. Differences were considered to be significant at p<.05. {RESULTS} In total 85 out of 130 patients were included in this study. The median ADC-values differed significantly (ANOVA, p<0.001) across normal prostate tissue (1.05x10-3 mm2/s, SD?0.17), prostatitis (1.13x10-3 mm2/s, SD?0.19) and prostate cancer (0.86x10-3 mm2/s, SD?0.13). Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons of the three groups showed that there is a statistically significant difference in median ADC-values of prostate tissue with prostatitis and prostate cancer in the peripheral zone (p<0.001) and the central gland (p=0.03). Furthermore, a statistically significant difference was found in median ADC-values of normal prostate tissue and prostate cancer in the peripheral zone (p<0.001) and the central gland (p<0.001). {CONCLUSION} Median ADC-values can prospectively discriminate between prostate cancer and normal prostate tissue or prostatitis. {CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION} Fast non-invasive prediction of histological classification with diffusion weighted imaging in the prostate may improve patient management.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the accuracy and speed of a novel robotic technique as an aid to perform magnetic resonance image (MRI)-guided prostate biopsies on patients with cancer suspicious regions. METHODS: A pneumatic controlled MR-compatible manipulator with 5 degrees of freedom was developed in-house to guide biopsies under real-time imaging. From 13 consecutive biopsy procedures, the targeting error, biopsy error and target displacement were calculated to evaluate the accuracy. The time was recorded to evaluate manipulation and procedure time. RESULTS: The robotic and manual techniques demonstrated comparable results regarding mean targeting error (5.7 vs 5.8 mm, respectively) and mean target displacement (6.6 vs 6.0 mm, respectively). The mean biopsy error was larger (6.5 vs 4.4 mm) when using the robotic technique, although not significant. Mean procedure and manipulation time were 76 min and 6 min, respectively using the robotic technique and 61 and 8 min with the manual technique. CONCLUSIONS: Although comparable results regarding accuracy and speed were found, the extended technical effort of the robotic technique make the manual technique - currently - more suitable to perform MRI-guided biopsies. Furthermore, this study provided a better insight in displacement of the target during in vivo biopsy procedures.},

Two blinded independent readers searched for non-solid nodules on 5-mm multiplanar reconstructions, 1-mm slices and 7-mm maximum intensity projections (trial protocol). The reference standard was a consensus diagnosis of all non-solid nodules reported at least once. Results: Twenty-three individuals (10.6\%) had in total 34 non-solid nodules.

The purpose of this study was to investigate a new software program for semiautomatic measurement of the volume and mass of ground-glass nodules (GGNs) in a chest phantom and to investigate the influence of CT scanner, reconstruction filter, tube voltage, and tube current. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We used an anthropomorphic chest phantom with eight artificial GGNs with two different CT attenuations and four different volumes. CT scans were obtained with four models of CT scanner at 120 kVp and 25 mAs with a soft and a sharp reconstruction filter. On the 256-MDCT scanner, the tube current-exposure time product and tube voltage settings were varied. GGNs were measured with software that automatically segmented the nodules. Absolute percentage error (APE) was calculated for volume, mass, and density. Wilcoxon signed rank, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for analysis. RESULTS. Volume and mass did not differ significantly from the true values. When measurements were expressed as APE, the error range was 2-36\% for volume and 5-46\% for mass, which was significantly different from no error. We did not find significant differences in APE between CT scanners with filters for lower tube current for volume or lower tube voltage for mass. CONCLUSION. Computer-aided segmentation and mass and volume measurements of GGNs with the prototype software had promising results in this study.},

  abstract = {Accurate measurement of subsolid pulmonary nodules (SSN) is becoming increasingly important in the management of these nodules. SSNs were previously quantified with time-consuming manual measurements. The aim of the present study is to test the feasibility of semi-automatic SSNs measurements and to compare the results to the manual measurements.In 33 lung cancer screening participants with 33 SSNs, the nodules were previously quantified by two observers manually. In the present study two observers quantified these nodules by using semi-automated nodule volumetry software. Nodules were quantified for effective diameter, volume and mass. The manual and semi-automatic measurements were compared using Bland-Altman plots and paired T tests. Observer agreement was calculated as an intraclass correlation coefficient. Data are presented as mean (SD).Semi-automated measurements were feasible in all 33 nodules. Nodule diameter, volume and mass were 11.2 (3.3) mm, 935 (691) ml and 379 (311) milligrams for observer 1 and 11.1 (3.7) mm, 986 (797) ml and 399 (344) milligrams for observer 2, respectively. Agreement between observers and within observer 1 for the semi-automatic measurements was good with an intraclass correlation coefficient >0.89. For observer 1 and observer 2, measured diameter was 8.8\% and 10.3\% larger (p<0.001), measured volume was 24.3\% and 26.5\% larger (p<0.001) and measured mass was 10.6\% and 12.0\% larger (p<0.001) with the semi-automatic program compared to the manual measurements.Semi-automated measurement of the diameter, volume and mass of SSNs is feasible with good observer agreement. Semi-automated measurement makes quantification of mass and volume feasible in daily practice.},

  abstract = {With eight million deaths in 2012 lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the world, and the problem is still growing. As long as the goal of a total ban on smoking tobacco is not fulfilled, lung cancer screening as a means of secondary prevention has great potential. The aim of lung cancer screening is the detection of lung cancer in an early and hopefully curable stage resulting in a significant reduction in lung cancer deaths in the population. The Dutch Belgium lung cancer screening trial (NELSON), that included 15822 participants is the largest in Europe. The results of this trial, aiming at a reduction of the lung cancer mortality rate of 20%, are expected in 2015 or 2016. This thesis focuses on SubSolid Nodules (SSNs), a special kind of nodules that pose a growing problem in lung cancer screening. SubSolid Nodules are also referred to as Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) or Ground Glass Nodules (GGN). In this term ground glass is defined as a circumscribed area of increased lung attenuation with preservation of the bronchial and vascular margins. The problems with SSNs compared to solid nodules are in part inherent to the appearance of the nodules: SSNs are less dense and less well circumscript and thus not only harder to see on the image but also more difficult to measure accurately compared to solid nodules. The second problem with SSNs that makes them more difficult to handle codes comes the fact that their biological behavior is different from SSNs. Therefore a verdict of malignancy by the pathologist does not necessarily mean that the patient will benefit from treatment of that nodule. In this thesis we tried to make a contribution towards the solution of these problems by: AC/a,!AC/ reporting on the possible improvement of the visual detection of SSNs AC/a,!AC/ investigating several aspects of the semi-automatic segmentation of SSNs AC/a,!AC/ investigating the feasibility of the segmentation of a solid component in a SSN AC/a,!AC/ investigating a more conservative approach compared to present recommendations in managing SSNs. AC/a,!AC/ evaluating the radiological aspect of missed carcinomaAC/a,!a,,C/s in the NELSON trial. In conclusion, in this thesis we have demonstrated that semi-automatic segmentation of SSNs and its solid component is achievable with sufficient accuracy in an efficient manner. The restrained NELSON approach of SSNs has not lead to any interval or post screen carcinoma in the investigated follow up period. Furthermore we have shown that although interval or post screen carcinomas due to human errors are rare, there is room for improvement in the detection of intra bronchial lesions and that at present still a lot has to be learned about the significance of focal bulla wall thickening. However, even by demonstrating that the more restrictive NELSON approach of SSNs is to be preferred over the current recommendation, we still donAC/a,!a,,C/t know what the biological behavior of SSNs is, and consequently what would be the optimal screening or therapeutic strategy in these cases. Therefore several challenges still have to be met to optimize the strategy of lung cancer screening.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary subsolid nodules (SSNs) have a high likelihood of malignancy, but are often indolent. A conservative treatment approach may therefore be suitable. The aim of the current study was to evaluate whether close follow-up of SSNs with computed tomography may be a safe approach. The study population consisted of participants of the Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening trial (Nederlands Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek; NELSON). All SSNs detected during the trial were included in this analysis. Retrospectively, all persistent SSNs and SSNs that were resected after first detection were segmented using dedicated software, and maximum diameter, volume and mass were measured. Mass doubling time (MDT) was calculated. In total 7135 volunteers were included in the current analysis. 264 (3.3\%) SSNs in 234 participants were detected during the trial. 147 (63\%) of these SSNs in 126 participants disappeared at follow-up, leaving 117 persistent or directly resected SSNs in 108 (1.5\%) participants available for analysis. The median follow-up time was 95 months (range 20-110). 33 (28\%) SSNs were resected and 28 of those were (pre-) invasive. None of the non-resected SSNs progressed into a clinically relevant malignancy. Persistent SSNs rarely developed into clinically manifest malignancies unexpectedly. Close follow-up with computed tomography may be a safe option to monitor changes.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Detection of change between CT images is crucial in lung cancer screening. We analysed whether subtraction images can detect change in nodular size between successive low-dose CT images. Methods and Materials: Given two successive CT scans lung segmentation and non-rigid registration between the two scans is performed and a subtraction image is obtained by subtracting the deformed prior scan from the current scan. Subtraction images of a total of 111 participants of a lung cancer screening trial that were referred to a pulmonologist on the basis of the last CTwere studied. An experienced radiologist annotated all relevant nodular changes by inspecting the subtraction images. The two original images were available side-by-side for confirmation. In addition, the quality of the subtraction images, was scored on a 1-5 scale. Results: The quality of the subtraction images was rated high: only six subtraction images (4\%) had a rating lower than 4, meaning that the images were significantly degraded by artefacts. In the referred cases 58 new nodules > 5 mm were found. Furthermore 45 nodules with significant growth were noted. A significant nodule was missed in 8 cases, of which 2 were stable and hence not visible on the subtraction image, 1 was missed because of its pleural location and 5 showed a mean increase in the diameter of 21\%. Conclusion: Temporal subtraction of CT images is a promising tool for the visual detection of change, especially significant growth of nodules, between successive CT scans.},

  title = {At What Age Should Breast Screening Begin?},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: Ages for breast screening are set so as to optimize early breast cancer detection while minimizing costs and risk. In this study, we test the correlation of age to breast density to ascertain if there is a certain age when density change is greatest and thus where x-ray sensitivity improves markedly. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Volumetric breast density was calculated on digital mammograms of 69,000 women using Volpara, an FDA cleared, and fully automated breast density assessment tool for use on digital mammograms. The digital mammograms consisted of: - 15,000 women (aged 27-99) imaged on GE equipment in Toronto (screening and diagnosis) - 50,000 women (aged 50-70) imaged on Hologic equipment in Utrecht (screening) - 1,500 women (aged 45-70) imaged on Siemens equipment in Auckland (screening) - 400 women (aged 40-76) imaged on GE equipment in Greenville, North Carolina (screening) From the individual results for each woman, we then computed average breast density and inter-quartile range at each age and for each geographical location. RESULTS: The overall level of breast density differed between sites, most likely related to population. Greenville, for example, had 20% higher breast volumes, although it is known that the algorithm can over-estimate density when a tilted paddle is used such as in Utrecht. Previous results have shown Volpara producing similar results for the same breast imaged on Hologic and GE systems with standard paddle. Breast density decreased from 18% to 8% at Toronto (age 27 to 75), 14% to 7% at Utrecht and Auckland (50 to 75), and 10% to 5% in Greenville (40 to 75). At all sites density dimishes and then plateaus. Interestingly, the rates of breast density decrease appear similar across sites but there is no apparent abrupt change in density at any age. For all sites, at any given age there was considerable variation in breast density. For example, the inter-quartile ranges for the Toronto data were 13-23% at age 30, 8-18% at age 40, 7-17% at age 50, 4-12% at age 60 and 4-9% at age 70. CONCLUSION: Screening based purely on age may deny access to women who have less dense breasts and in whom x-ray sensitivity is high. Personalized risk/benefit analyses, including breast density assessment, may provide more suitable guidance for appropriate utilization of medical resources. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: Breast screening should be offered on the basis of breast density and risk factors, not just age.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The U.S. has launched an annual CT lung cancer screening program, irrespective of individual participants' malignancy risk. We developed a risk model based on information from the baseline CT and clinical information to calculate the trade-off between cost savings by omitting one year follow-up scans in low risk individuals and the number of delayed cancer diagnoses. Method and Materials: We used data from the National Lung Screening Trial. We selected all subjects who underwent a baseline scan and a one year follow up scan, those diagnosed with lung cancer after the baseline scan were excluded. Using baseline clinical data and baseline scan variables, various models were developed to estimate the risk of developing lung cancer after the one year follow-up scan, using backward stepwise regression. The full model included both clinical and scan variables. Additionally we tested a clinical-only model and a nodule-only model, the latter including the largest nodule diameter as the only variable. Furthermore, the published Brock and Patz models were validated on the same data set. Results: 174 of 24,542 participants were diagnosed with lung cancer in the year after the first annual follow up. Best predictors included in the full model were older age, higher smoking duration and intensity, shorter smoking quit time, previous COPD and cancer diagnosis, emphysema, longest and perpendicular diameter of the largest nodule, presence of subsolid nodules, presence of an upper lobe nodule, and presence of a spiculated nodule. Using our full model, 9,972, 16,298, 19,726, and 21,158 of the cancer-free persons could have safely avoided the one year follow-up scan, at the expense of delaying the diagnosis of 17, 44, 70, and 88 of the lung cancer patients, respectively. The area under the ROC curve ranged from 0.79 with our full model to 0.73 with the Brock model to 0.67 in the Patz model. Conclusion: Predictive models based on clinical and baseline scan information can be used to personalize follow up intervals in lung cancer screening, saving radiation and costs. Results differed substantially depending on the risk model used. Clinical Relevance/Application: Our model can be used to improve lung cancer screening efficiency by selecting a substantial proportion of participants for a two year follow-up interval, while delaying lung cancer diagnosis in only very few cases. This can greatly reduce costs, radiation burden and radiologist's work-load.},

  abstract = {Background: All lung cancer CT screening trials used fixed follow-up intervals, which may not be optimal. We developed new lung cancer risk models for personalising screening intervals to 1 year or 2 years, and compared these with existing models.
                             Methods: We included participants in the CT arm of the National Lung Screening Trial (2002-2010) who underwent a baseline scan and a first annual follow-up scan and were not diagnosed with lung cancer in the first year. True and false positives and the area under the curve of each model were calculated. Internal validation was performed using bootstrapping.
                             Results: Data from 24 542 participants were included in the analysis. The accuracy was 0.785, 0.693, 0.697, 0.666 and 0.727 for the polynomial, patient characteristics, diameter, Patz and PanCan models, respectively. Of the 24 542 participants included, 174 (0.71%) were diagnosed with lung cancer between the first and the second annual follow-ups. Using the polynomial model, 2558 (10.4%, 95% CI 10.0% to 10.8%), 7544 (30.7%, 30.2% to 31.3%), 10 947 (44.6%, 44.0% to 45.2%), 16 710 (68.1%, 67.5% to 68.7%) and 20 023 (81.6%, 81.1% to 92.1%) of the 24 368 participants who did not develop lung cancer in the year following the first follow-up screening round could have safely skipped it, at the expense of delayed diagnosis of 0 (0.0%, 0.0% to 2.7%), 8 (4.6%, 2.2% to 9.2%), 17 (9.8%, 6.0% to 15.4%), 44 (25.3%, 19.2% to 32.5%) and 70 (40.2%, 33.0% to 47.9%) of the 174 lung cancers, respectively.
                             Conclusions: The polynomial model, using both patient characteristics and baseline scan morphology, was significantly superior in assigning participants to 1-year or 2-year screening intervals. Implementing personalised follow-up intervals would enable hundreds of participants to skip a screening round per lung cancer diagnosis delayed.},

  abstract = {Purpose To study interreader variability for classifying pulmonary opacities at CT as perifissural nodules (PFNs) and determine how reliably radiologists differentiate PFNs from malignancies. Materials and Methods CT studies were obtained retrospectively from the National Lung Screening Trial (2002-2009). Nodules were eligible for the study if they were noncalcified, solid, within the size range of 5 to 10 mm, and scanned with a section thickness of 2 mm or less. Six radiologists classified 359 nodules in a cancer-enriched data set as PFN, non-PFN, or not applicable. Nodules classified as not applicable by at least three radiologists were excluded, leaving 316 nodules for post-hoc statistical analysis. Results The study group contained 22.2% cancers (70 of 316). The median proportion of nodules classified as PFNs was 45.6% (144 of 316). All six radiologists uniformly classified 17.7% (56 of 316) of the nodules as PFNs. The Fleiss k was 0.50. Compared with non-PFNs, nodules classified as PFNs were smaller and more often located in the lower lobes and attached to a fissure (P < .001). Thirteen (18.6%) of 70 cancers were misclassified 21 times as PFNs. Individual readers' misclassification rates ranged from 0% (0 of 125) to 4.9% (eight of 163). Of 13 misclassified malignancies, 11 were in the upper lobes and two were attached to a fissure. Conclusion There was moderate interreader agreement when classifying nodules as perifissural nodules. Less than 2.5% of perifissural nodule classifications were misclassified lung cancers (21 of 865) in this cancer-enriched study. Allowing nodules classified as perifissural nodules to be omitted from additional follow-up in a screening setting could substantially reduce the number of unnecessary scans; excluding perifissural nodules in the upper lobes would greatly decrease the misclassification rate.},

  booktitle = {European Societies of Cardiovascular Radiology and Thoracic Imaging joint meeting},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Purpose/Objectives: Pulmonary nodules on chest CT classified by radiologists as perifissural nodules (PFN) have been shown to have a negligible chance of malignancy. We studied the inter-observer variability for classifying nodules as PFNs in National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) data. Methods and Materials: Out of a sample of 5819 low-dose CT scans of slice thickness <=2mm from the NLST, we detected and annotated 3669 non-calcified solid nodules with diameters of 5 to 10mm. 359 nodules were selected for the observer study. With definitions provided, six radiologists independently classified these nodules as either "typical PFN,? "atypical PFN,? "non-PFN,? or "not applicable.? A "typical PFN? has a lentiform, triangular, or polygonal shape, is located on or within 10 mm of the visceral pleura or lung fissure, and has extending linear densities. An "atypical PFN? lacks one of the three key criteria defining a typical PFN. A "non-PFN? showed at least one of the following features: spiculation, irregular shape, un-sharp borders, and distortion of the pleura or fissure. Adherence to these definitions was not required. Opacities deemed to be subsolid, completely calcified, not nodular, or not visible were considered "not applicable?; when rated as such by at least three radiologists, these were excluded (n=43). This left 316 nodules for analysis using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests, and Fleiss' kappa (k). Results: Fifty-six of 316 nodules (17.7%) were classified by all six radiologists as either typical or atypical PFNs. More than four times the number, 229/316 nodules (72.5%), were classified by at least one radiologist as PFNs. k was 0.50; when distinguishing PFN subgroups, k decreased to 0.30. Only 7/316 nodules (2.2%) were unanimously classified as typical PFNs; none were atypical PFNs by unanimity. Compared to non-PFNs, nodules classified by at least three readers as either typical or atypical PFNs were smaller on average and were more often located in the lower lobes and attached to a fissure (p<0.001). Pleural attachment was not a good distinguishing factor between PFNs and non-PFNs (p=0.54). Conclusion: There is only a fair to moderate inter-radiologist agreement when classifying pulmonary nodules as PFNs. More than two-thirds of all nodules in our sample were considered to be a PFN by at least one radiologist; less than one-fifth were PFNs by full consensus, and considerably less when distinguishing PFN subgroups. This suggests that better criteria for identifying PFNs need to be developed and adhered to.},

  booktitle = {European Societies of Cardiovascular Radiology and Thoracic Imaging Joint Meeting},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Purpose/Objectives: One of the main pathophysiological mechanisms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is inflammation mediated by the immune system. Intrapulmonary lymph nodes have a distinctive computed tomography (CT) morphology as perifissural nodules (PFN). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation between the number of PFNs and emphysema scores. Methods and Materials: CT scans, lung function performances, and clinical data were obtained from the COPDGene study. Forty participants were randomly selected per GOLD stages groups 0 through 4, (n=200). The baseline scans were screened for nodules by a trained medical researcher with support from computer-aided detection (CAD) software. Nodules which were considered solid, had sharp borders, lacked spiculation, and were not completely calcified were assessed independently by two experienced radiologists. The number of these nodules classified as PFNs was counted per scan and averaged per GOLD stage group, and normalized emphysema score (NormES-950)- and 10mm airway lumen perimeter (Pi10)-based groups divided by quartiles. Statistical analyses was done using descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, and Cohen's kappa. Results: Three of 200 (1.5%) scans could not be processed by the CAD. Out of 175 scans, 584 CAD annotations were accepted and an additional 172 nodules were identified. 174 calcified, 20 ground glass, 8 subsolid, and 136 spiculated, unsharp, or irregularly shaped solid nodules were excluded by the trained medical researcher. The median diameter and volume of the remaining 418 nodules were 3.9mm (25th percentile (P25)=2.6mm, 75thpercentile (P75)=5.6mm) and 18.4mm3 (P25=8.1mm3, P75=40.4mm3), respectively. Readers A and B independently classified 198/418 (47.4%) and 311/418 (74.4%) of the remaining nodules as PFNs, respectively. The interrater agreement was 0.34 (Cohen's kappa). The average number of PFNs found in GOLD groups 0 to 4 were, respectively, 0.90, 1.00, 0.98, 1.15, and 1.00 for Reader A (p=0.97), and 1.44, 1.55, 1.38, 1.70, and 1.83 for Reader B (p=0.84). The medians of the NormES and Pi10 were 7.24HU (P25=2.45HU, P75=19.17HU) and 2.35mm (P25=1.95mm, P75=2.80mm), respectively. ANOVA of the average number of PFNs between the NormES and Pi10 quartiles respectively resulted in p-values of <0.001 and 0.499 for Reader A, and 0.001 and 0.585 for Reader B. Conclusion: Despite fair interreader agreement, higher NormES is associated with greater average numbers of PFNs. There are no statistically significant differences across GOLD stages and Pi10 quartiles. In practice, a scan may only contain whole numbers of PFNs; additionally, due to high variation, PFN count is not recommended for differentiating stages of COPD.},

  title = {Improved Lung Cancer and Mortality Prediction Accuracy Using Survival Models Based on Semi-Automatic CT Image Measurements},
  booktitle = {World Conference on Lung Cancer},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Background: In a lung cancer CT screening setting, imaging biomarkers are typically extracted by experienced human readers. We found that adding semi-automatic computer-aided detection (CAD) measurements to a base model significantly improved lung cancer and mortality risk prediction accuracy. Method: Participants' baseline CT scans, characteristics, and 7-year follow-up outcomes were obtained from the National Lung Screening Trial. The selection included all 1810 deceased and a random selection of 4190 surviving participants from the CT screening arm with an image available; the latter subcohort was sampled with replacement up to 24432 to approximate the full CT arm. Seventeen patient characteristics variables endorsed by literature were considered for each model. CAD was used to automatically measure normalized emphysema score, coronary calcium volume, and thoracic aorta calcium volume. Pulmonary nodule consistency, volume, solid core volume (if part-solid), and upper lobe location were annotated by an experienced radiologist with CAD support. Only the largest noncalcified nodule was considered for the model; having no nodules was the reference. Cox proportional hazard regression was performed on patient characteristics variables only (base model) and combined with CAD variables (new model). This was done for three outcomes: lung cancer diagnosis, lung cancer mortality, and overall mortality. The average continuous net reclassification improvements (NRI) between the base and new models were calculated for each year following the baseline scan. To calculate NRI, the net percentages of subjects with and without the event of interest correctly reclassified as high and low risk, respectively, are summed (maximum range: -2 to 2); positive scores indicate that the new model is more accurate. Result: CAD measures were successfully computed for 5575 baseline scans. After sampling, the test cohort consisted of 24370 participants. 3.9% were diagnosed with lung cancer (940/24370) and 6.9% died (1681/24370), of which 24.9% due to lung cancer (418/1681). For all outcomes, the new models were significantly superior to the base model. With lung cancer diagnosis as the outcome, the NRI at 1, 4, and 7 years follow-up were 0.628 (95% confidence interval: 0.373-0.700), 0.331 (0.261-0.390), and 0.349 (0.293-0.389), respectively. The respective NRIs were 0.501 (0.290-0.642), 0.288 (0.221-0.374), and 0.255 (0.218-0.339) when predicting lung cancer mortality and 0.496 (0.295-0.610), 0.301 (0.239-0.376), and 0.270 (0.201-0.320) when predicting overall mortality. Conclusion: CAD measures of emphysema and atherosclerosis and CAD-supported pulmonary nodule annotations are of added value for predicting lung cancer and mortality. These new models may be used to further personalize lung cancer CT screening follow-up protocols.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Purpose: Normalized emphysema score (normES) is a protocol-robust and validated CT biomarker for mortality. We aimed to improve mortality prediction by modelling its change over time. Method and materials: CT scans from all 1810 deceased participants from the National Lung Screening Trial were selected. Of these, 445 died from lung cancer. A random selection of 4190 surviving participants were sampled with replacement up to 24432 to approximate the full cohort. The normES was obtained by computing the emphysema scores after resampling, normalization, and bullae cluster analysis. The reference models contained solely the baseline (T0) normES. To investigate if progression of emphysema provides additional information, normES from the first (T1) and second annual screening rounds (T2) and normES progression (normESprog) were added to the base model. normESprog was calculated by subtracting the T0 log(normES) from the T1 or T2 log(normES) and dividing by the time in between. Proportional hazard models predicting all-cause and lung cancer mortality were compared by calculating the continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) for each year of follow-up. Results: The analysis of T0 and T1 data was performed on 22695 samples; 3547 lacked T0 or T1 scans, or had corrupted data. NRI improvement for all-cause and lung cancer mortality prediction compared to the base models were 4.5% (95%CI: -7.3 to 8.4%) and 4.1% (-9.3 to 14.6%) 3 years after baseline, 6.1% (-5.3 to 9.4%) and 0.1% (-7.1 to 12.2%) after 5 years, and 6.1% (-6.2 to 8.7%) and -0.4% (-5.6 to 11.3%) after 7 years, respectively. When modelling the T0 to T2 interval, another 2603 samples were excluded. For all-cause mortality, the 3, 5, and 7 year time points showed respective NRI improvements of -0.5% (-6.7 to 8.0%), 10.8% (5.5% to 14.7%), and 12.2% (7.1% to 15.6%). Improvements in lung cancer mortality prediction were -6.1% (-24.0 to 12.6%), 19.6% (10.6 to 29.2%), and 24.1% (15.4% to 31.7%), respectively. All hazard models had a logrank test p<.001. Conclusion: Two normES measurements are better than one at predicting mortality over longer periods of time. The time between normES measurements should be sufficiently distant to account for the slow progression of emphysema.},

We aimed to improve mortality prediction by including the emphysema score progression rate-its change over time-into the models. CT scans from 6000 National Lung Screening Trial CT arm participants were included. Of these, 1810 died (445 lung cancer-specific). The remaining 4190 survivors were sampled with replacement up to 24432 to approximate the full cohort. Three overlapping subcohorts were formed which required participants to have images from specific screening rounds. Emphysema scores were obtained after resampling, normalization, and bullae cluster analysis of the original images. Base models contained solely the latest emphysema score. Progression models included emphysema score progression rate. Models were adjusted by including baseline age, sex, BMI, smoking status, smoking intensity, smoking duration, and previous COPD diagnosis. Cox proportional hazard models predicting all-cause and lung cancer mortality were compared by calculating the area under the curve per year follow-up. In the subcohort of participants with baseline and first annual follow-up scans, the analysis was performed on 4940 participants (23227 after resampling). Area under the curve for all-cause mortality predictions of the base and progression models 6 years after baseline were 0.564 (0.564 to 0.565) and 0.569 (0.568 to 0.569) when unadjusted, and 0.704 (0.703 to 0.704) to 0.705 (0.704 to 0.705) when adjusted.

Including emphysema score progression rate into risk models shows no clinically relevant improvement in mortality risk prediction. This is because scan normalization does not adjust for an overall change in lung density. Adjusting for changes in smoking behavior is likely required to make this a clinically useful measure of emphysema progression.},

Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography scans and color fundus photographs were obtained of 260 patients. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography scans were graded for the number of HF and other morphological characteristics. The distribution of HF across different stages of DR and DME severity were studied. Linear mixed-model analysis was used to study associations between the number of HF and clinical and morphological parameters. Higher numbers of HF were found in patients with either stage of DME versus patients without DME (P < 0.001). A trend was observed between increasing numbers of HF and DR severity, although significance was only reached for moderate nonproliferative DR (P = 0.001) and proliferative DR (P = 0.019). Higher numbers of HF were associated with longer diabetes duration (P = 0.029), lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.005), and the presence of microalbuminuria (P = 0.005). In addition, HF were associated with morphological characteristics on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, including central retinal thickness (P = 0.004), cysts (P < 0.001), subretinal fluid (P = 0.001), and disruption of the external limiting membrane (P = 0.018). The number of HF was associated with different stages of DR and DME severity. The associations between HF and clinical and morphological characteristics can be of use in further studies evaluating the role of HF as a biomarker for disease progression and treatment response.},

  abstract = {Purpose: One of the main pathophysiological mechanisms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is inflammation, which has been associated with lymphadenopathy. Intrapulmonary lymph nodes can be identified on CT as perifissural nodules (PFN). We investigated the association between the number and size of PFNs and measures of COPD severity. Materials and Methods: CT images were obtained from COPDGene. 50 subjects were randomly selected per GOLD stage (0 to 4), GOLD-unclassified, and never-smoker groups and allocated to either "Healthy," "Mild," or "Moderate/severe" groups. 26/350 (7.4%) subjects had missing images and were excluded. Supported by computer-aided detection, a trained researcher prelocated non-calcified opacities larger than 3 mm in diameter. Included lung opacities were classified independently by two radiologists as either "PFN," "not a PFN," "calcified," or "not a nodule"; disagreements were arbitrated by a third radiologist. Ordinal logistic regression was performed as the main statistical test. Results: A total of 592 opacities were included in the observer study. A total of 163/592 classifications (27.5%) required arbitration. A total of 17/592 opacities (2.9%) were excluded from the analysis because they were not considered nodular, were calcified, or all three radiologists disagreed. A total of 366/575 accepted nodules (63.7%) were considered PFNs. A maximum of 10 PFNs were found in one image; 154/324 (47.5%) contained no PFNs. The number of PFNs per subject did not differ between COPD severity groups (\textit{p} = 0.50). PFN short-axis diameter could significantly distinguish between the Mild and Moderate/severe groups, but not between the Healthy and Mild groups (\textit{p} = 0.021). Conclusions: There is no relationship between PFN count and COPD severity. There may be a weak trend of larger intrapulmonary lymph nodes among patients with more advanced stages of COPD.},

  abstract = {Lung cancer computed tomography (CT) screening trials using low-dose CT have repeatedly demonstrated a reduction in the number of lung cancer deaths in the screening group compared to a control group. With various countries currently considering the implementation of lung cancer screening, recurring discussion points are, among others, the potentially high false positive rates, cost-effectiveness, and the availability of radiologists for scan interpretation. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to increase the efficiency of lung cancer screening. We discuss the performance levels of AI algorithms for various tasks related to the interpretation of lung screening CT scans, how they compare to human experts, and how AI and humans may complement each other. We discuss how AI may be used in the lung cancer CT screening workflow according to the current evidence and describe the additional research that will be required before AI can take a more prominent role in the analysis of lung screening CT scans.},

  abstract = {Several studies investigated the appearance of intrapulmonary lymph nodes (IPLNs) at CT with pathologic correlation. IPLNs are benign lesions and do not require follow-up after initial detection. There are indications that IPLNs represent a considerable portion of incidentally found pulmonary nodules seen at high-resolution CT. The reliable and accurate identification of IPLNs as benign nodules may substantially reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up CT examinations. Typical CT features of IPLNs are a noncalcified solid nodule with sharp margins; a round, oval, or polygonal shape; distanced 15 mm or less from the pleura; and most being located below the level of the carina. The term perifissural nodule (PFN) was coined based on some of these characteristics. Standardization of those CT criteria are a prerequisite for accurate nodule classification. However, four different definitions of PFNs can currently be found in the literature. Furthermore, there is considerable variation in the reported interobserver agreement, malignancy rate, and prevalence of PFNs. The purpose of this review was to provide an overview of what is known about PFNs. In addition, knowledge gaps in defining PFNs will be discussed. A decision tree to guide clinicians in classifying nodules as PFNs is provided.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Combined assessment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer (LC) may improve the effectiveness of LC screening in smokers. The aims were to derive and assess risk models for predicting LC incidence, CVD mortality, and COPD mortality by combining quantitative CT measures from each disease, and to quantify the added predictive benefit of self-reported patient characteristics given the availability of a CT scan. Methods: A survey model (patient characteristics only), CT model (CT information only), and final model (all variables) were derived for each outcome using parsimonious Cox regression on a sample from the National Lung Screening Trial (n=15 000). Validation was performed using Multicentric Italian Lung Detection data (n=2287). Time-dependent measures of model discrimination and calibration are reported. Results: Age, mean lung density, emphysema score, bronchial wall thickness, and aorta calcium volume are variables which contributed to all final models. Nodule features were crucial for LC incidence predictions but did not contribute to CVD and COPD mortality prediction. In the derivation cohort, the LC incidence CT model had a 5-year area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 82*5%% (95%% confidence interval=80*9-84*0%), significantly inferior to that of the final model (84*0%, 82*6-85*5%). However, the addition of patient characteristics did not improve the LC incidence model performance in the validation cohort (CT model=80*1%, 74*2-86*0%; final model=79*9, 73*9-85*8%). Similarly, the final CVD mortality model outperformed the other two models in the derivation cohort (survey model=74*9%, 72*7-77*1%; CT model=76*3%, 74*1-78*5%; final model=79*1%, 77*0-81*2%) but not the validation cohort (survey model=74*8%, 62*2-87*5%; CT model=72*1%, 61*1-83*2%; final model=72*2%, 60*4-84*0%). Combining patient characteristics and CT measures provided the largest increase in accuracy for the COPD mortality final model (92*3%, 90*1-94*5%) compared to either other model individually (survey model=87*5%, 84*3-90*6%; CT model=87*9%, 84*8-91*0%), but no external validation was performed due to a very low event frequency. Conclusions: CT measures of CVD and COPD provides small but reproducible improvements to nodule-based LC risk prediction accuracy from 3 years' onwards. Self-reported patient characteristics may not be of added predictive value when CT information is available.},

  title = {Lung cancer screening: use the scan to decide who to scan when},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer deaths worldwide. One of the most effective ways to reduce lung cancer mortality is early diagnosis, which can be achieved via CT screening. However, deciding who and when to screen is challenging because it is difficult to estimate a person's risk of developing lung cancer in the future. Screening involves trade-offs: the goal is to diagnose lung cancer in its early stages while performing as few scans as possible. Fewer scans result in lower health-care costs, less work for medical personnel, and a lower burden on participants. By using information from the CT scan, risk models can be developed which can more accurately predict the risk of lung cancer in screening participants. The models and recommendations described in his PhD thesis can be used to personalize screening strategies, where participants with a lower risk are scanned less frequently.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To microsimulate the effects of three additional annual CT screening rounds on lung cancer (LC) survival in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Methods: We used multiple imputation to model the effect of additional screening in the full NLST cohort on the time to LC diagnosis and on LC death in those participants who were diagnosed with LC by the end of NLST. Nodule growth models were derived from a Dutch in-vivo study. Microsimulations were repeated 500 times. The method was validated by simulating three rounds of CT screening in the original chest radiography (CXR) cohort. The times up to which the simulations remained within the 95% confidence bands of the CT cohort's original results were used to estimate the validity of the results in the CT cohort with three additional simulated screening rounds. Results: Validation of the simulation approach on the CXR cohort resulted in a LC mortality reduction which remained well within the 95% confidence intervals of the original CT cohort up to 6.5 years after the start of simulations. Simulating additional CT screening in the CT cohort led to LCs being diagnosed earlier than originally, resulting in a relative risk reduction in LC mortality of 11% (95% confidence bands, 7% to 14%) at 6.5 years. This is equivalent to preventing 71% (48% to 94%) more LC deaths than the original CT cohort achieved in comparison to the original CXR cohort. Conclusion: Three additional annual CT screening rounds in the NLST may have led to substantial further LC mortality reduction.},

All patients who were diagnosed with LC by 2014 and a random selection of LC-free patients were considered. LC patients who were determined to be LC-free at the time of the scan and all LC-free patients with an adequate scan were included. The nodule count and types (solid, part-solid, ground-glass, and perifissural) were recorded per scan. Age, sex, and other CT measures were included to control for confounding factors. The cohort included 163 LC patients and 1178 LC-free patients. Cox regression revealed that the number of ground-glass nodules and part-solid nodules present were positively correlated to future LC risk. The area under the receiver operating curve of parsimonious models with and without nodule type information were 0.827 and 0.802, respectively. The presence of subsolid nodules in a clinical setting may be a risk factor for future LC development in another pulmonary location in a dose-dependent manner. Replication of the results in screening cohorts is required for maximum utility of these findings.},

  abstract = {Purpose A baseline CT scan for lung cancer (LC) screening may reveal information indicating that certain LC screening participants can be screened less, and instead require dedicated early cardiac and respiratory clinical input. We aimed to develop and validate competing death (CD) risk models using CT information to identify participants with a low LC and a high CD risk.Methods Participant demographics and quantitative CT measures of LC, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were considered for deriving a logistic regression model for predicting five-year CD risk using a sample from the National Lung Screening Trial (n=15 000). Multicentric Italian Lung Detection data was used to perform external validation (n=2287).Results Our final CD model outperformed an external pre-scan model (CDRAT) in both the derivation (Area under the curve=0.744 [95\% confidence interval=0.727 to 0.761] and 0.677 [0.658 to 0.695], respectively) and validation cohorts (0.744 [0.652 to 0.835] and 0.725 [0.633 to 0.816], respectively). By also taking LC incidence risk into consideration, we suggested a risk threshold where a subgroup (6258/23 096, 27\%) was identified with a number needed to screen to detect one LC of 216 (versus 23 in the remainder of the cohort) and ratio of 5.41 CDs per LC case (versus 0.88). The respective values in the validation cohort subgroup (774/2287, 34\%) were 129 (versus 29) and 1.67 (versus 0.43).Conclusions Evaluating both LC and CD risks post-scan may improve the efficiency of LC screening and facilitate the initiation of multidisciplinary trajectories among certain participants.FootnotesThis manuscript has recently been accepted for publication in the European Respiratory Journal.

  abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer deaths in western societies by 2030, was flagged as a neglected cancer by the European Commission and the United States Congress. Due to lack of investment in research and development, combined with a complex and aggressive tumour biology, PDAC overall survival has not significantly improved the past decades. Cross-sectional imaging and histopathology play a crucial role throughout the patient pathway. However, current clinical guidelines for diagnostic workup, patient stratification, treatment response assessment, and follow-up are non-uniform and lack evidence-based consensus. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can leverage multimodal data to improve patient outcomes, but PDAC AI research is too scattered and lacking in quality to be incorporated into clinical workflows. This review describes the patient pathway and derives touchpoints for image-based AI research in collaboration with a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional expert panel. The literature exploring AI to address these touchpoints is thoroughly retrieved and analysed to identify the existing trends and knowledge gaps. The results show absence of multi-institutional, well-curated datasets, an essential building block for robust AI applications. Furthermore, most research is unimodal, does not use state-of-the-art AI techniques, and lacks reliable ground truth. Based on this, the future research agenda for clinically relevant, image-driven AI in PDAC is proposed.},

  title = {Deep Learning for Detection of Iso-attenuating Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma in Computed Tomography},
  abstract = {Purpose: Investigate the ability of deep learning to localize iso-attenuating pancreatic adenocacinoma (pCa) in computed tomography (CT) images and assess the effect of including prior anatomy information on localization performance. This retrospective study included contrast-enhanced CT scans in the portal venous phase of 44 patients from the public Medical Segmentation Decathlon dataset, who had a visually iso-attenuating tumour. Two previously developed deep learning (DL) algorithms based on the 3D nnUnet framework were applied to the set of iso-attenuating lesions: one considering only tumour information for training (nnUnet_T) and one considering surrounding anatomical structures, namely  the pancreas parenchyma, common bile duct, pancreatic duct, arteries and veins in additional to the tumor (nnUNet_MS). Each model creates 10 different outputs, based on 2 random initialisations and 5-fold crossvalidation. The performance of the two models at pCa localization was evaluated with average precision and a permutation test was performed to show statistical significance. Results: The average precision for the nnUNet_MS was 80.03 % +- 8.6%, while for the nnUnet_T model it was 72.87% +- 7.1% (p<0.05). This indicates that surrounding anatomy aids the localization of iso-attenuating pCa lesions. By having access to prior anatomy information during training the network can better focus on the regions of the image where the tumor is located, avoiding confusion with other anatomical structures. Conclusion: In current clinical workup the detection of iso-attenuating pCa lesions on CT is very challenging, as the attenuation is similar to the pancreas parenchyma. The proposed 3D nnUnet_MS model can be used to detect and localize iso-attenuating lesions. Clinical relevance statement: Iso-attenuating pCa is linked to earlier stages of disease and better outcome, but is challenging to detect on CT. DL can accurately detect iso-attenuating lesions and benefits from anatomy information.},

High image quality is essential for proper diagnostics and computer-aided detection. We propose an automated image quality assessment system for ABUS images that detects artifacts at the time of acquisition. Therefore, we study three aspects that can corrupt ABUS images: the nipple position relative to the rest of the breast, the shadow caused by the nipple, and the shape of the breast contour on the image. Image processing and machine learning algorithms are combined to detect these artifacts based on 368 clinical ABUS images that have been rated manually by two experienced clinicians. At a specificity of 0.99, 55% of the images that were rated as low quality are detected by the proposed algorithms. The areas under the ROC curves of the single classifiers are 0.99 for the nipple position, 0.84 for the nipple shadow, and 0.89 for the breast contour shape. The proposed algorithms work fast and reliably, which makes them adequate for online evaluation of image quality during acquisition. The presented concept may be extended to further image modalities and quality aspects.},

  abstract = {Vulnerable plaques are the major cause of carotid and coronary vascular problems, such as heart attack or stroke. A correct modelling of plaque echo-morphology and composition can help the identification of such lesions. The Rayleigh distribution is widely used to describe (nearly) homogeneous areas in ultrasound images. Since plaques may contain tissues with heterogeneous regions more complex distributions depending on multiple parameters are usually needed, such as Rice, K or Nakagami distributions. In such cases, the problem formulation becomes more complex and the optimization procedure to estimate the plaque echo-morphology is more difficult. Here we propose to model the tissue echo-morphology by means of a mixture of Rayleigh distributions, known as Rayleigh Mixture Model. The problem formulation is still simple but its ability to describe complex textural patterns is very powerful. In this paper we present a method for the automatic estimation of the RMM mixture parameters by means of the Expectation Maximization algorithm which aims at characterizing tissue echomorphology in ultrasound. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated with a database of in-vitro IVUS cases. We show that the mixture coefficients and Rayleigh parameters explicitly derived from the mixture model are able to accurately describe different plaque types and to significantly improve the characterization performance of an already existing methodology.},

  abstract = {Screening for breast cancer with mammography has been introduced in various countries over the last 30 years, initially using analog screen-film-based systems and, over the last 20 years, transitioning to the use of fully digital systems. With the introduction of digitization, the computer interpretation of images has been a subject of intense interest, resulting in the introduction of computer-aided detection (CADe) and diagnosis (CADx) algorithms in the early 2000's. Although they were introduced with high expectations, the potential improvement in the clinical realm failed to materialize, mostly due to the high number of false positive marks per analyzed image.

                            In the last five years, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in computing, driven mostly by deep learning and convolutional neural networks, has also pervaded the field of automated breast cancer detection in digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis. Research in this area first involved comparison of its capabilities to that of conventional CADe/CADx methods, which quickly demonstrated the potential of this new technology. In the last couple of years, more mature and some commercial products have been developed, and studies of their performance compared to that of experienced breast radiologists are showing that these algorithms are on par with human-performance levels in retrospective data sets. Although additional studies, especially prospective evaluations performed in the real screening environment, are needed, it is becoming clear that AI will have an important role in the future breast cancer screening realm. Exactly how this new player will shape this field remains to be determined, but recent studies are already evaluating different options for implementation of this technology.

                            The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the basic concepts and developments in the field AI for breast cancer detection in digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis. The pitfalls of conventional methods, and how these are, for the most part, avoided by this new technology, will be discussed. Importantly, studies that have evaluated the current capabilities of AI and proposals for how these capabilities should be leveraged in the clinical realm will be reviewed, while the questions that need to be answered before this vision becomes a reality are posed.},

  abstract = {Vertebral labelling and segmentation are two fundamental tasks in an automated spine processing pipeline. Reliable and accurate processing of spine images is expected to benefit clinical decision support systems for diagnosis, surgery planning, and population-based analysis of spine and bone health. However, designing automated algorithms for spine processing is challenging predominantly due to considerable variations in anatomy and acquisition protocols and due to a severe shortage of publicly available data. Addressing these limitations, the Large Scale Vertebrae Segmentation Challenge (VerSe) was organised in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2019 and 2020, with a call for algorithms tackling the labelling and segmentation of vertebrae. Two datasets containing a total of 374 multi-detector CT scans from 355 patients were prepared and 4505 vertebrae have individually been annotated at voxel level by a human-machine hybrid algorithm (https://osf.io/nqjyw/, https://osf.io/t98fz/). A total of 25 algorithms were benchmarked on these datasets. In this work, we present the results of this evaluation and further investigate the performance variation at the vertebra level, scan level, and different fields of view. We also evaluate the generalisability of the approaches to an implicit domain shift in data by evaluating the top-performing algorithms of one challenge iteration on data from the other iteration. The principal takeaway from VerSe: the performance of an algorithm in labelling and segmenting a spine scan hinges on its ability to correctly identify vertebrae in cases of rare anatomical variations.

  abstract = {Esophageal cancer is the fastest rising type of cancer in the Western world. The novel technology of High Definition (HD) endoscopy enables physicians to find texture patterns related to early cancer. It encourages the development of a Computer-Aided Decision (CAD) system in order to help physicians with faster identification of early cancer and decrease the miss rate. However, an appropriate texture feature extraction, which is needed for classification, has not been studied yet. In this paper, we compare several techniques for texture feature extraction, including co-occurrence matrix features, LBP and Gabor features and evaluate their performance in detecting early stage cancer in HD endoscopic images. In order to exploit more image characteristics, we introduce an efficient combination of the texture and color features. Furthermore, we add a specific preprocessing step designed for endoscopy images, which improves the classification accuracy. After reducing the feature dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we classify selected features with a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experimental results validated by an expert gastroenterologist show that the proposed feature extraction is promising and reaches a classification accuracy up to 96.48%.},

  title = {Automatic Detection of Large Pulmonary Nodules in Thoracic {CT} Images},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: Existing computer-aided detection (CAD) systems excel at finding small nodules but often fail to detect the much rarer larger nodules. However, these large nodules are highly suspicious for being cancer. Therefore, we developed a CAD system specifically designed to detect large nodules. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Data from the publicly available LIDC/IDRI database was used. CT scans with section thickness over 2.5 mm were excluded. We selected all scans in which at least one of the four radiologists who read each case, annotated a solid nodule larger than 10 mm. The detection pipeline is initiated by a three-dimensional lung segmentation algorithm. Large nodules attached to the pleural wall are often excluded in this segmentation. Therefore, a rolling-ball algorithm was applied to the lung segmentation to include these nodules. The detection of nodule candidates was performed using a cascade of double threshold on intensity, followed by morphological operation. Connected component analysis was subsequently applied to get initial nodule candidates. The segmentation of the initial candidates was refined using a previously published nodule segmentation method. For each candidate, a total of nine intensity and shape features were extracted. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a radial basis function was used to classify nodule candidates and performance was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. CAD marks on nodules annotated by all four radiologists were counted as true positives. CAD marks on nodules annotated by less than four radiologists were ignored in the analysis. Other CAD marks were considered false positives. RESULTS: In 271 scans, 208 large nodules were annotated by all four radiologists. The candidate detection stage detected 98.6% (205/208) of the large nodules, with an average of 44.6 false positives per scan. After classification, the CAD system achieved a sensitivity of 95.7% (199/208) and 84.6% (176/208) at 7.5 and 1.0 false positives per scan, respectively. CONCLUSION: A dedicated CAD system for large pulmonary nodules can identify the vast majority of highly suspicious lesions in thoracic CT scans with a small number of false positives. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: As computers start to gain a more important role in CT lung cancer screening, it is vital that CAD reaches a high sensitivity in the detection of large nodules, which are likely to be cancer.},

  abstract = {Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) has been shown to be a promising tool for automatic detection of pulmonary nodules from computed tomography (CT) images. However, the vast majority of detected nodules are benign and do not require any treatment. For effective implementation of lung cancer screening programs, accurate identification of malignant nodules is the key. We investigate strategies to improve the performance of a CAD system in detecting nodules with a high probability of being cancers. Two strategies were proposed: (1) combining CAD detections with a recently published lung cancer risk prediction model and (2) the combination of multiple CAD systems. First, CAD systems were used to detect the nodules. Each CAD system produces markers with a certain degree of suspicion. Next, the malignancy probability was automatically computed for each marker, given nodule characteristics measured by the CAD system. Last, CAD degree of suspicion and malignancy probability were combined using the product rule. We evaluated the method using 62 nodules which were proven to be malignant cancers, from 180 scans of the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial. The malignant nodules were considered as positive samples, while all other findings were considered negative. Using a product rule, the best proposed system achieved an improvement in sensitivity, compared to the best individual CAD system, from 41.9% to 72.6% at 2 false positives (FPs)/scan and from 56.5% to 88.7% at 8 FPs/scan. Our experiment shows that combining a nodule malignancy probability with multiple CAD systems can increase the performance of computerized detection of lung cancer.},

  abstract = {Automatic detection of pulmonary nodules in thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans has been an active area of research for the last two decades. However, there have only been few studies that provide a comparative performance evaluation of different systems on a common database. We have therefore set up the LUNA16 challenge, an objective evaluation framework for automatic nodule detection algorithms using the largest publicly available reference database of chest CT scans, the LIDC-IDRI data set. In LUNA16, participants develop their algorithm and upload their predictions on 888 CT scans in one of the two tracks: 1) the complete nodule detection track where a complete CAD system should be developed, or 2) the false positive reduction track where a provided set of nodule candidates should be classified. This paper describes the setup of LUNA16 and presents the results of the challenge so far. Moreover, the impact of combining individual systems on the detection performance was also investigated. It was observed that the leading solutions employed convolutional networks and used the provided set of nodule candidates. The combination of these solutions achieved an excellent sensitivity of over 95% at fewer than 1.0 false positives per scan. This highlights the potential of combining algorithms to improve the detection performance. Our observer study with four expert readers has shown that the best system detects nodules that were missed by expert readers who originally annotated the LIDC-IDRI data. We released this set of additional nodules for further development of CAD systems.},

However, the performance of these algorithms drop when the testing cases are taken from a different domain (i.e. samples acquired using a different MRI scanner). In this research, we have investigated the performances of the state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques beginning from the simple solutions like histogram matching to the more advanced deep learning based models like CycleGAN. We do not introduce any new novel method in this study rather we have reapplied the current state-of-the-art techniques and compared the performances. From our experimental results, we have deduced that simple solutions are not adequate to capture the complexity of medical images and hence fail to obtain domain generalization. We have to rely on advanced techniques that take into account not just the intensity information but also the spatial information to achieve our goal.},

                            The diagnostic reading of follow-up low-dose whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) examinations in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) is a demanding process. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and benefit of a novel software program providing rapid-subtraction maps for bone lesion change detection.

                            Methods
                            Sixty patients (66 years +- 10 years) receiving 120 WBCT examinations for follow-up evaluation of MM bone disease were identified from our imaging archive. The median follow-up time was 292 days (range 200-641 days). Subtraction maps were calculated from 2-mm CT images using a nonlinear deformation algorithm. Reading time, correctly assessed lesions, and disease classification were compared to a standard reading software program. De novo clinical reading by a senior radiologist served as the reference standard. Statistics included Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Cohen's kappa coefficient, and calculation of sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value, and accuracy.

                            Results
                            Calculation time for subtraction maps was 84 s +- 24 s. Both readers reported exams faster using subtraction maps (reader A, 438 s +- 133 s; reader B, 1049 s +- 438 s) compared to PACS software (reader A, 534 s +- 156 s; reader B, 1486 s +- 587 s; p < 0.01). The course of disease was correctly classified by both methods in all patients. Sensitivity for lesion detection in subtraction maps/conventional reading was 92%/80% for reader A and 88%/76% for reader B. Specificity was 98%/100% for reader A and 95%/96% for reader B.

                            Conclusion
                            A software program for the rapid-subtraction map calculation of follow-up WBCT scans has been successfully tested and seems suited for application in clinical routine. Subtraction maps significantly facilitated reading of WBCTs by reducing reading time and increasing sensitivity.},

CAD was run also on first and second incidence round. Rate of agreement was calculated by weighted k test. Sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated according to cumulative number of subjects with detected nodules (VD and CAD).

Results: Nodules were detected in 215/2303 subjects (dominant nodule: 171/215 NSN and 44/215 PSN), notably 149 were CAD-only detected (113 NSN and 36 PSN), 27 were VD-only detected (25 NSN and 2 PSN), and 39 were CAD and VD detected (33 NSN and 6 PSN). The agreement was fair (weighted k=0.276). Sensitivity and NPV for CAD 87.4\% and 98.7\%, and for VD 30.7\% and 93.3\%. Automatic and manual caliper were similar for the assessment of maximum diameter (p=0.111). CAD-only and VD-only detected nodules showed similar nodule diameter (p=0.727) and proportion of PSN (p=0.073). Volume of CAD-only detected nodules was significantly smaller (p=0.019). Among the 27 VD-only detected nodules, 11 NSN were subsequently detected by CAD at the incidence rounds. Conclusion: Detection of NSN and PSN showed only fair agreement between VD and CAD. Combined assessment of LDCT by both VD and CAD is needed to achieve optimal sensitivity.},

Results: Nodules were detected in 215/2303 subjects (dominant nodule: 171/215 NSN and 44/215 PSN), notably 149 were CAD-only detected (113 NSN and 36 PSN), 27 were VD-only detected (25 NSN and 2 PSN), and 39 were CAD and VD detected (33 NSN and 6 PSN). The agreement was fair (weighted k=0.276 95\%CI 0.203-0.350). Sensitivity and NPV for CAD 87.4\% and 98.7\%, and for VD 30.7\% and 93.3\%. Automatic and manual caliper were similar for the assessment of maximum diameter (p=0.111). CAD-only and VD-only detected nodules showed similar nodule diameter (p=0.727) and proportion of PSN (p=0.073). Volume of CAD-only detected nodules was significantly smaller (p=0.019). Among the 27 VD-only detected nodules, 11 NSN were subsequently detected by CAD at the incidence rounds. Conclusion: The detection of NSN and PSN showed only fair agreement between VD and CAD. Combined assessment of LDCT by both VD and CAD is needed to achieve the optimal sensitivity.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and visual reading for the detection of subsolid nodules (SSNs) in volumetrl measuremic low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer screening. Prospective visual detection (VD) and manuaent of SSN were performed in the 2303 baseline volumetric LDCTs of the Multicenter Italian Lung Detection trial. Baseline and 2- and 4-year LDCTs underwent retrospective CAD analysis, subsequently reviewed by 2 experienced thoracic radiologists. The reference standard was defined by the cumulative number of SSNs detected by any reading method between VD and CAD. The number of false-positive CAD marks per scan (FP/scan) was calculated. The positive predictive value of CAD was quantified per nodule (PPV) and per screenee (PPV). The sensitivity and negative predictive value were compared between CAD and VD. The longitudinal 3-time-point sensitivity of CAD was calculated in the subgroup of persistent SSNs seen by VD (ratio between the prevalent SSNs detected by CAD through 3 time points and the total number of persistent prevalent SSNs detected by VD) to test the sensitivity of iterated CAD analysis during a screening program. Semiautomatic characteristics (diameter, volume, and mass; both for whole nodule and solid component) were compared between SSN detected CAD-only or VD-only to investigate whether either reading method could suffer from specific sensitivity weakness related to SSN features. Semiautomatic and manual diameters were compared using Spearman ? correlation and Bland-Altman plot. Computer-aided diagnosis and VD detected a total of 194 SSNs in 6.7% (155/2,303) of screenees at baseline LDCT. The CAD showed mean FP/scan of 0.26 (604/2,303); PPV 22.5% (175/779) for any SSN, with 54.4% (37/68) for PSN and 19.4% for NSN (138/711; P < 0.001); PPV 25.6% (137/536). The sensitivity of CAD was superior to that of VD (88.4% and 34.2%, P < 0.001), as well as negative predictive value (99.2% and 95.5%, P < 0.001). The longitudinal 3-time-point sensitivity of CAD was 87.5% (42/48). There was no influence of semiautomatic characteristics on the performance of either reading method. The diameter of the solid component in PSN was larger by CAD compared with manual measurement. At baseline, CAD detected 3 of 4 SSNs, which were first overlooked by VD and subsequently evolved to lung cancer. Computer-aided diagnosis and VD as concurrent reading methods showed complementary performance, with CAD having a higher sensitivity, especially for PSN, but requiring visual confirmation to reduce false-positive calls. Computer-aided diagnosis and VD should be jointly used for LDCT reading to reduce false-negatives of either lone method. The semiautomatic measurement of solid core showed systematic shift toward a larger diameter, potentially resulting in an up-shift within Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System classification.},

  abstract = {Lung cancer presenting as subsolid nodule (SSN) can show slow growth, hence treating SSN is controversial. Our aim was to determine the long-term outcome of subjects with unresected SSNs in lung cancer screening. Since 2005, the Multicenter Italian Lung Detection (MILD) screening trial implemented active surveillance for persistent SSN, as opposed to early resection. Presence of SSNs was related to diagnosis of cancer at the site of SSN, elsewhere in the lung or in the body. The risk of overall mortality and lung cancer mortality was tested by Cox proportional hazards model. SSN were found in 16.9% (389/2,303) of screenees. During 9.3+-1.2 years of follow-up, the hazard ratio (HR) of lung cancer diagnosis in subjects with SSN was 6.77 (95%CI:3.39-13.54), with 73% (22/30) of cancers not arising from SSN (median time to diagnosis 52 months from SSN). Lung cancer-specific mortality in subjects with SSN was significantly increased (HR 3.80; 95%CI:1.24-11.65) compared to subjects without lung nodules. Lung cancer arising from SSN did not lead to death within the follow-up period. Subjects with SSN in the MILD cohort showed a high risk of developing lung cancer elsewhere in the lung, with only a minority of cases arising from SSN, and never representing the cause of death. These results demonstrate the safety of active surveillance for conservative management of SSN until signs of solid component growth, and the need for prolonged follow-up because of high risk of other cancers.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To calculate the risk of lung cancer (LC) in 1 and 3 years after baseline low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), in screenees selected by National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) criteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: For the aim of this post-hoc analysis, screenees from a prospective lung cancer screening (LCS) trial were retrospectively selected: age>=55years, pack-years>=30. Pre-test metrics: baseline demographics, medical interview, and pulmonary function test. Post-test metrics: retrospective LDCT reading by FDA-approved workstation for LCS, featuring computer aided diagnosis (CAD) and advanced semi-automatic algorithm for volumetric segmentation of nodule. Solid nodules were classified into 3 categories: 1)no nodule or nodule 1-112mm^3; 2)nodule 113-260mm^3; 3)nodule>260mm^3. Subsolid nodules were assigned either category 2(non-solid or part-solid nodules with solid component>5mm) or category 3(solid component>=5mm). The highest category was used for screenee-wise risk assessment. The primary outcome was LC diagnosis at 1 year or 3 years; the secondary outcome was the stage of LC. The Chi squared test was used to test the association between metrics and the primary outcome at 1 or 3 years. The risk of LC in 1 or 3 years was calculated by univariate and multivariate models. RESULTS: In 1,248 NLST-eligible screenees, LC frequency was 1.2% at 1 year and 2.3% at 3 years. At 1 year, category 3 was the only predictor of LC risk in multivariate model (odds ratio 79.84 p<0.001), confirming that early follow up by LDCT (e.g.3months) is needed for characterisation of such nodules. At 3 years, LC risk was predicted by category 2 (OR5.99 p=0.009) and 3 (OR26.55 p<001), Tiffeneau<70% (OR 2.75 p=0.024). LCS simulation with triennial screening rounds for category 1 and selective annual round for category 2 and 3 (29% in our population) showed 35% reduction of LDCT through 3 years. CONCLUSION: Annual LCS could be selectively offered to 30% of NLST eligible screenees, while longer interval might be safe in those with category 1. Validation of volumetric thresholds is granted through multiple software vendors. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: LCS strategy can be optimised by tailoring annual LDCT to a minority of subjects at high risk, while longer screening intervals could be a safe strategy for low risk subjects yielding substantial reduction of LDCT burden (radiation and cost). This model is being prospectively tested in a LCS trial with LDCT every 3 years},

  abstract = {PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To calculate the risk of lung cancer (LC) in 1 year and 3 years after baseline low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in high-risk subjects selected by the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) criteria. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Subjects from the Multicentric Italian Lung Detection (MILD) trial were selected according to NLST criteria: age >=55 years and pack-years >=30. Baseline characteristics were: smoking status (former/current), gender, percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV 1% pred, 90% threshold), Tiffeneau ratio (70% threshold), nodules at baseline LDCT. The risk of LC in 1 and 3 years was calculated by multivariate models. RESULTS: In 1,248 NLST eligible screenees, LC frequency was 1.2% at 1year, 2.6% at 3 years. At 1 year, nodule volume on LDCT was the only predictor of LC risk (volume >250mm3, odds ratio (OR) 34.25, p=0.0009). At 3 years, the risk of LC was predicted by: nodule volume 113-250 mm3 (OR9.52 p=0.01), nodule volume >250mm3 (OR29.07, p<0.001), Tiffeneau <=70% (OR2.08 p=0.0195). A simulation of triennial screening rounds, with selective annual round only for nodule volume >=113mm3 (19,9% in our population) showed 40% reduction of LDTC through 3 years, and 80% LDCT saving at each annual round. CONCLUSION: Annual round is worthwhile for nodule >=113mm3 (about 20% in our population). Screening every 3 years can safely reduce the LDCT burden for nodule <113mm3 (about 80% in our population).},

  title = {Patient variables related to false predictions of deep-learning assisted prostate cancer detection in MRI},
  abstract = {Background:
  DL-CAD for prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in mpMRI is developed to aid radiologists in PI-RADS evaluation. DL-CAD predictions have low accuracy, possibly due to clinical risk factors of csPCa that are not taken into account by DL-CAD.

  Purpose:
  Aim is to identify patient subgroups of clinical characteristics in which DL-CAD predictions differ from radiologists.

  Methods:
  DL-CAD was applied to a test cohort of men examined for PCa according to PI-RADSv2 between 2016 and 2017. Ground truth was provided by manually annotated PI-RADS >=4 lesions. Patient age and PSA were derived from the electronic patient record and other variables were mined from the written radiological reports. False and correct predicted patients were compared on variable distributions and false positive rates were compared between variable categories.

  Results:
  CsPCa was predicted for a total of 482 men (36.9% PIRADS >=4). Benign and malignant patients statistically differed on all clinical variables (P<.05). DL-CAD negative predictive value and positive predictive value were 0.912 and 0.457, respectively. False and correct positive predicted patients significantly differed on age (P<.05), PSA (P<.001), and PSAD (P<.001) as well as prostate volume (P<.001), number of lesions (P<.001), and number of affected zones (P<.001). Analysis of negative predictions was inconclusive due to small population size.

  Conclusions:
  False positive DL-CAD csPCa predictions are due to unavailable clinical variables that are used in radiologists' PI-RADS risk assessment. We advise to study the effect of including age, PSA and PSAD information in DL-CAD input on prediction accuracy.},

  title = {Tumor heterogeneity as a PET-biomarker predicts overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients},
  abstract = {INTRODUCTION
                             Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) shows a 5-year survival rate of 8%[1]. This mortality results from a lack of methods to accurately treat patients[2]. PDAC is remarkable for its fibrotic reaction, which is present at early stages of PDAC development[3]. Components of this environment can be measured on clinical images[4]. PET derived parameters, e.g. SUVmax, have not been able to provide prognostic information. In this study we developed an algorithm based on FDG-PET texture features (TF) that classifies heterogeneous or homogeneous tumors and shows a correlation with overall survival.


                             METHODS
                             In total, 121 patients with histologically proven PDAC who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT (Siemens Biograph mCT, Knoxville, US) were selected from the hospital system. Eighty-six EANM reconstructed scans were visually labeled as 'homogenous' or 'heterogeneous' by experienced Nuclear Medicine physicians and served as training set to develop the classifier [5]. All the 121 scans were used as validation set for the correlation with overall survival (OS). Tumors were delineated using 40% threshold of the SUVmax with manual correction. TF were extracted using the PyRadiomcis toolbox [6]. TF were selected and tested for robustness as described in literature [7-9]. The classifier was build using logistic regression. Prognostic impact was assessed by Kaplan Meier survival analysis and log-rank test.


                             RESULTS
                             Optimal performance of the leave-one-out cross-validation classifier in the training set yielded an accuracy of 0.73 and AUC of 0.71 in classifying PDAC as heterogeneous or homogeneous tumors. Of note, two tumors were visually labeled as homogenous but correctly classifier as heterogeneous by the classifier after review. For the 121 patients the OS of PDAC tumors classified as heterogeneous, was significantly worse than for homogeneous tumors; median OS 69 weeks (95%CI 64 to 91 weeks) versus median 95 weeks (95%CI 76 to 114), p= 0.0285). This is in contrast with single standard PET parameters, single TF or manual labeling, which had no significant prognostic impact.


                             CONCLUSIONS
                             We developed an algorithm that accurately classifies PDAC as heterogeneous or homogeneous, based on a set of 18F-FDG PET derived texture features. We showed that the classification result has prognostic value, improving upon standard PET derived parameters and single texture-features. Further validation of this algorithm in an external cohort of PDAC patients is ongoing.

  abstract = {Purpose: To develop and test a method for the reconstruction of cerebral Computed Tomography (CT) Angiography (CTA) from CT Perfusion data that, with respect to image quality, can substitute for conventional CTA. Method and materials: We propose the temporal Maximum Intensity Projection (tMIP) with prior temporal Guassian filtering as a technique to obtain angiography from CT Perfusion data (perfusion derived CTA, p-CTA). The amount of temporal filtering was evaluated to optimize Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) in the Circle of Willis (CoW). No spatial filtering was applied. We retrospectively selected 25 consecutive stroke patients who underwent CTP (80 kV, 150 mAs, 25 scans every 2s) and CTA (120 kV, 150 mAs) both with 128 x 0.625 mm collimation. Arterial enhancement was measured in 10 regions of interest (ROI) in the CoW (5 large and 5 small arteries) and image noise in one occipital lobe for perfusion derived CTA (p-CTA), standard tMIP, arterial phase of CTP (a-CTP) and conventional CTA. Results: Optimal CNR in the CoW was obtained at a temporal Gaussian filter strength of 2 seconds and was equal for both large and small arteries. The p-CTA resulted in an average CNR increase of 12% and a noise reduction of 25% compared to standard tMIP. The optimal filter strength was equal for both large and small vessels in the circle of Willis, and for comprised a Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of 2 seconds. The p-CTA was superior to conventional CTA with 23% higher CNR and 42% lower noise and to a-CTP with 42% higher CNR and 119% noise reduction. Conclusion: The presented method is an excellent technique to obtain CT Angiography from CT Perfusion data and renders CTA images with CNR and SNR superior to conventional CTA of the brain. Clinical relevance/application: Obtaining high quality CT Angiography (CTA) from noisy CT Perfusion (CTP) data could obviate an additional CTA scan, reduce total radiation exposure and the amount of contrast material needed.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was waived for this retrospective study, which included 25 consecutive patients who had had a stroke. We created temporal maximum intensity projection (tMIP) CT angiographic images by using prior temporal filtering as a timing-insensitive technique to produce CT angiographic images from CT perfusion data. The temporal filter strength was optimized to gain maximal contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) in the circle of Willis. The resulting timing-invariant (TI) CT angiography was compared with standard helical CT angiography, the arterial phase of dynamic CT angiography, and nonfiltered tMIP CT angiography. Vascular contrast, image noise, and CNR were measured. Four experienced observers scored all images for vascular noise, vascular contour, detail of small and medium arteries, venous superimposition, and overall image quality in a blinded side-by-side comparison. Measurements were compared with a paired t test; P = .05 indicated a significant difference. RESULTS: On average, optimized temporal filtering in TI CT angiography increased CNR by 18\% and decreased image noise by 18\% at the expense of a decrease in vascular contrast of 3\% when compared with nonfiltered tMIP CT angiography. CNR, image noise, vascular noise, vascular contour, detail visibility of small and medium arteries, and overall image quality of TI CT angiograms were superior to those of standard CT angiography, tMIP CT angiography, and the arterial phase of dynamic CT angiography at a vascular contrast that was similar to that of standard CT angiography. Venous superimposition was similar for all techniques. Image quality of the arterial phase of dynamic CT angiography was rated inferior to that of standard CT angiography. CONCLUSION: TI CT angiographic images constructed by using temporally filtered tMIP CT angiographic data have excellent image quality that is superior to that achieved with currently used techniques, but they suffer from modest venous superimposition.A-A?A 1/2  RSNA, 2012.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of timing-invariant CT angiography (TI-CTA) that is derived from CT perfusion (CTP) data for acute ischemic stroke assessment. METHOD AND MATERIALS: We selected 73 consecutive patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke. Standard CT angiography (CTA) and CT perfusion images were obtained at admission, and timing-invariant CTA was automatically derived from the CTP data. Two experienced radiologists were individually presented with a blinded and randomized sequence of scans. All images were scored for the presence of occlusion in the following artery segments: internal carotid artery (ICA), middle cerebral artery (MCA) segment 1 (M1) and trifurcation to segment 2 (M2), anterior cerebral artery segments 1 (A1) and 2 (A2), basilar artery (BA), posterior cerebral artery segments 1 (P1) and 2 (P2). Sensitivity and specificity of timing-invariant CTA were determined relative to standard CTA (unanimous occlusions). RESULTS: Timing-invariant CTA provided high sensitivity and specificity for arterial occlusion assessment. Specificity per segment was: ICA: 99%, A1: 98%, A2: 100%, M1: 96%, M2: 98%, BA: 100%, P1: 100%, P2: 100%. Sensitivity per segment was: ICA: 88%, M1: 94% and M2: 89%. Sensitivity could not be calculated for the other segments since those had two or less occlusions. There was one false negative score in the ICA that was missed by one observer only, the false negatives in the MCA were never solitary occlusions but were assigned to other MCA segments. CONCLUSION: Timing-invariant CTA that is derived from CT perfusion data provides a diagnostic accuracy that is similar to standard CTA. These findings suggest that a separate cerebral CTA scan can be omitted if CT perfusion imaging is performed. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: If CT perfusion has been performed, a separate standard CTA of the brain can be omitted, thereby reducing the total radiation dose and the amount of contrast material needed.},

We postulate that in these cases collateral vessels are present though not visible on standard imaging techniques that are based on a single time frame. METHODS: This study included 40 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke with a large-vessel occlusion. Standard computed tomography angiography (CTA, single time frame) and CT perfusion (multiple time frames) were obtained at admission and timing-invariant (TI)-CTA was created from the CT perfusion data. Clinical outcome data (modified Rankin Scale) were assessed at 3-month follow-up. Four experienced observers independently assessed collateral status twice on both standard CTA and TI-CTA in an independent, blinded, randomized manner. Collateral status was rated as good if AC/aEURdegAY=50\% and poor if <50\% of collaterals were present compared with the contralateral hemisphere. RESULTS: Collateral status was rated higher on TI-CTA (good in 84\%) compared with standard CTA (good in 49\%; P<0.001). Thirty-one percent of patients with poor collateral status on standard CTA still had good clinical outcome. All of those patients, however, showed good collaterals on TI-CTA. All cases with poor collateral status rated on TI-CTA had poor clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Collateral vessels may not always be visible on standard single time-frame CTA because of delayed contrast arrival. Future prognostic studies in acute stroke should consider delay-insensitive techniques, such as TI-CTA, instead of standard single time-frame imaging, such as standard CTA.},

We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of timing-invariant CTA for detecting intracranial artery occlusion in acute ischemic stroke, to examine whether standard CTA can be omitted.Patients with suspected ischemic stroke were prospectively enrolled and underwent CTA and CTP imaging at admission. Timing-invariant CTA was derived from the CTP data. Five neuroradiologic observers assessed all images for the presence and location of intracranial artery occlusion in a blinded and randomized manner. Sensitivity and specificity of timing-invariant CTA and standard CTA were calculated by using an independent expert panel as the reference standard. Interrater agreement was determined by using AZAo statistics.We included 108 patients with 47 vessel occlusions. Overall, standard CTA and timing-invariant CTA provided similar high diagnostic accuracy for occlusion detection with a sensitivity of 96\% (95\% CI, 90\%-100\%) and a specificity of 100\% (99\%-100\%) for standard CTA and a sensitivity of 98\% (95\% CI, 94\%-100\%) and a specificity of 100\% (95\% CI, 100\%-100\%) for timing-invariant CTA. For proximal large-vessel occlusions, defined as occlusions of the ICA, basilar artery, and M1, the sensitivity and specificity were 100\% (95\% CI, 100\%-100\%) for both techniques. Interrater agreement was good for both techniques (mean AZAo value, 0.75 and 0.76).Timing-invariant CTA derived from CTP data provides diagnostic accuracy similar to that of standard CTA for the detection of artery occlusions in acute stroke.},

Because CTA is a snapshot of arterial contrast enhancement, information on flow dynamics is limited. Dynamic CTA techniques, also referred to as 4D-CTA, have become available for clinical practice in recent years. This article provides a description of 4D-CTA techniques and a review of the available literature on the application of 4D-CTA for the evaluation of intracranial vascular malformations and hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. Most of the research performed to date consists of observational cohort studies or descriptive case series. These studies show that intracranial vascular malformations can be adequately depicted and classified by 4D-CTA, with DSA as the reference standard. In ischemic stroke, 4D-CTA better estimates thrombus burden and the presence of collateral vessels than conventional CTA. In intracranial hemorrhage, 4D-CTA improves the detection of the "spot? sign, which represents active ongoing bleeding.},

  abstract = {Without image processing, the dynamic range of display systems is too small to optimally display both the interior and the peripheral zone of a compressed breast. To overcome manual adjustment of contrast, we propose an algorithm for peripheral enhancement of digital or digitized mammograms. This is done by virtually adding homogeneous tissue at the peripheral zone, where the breast comes loose from the compression paddle. The gradual signal increase due to a smaller breast thickness near the breast edge is estimated by the solution of the anisotropic diffusion equation. The conductivity is set small in the direction perpendicular to the breast edge, and large in the parallel direction. By this, large conductivities (much blurring) can be applied, while undesirable artifacts that would be caused by isotropic filtering are minimized. This measure is not always enough to prevent some reduction of relevant contrast. Therefore, dense tissue along parallel curves to the breast edge is interpolated before smoothing the image. Anisotropic diffusion filtering and dense tissue interpolation are both new techniques to improve peripheral enhancement. Comparison with some other methods showed that our approach performs at least as good as other methods.},

The CAD system was tested by fivefold cross validation on a publicly available database. The results were evaluated by a free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis (FROC). It was found that the performance of the CAD system trained with simulated nodules comes close to the performance of state of the art CAD systems that are trained with real nodules.

  abstract = {Generative adversarial networks have been successfully applied to inpainting in natural images. However, the current state-of-the-art models have not yet been widely adopted in the medical imaging domain. In this paper, we investigate the performance of three recently published deep learning based inpainting models: context encoders, semantic image inpainting, and the contextual attention model, applied to chest x-rays, as the chest exam is the most commonly performed radiological procedure. We train these generative models on 1.2M 128 $\times$ 128 patches from 60K healthy x-rays, and learn to predict the center 64 $\times$ 64 region in each patch. We test the models on both the healthy and abnormal radiographs. We evaluate the results by visual inspection and comparing the PSNR scores. The outputs of the models are in most cases highly realistic. We show that the methods have potential to enhance and detect abnormalities. In addition, we perform a 2AFC observer study and show that an experienced human observer performs poorly in detecting inpainted regions, particularly those generated by the contextual attention model.},

  abstract = {In this study, we investigate the detection of cardiomegaly on frontal chest radiographs through two alternative deep-learning approaches - via anatomical segmentation and via image-level classification. We used the publicly available ChestX-ray14 dataset, and obtained heart and lung segmentation annotations for 778 chest radiographs for the development of the segmentation-based approach. The classification-based method was trained with 65k standard chest radiographs with image-level labels. For both approaches, the best models were found through hyperparameter searches where architectural, learning, and regularization related parameters were optimized systematically. The resulting models were tested on a set of 367 held-out images for which cardiomegaly annotations were hand-labeled by two independent expert radiologists. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. The performance of the segmentation-based system with an AUC of 0.977 is significantly better for classifying cardiomegaly than the classification-based model which achieved an AUC of 0.941. Only the segmentation-based model achieved comparable performance to an independent expert reader (AUC of 0.978). We conclude that the segmentation-based model requires 100 times fewer annotated chest radiographs to achieve a substantially better performance, while also producing more interpretable results.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Total lung volume is an important quantitative biomarker and is used for the assessment of restrictive lung diseases.
   PURPOSE: In this study, we investigate the performance of several deep-learning approaches for automated measurement of total lung volume from chest radiographs.
   METHODS: About 7621 posteroanterior and lateral view chest radiographs (CXR) were collected from patients with chest CT available. Similarly, 928 CXR studies were chosen from patients with pulmonary function test (PFT) results. The reference total lung volume was calculated from lung segmentation on CT or PFT data, respectively. This dataset was used to train deep-learning architectures to predict total lung volume from chest radiographs. The experiments were constructed in a stepwise fashion with increasing complexity to demonstrate the effect of training with CT-derived labels only and the sources of error. The optimal models were tested on 291 CXR studies with reference lung volume obtained from PFT. Mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) were computed.
   RESULTS: The optimal deep-learning regression model showed an MAE of 408 ml and an MAPE of 8.1\% using both frontal and lateral chest radiographs as input. The predictions were highly correlated with the reference standard (Pearson's r = 0.92). CT-derived labels were useful for pretraining but the optimal performance was obtained by fine-tuning the network with PFT-derived labels.
   CONCLUSION: We demonstrate, for the first time, that state-of-the-art deep-learning solutions can accurately measure total lung volume from plain chest radiographs. The proposed model is made publicly available and can be used to obtain total lung volume from routinely acquired chest radiographs at no additional cost. This deep-learning system can be a useful tool to identify trends over time in patients referred regularly for chest X-ray.},

  abstract = {To determine whether density mapping (DM) is more accurate for detection and quantification of pathologic air trapping (pAT) in patients after lung transplantation compared to other CT air trapping measures. One-hundred forty-seven lung and heart-lung transplant recipients underwent CT-examinations at functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity (TLC) and PFT six months after lung transplantation. Quantification of air trapping was performed with the threshold-based method in expiration (EXP), density mapping (DM) and the expiratory to inspiratory ratio of the mean lung density (E/I-ratio MLD). A non-rigid registration of inspiration-expiration CT-data with a following voxel-to-voxel mapping was carried out for DM. Systematic variation of attenuation ranges was performed for EXP and DM and correlated with the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/TLC) by Spearman rank correlation test. AT was considered pathologic if RV/TLC was above the 95th percentile of the predicted upper limit of normal values. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. The optimal attenuation range for the EXP method was from -790 HU to -950 HU (EXP-790 to -950HU) (r = 0.524, p<0.001) to detect air trapping. Within the segmented lung parenchyma, AT was best defined as voxel difference less than 80 HU between expiration and registered inspiration using the DM method. DM correlated best with RV/TLC (r = 0.663, p<0.001). DM and E/I-ratio MLD showed a larger AUC (0.78; 95\% CI 0.69-0.86; 0.76, 95\% CI 0.67-0.85) than EXP -790 HU to -950 HU (0.71, 95\% CI 0.63-0.78). DM and E/I-ratio MLD showed better correlation with RV/TLC and are more suited quantitative CT-methods to detect pAT in lung transplant patients than the EXP-790HU to -950HU.},

  abstract = {Deep learning systems are increasingly being researched for the development of Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) of lung nodules in lung cancer screening. In order to achieve clinically relevant accuracy, these supervised deep learning systems rely on large amounts of annotated data. However, the availability of labels in medical imaging is rather limited due to the costs involved in obtaining annotations from expert clinicians. To compensate for this data scarcity, the synthesis of additional training data by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has gained increased attention and has shown to be useful for the improvement of several supervised learning tasks. This study compares multiple advanced training methods involving synthesized data from a multi-conditional-Wasserstein-GAN (mcWGAN) to improve a nodule malignancy classifier. It specifically examines the potential of a mcWGAN to generate synthetic nodules that are hard-to-classify through input conditions from misclassified nodules. This approach was compared with conventional nodule synthesis, where the input conditions are sampled from the distributions of all nodules, rather than the misclassified nodules solely. We examined whether the use of pre-training on synthesized nodules or ImageNet further improves the classifier's performance. The proposed mcWGAN proved to be successful at generating a wide variety of additional training data with manipulable malignancy and nodule diameter attributes. We show that ImageNet pre-training, combined with synthetic data augmentation, consistently outperforms other training approaches.},

We performed a non-blinded validation of ex-vivo 7T MR to detect the tongue squamous cell carcinoma and resection margin in 10 fresh tongue specimens using histopathology as gold standard. In six of seven specimens with a histopathologically determined invasion depth of the tumor of [Formula: see text] mm, the tumor could be recognized on MR, with a resection margin within a 2 mm range as compared to histopathology. In three specimens with an invasion depth of [Formula: see text] mm, the tumor was not visible on MR. Technical limitations mainly included scan time, image resolution, and the fact that we used a less available small-bore 7T MR machine. Ex-vivo 7T probably will have a low negative predictive value but a high positive predictive value, meaning that in tumors thicker than a few millimeters we expect to be able to predict whether the resection margin is too small. A randomized controlled trial needs to be performed to show our hypothesis: better oncologic and functional outcomes, better quality of life, and lower costs.},

  booktitle = {International workshop and conference on human reflexes: wiring and firing of motoneurons},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {In the study of corticospinal communication, the conceptual mechanism called communication through coherence (CTC, Fries, 2005) gets increasing support by experimental evidence. The concept comprises the assumption that neuronal groups communicate through coherent oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands roughly in the range between 10 - 80 Hz, divided in alpha-, the beta- and the gamma-band. Especially when corticospinal interaction gives support to the CTC principle, this is regarded as strong evidence (Van Elswijk, 2007). An interesting question for the corticospinal tract is how centrally evoked oscillatory phenomena are translated by the alpha-motoneuron pool into motoneuron activity. Thereby, the properties of the alpha-motoneuron, especially its long afterhyperpolarized (AHP) phase, are utmost relevant in signal transmission. A number of authors have already looked into such spinal transmission and motor neuron firing patterns (e.g. Farina et al., 2004; Meyers et al., 2007; Williams and Baker, 2009). Three different types frequencies or better frequency bands play a role in the discussion. First, there is a specific alpha-, beta-, or gamma-frequency band in which the corticospinal interaction apparently occurs (the 1st frequency). Since frequencies in these bands are in the order of the firing frequencies of motor neurons (the 2nd frequency), attempts are made to interpret the couplings in the 1st frequency directly from this 2nd one. We will elucidate that for a proper understanding these have to be separated conceptually. And then the frequency content of the involved electrophysiological signals (EEG, MEG, EMG; the 3rd frequency) plays a role. They lead for instance to a regular question whether and why the EMG signal should be rectified before a coherence analysis is done, a question hardly ever posed for the EEG signal. By using a model for corticospinal transmission (Kleine et al., 2001, Matthews. 1996), we investigated the effectiveness and the properties of oscillatory central drive transmission to the muscle, its relation with the firing patterns of the alpha-motoneurons, the mutual interaction of those firing patterns, and the consequences for especially the surface EMG signal. In this attempt, we clearly distinguish the three frequency bands involved from the beginning to avoid confusion.},

METHODS: We describe a model for the simulation of alpha-motoneuron firing and the EMG signal as response to central drive input. The transfer in the frequency domain is investigated. Coherence between stochastical central input and EMG is also evaluated. RESULTS: The transmission of central rhythmicities to the EMG signal relates to the spectral content of the latter. Coherence between central input to the alpha-motoneuron pool and the EMG signal is significant whereby the coupling strength hardly depends on the frequency in a range from 1 to 100 Hz. Common central input to pairs of alpha-motoneurons strongly increases the coherence levels. The often-used rectification of the EMG signal introduces a clear frequency dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Oscillatory phenomena are strongly transmitted via the alpha-motoneuron pool. The motoneuron firing frequencies do play a role in the transmission gain, but do not influence the coherence levels. Rectification of the EMG signal enhances the transmission gain, but lowers coherence and introduces a strong frequency dependency. We think that it should be avoided. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings show that rhythmicities are translated into alpha-motoneuron activity without strong non-linearities.},

  booktitle = {45th World Conference on Lung Health},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {Background: Recent studies have shown that computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of chest X-rays (CXR) allows the detection of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) with a performance similar to that of clinical officers. This study investigated the performance of the new CAD4TB system in a Tanzanian prison. Design/Methods: Between August 2013 and June 2014, all inmates of the Ukonga Prison, Dar es Salaam, are screened for TB. X-rays are classified as "normal", "abnormal, not suggestive of TB", "abnormal, consistent with TB", and "abnormal, highly suggestive of active TB" by an assistant medical officer with two years of training in radiology (reader A) and processed by the software CAD4TB v3.07 (Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Nijmegen University, The Netherlands). A subset of 517 consecutive images was re-evaluated by reader A, as well as by an independent clinical officer (reader B), and by a TB expert. The CXR findings of the TB expert, based on a case definition which included X-ray results either "consistent with TB" or "highly suggestive of active TB", determined the radiological reference that was used for CAD4TB and the two other readers. Results: On the 466 negative and 51 positive images, readers A and B performed with a sensitivity of 52.9% and 43.1%, and a specificity of 92.4% and 77.5%, respectively. CAD4TB performed significantly better than reader B, but not as good as reader A (AUC 0.751, e.g. sensitivity 52.9% and specificity 83.5% for a defined threshold). The intra-reader agreement of reader A was good (Cohen's i:31.80), but the agreement between A and B was low (13.36). Although all readers, including CAD4TB, analyzed every CXR in under two minutes, human readers delayed 10% of images by more than 20 hours during the screening. Conclusion: This first evaluation of CAD4TB in a real-world screening situation showed, in line with previous studies, that CAD4TB performs better than a clinical officer (B), but not as good as a more experienced X-ray reader (A). Moreover, the overall time to detection is kept predictably short, which is an important criterion in multistage screening algorithms.},

Tertairy lymphoid structures (TLS) have been found to indicate a positive patient prognosis, especially in combination with germinal centers (GC). Therefore, a VGG16-like network was trained to detect TLS and GC in histopathological slides of lung squamous cell carcinoma with F1 scores on the pixel level of 0.922 and 0.802 respectively. Performance on a different held-out test set on the object level was 0.640 and 0.500 for TLS and GC respectively.
   Treatment differs per growth pattern of lung adenocarcinoma and variability between pathol ogists in the assessment of lung adenocarcinoma exists. Therefore, a similar VGG16-like network was trained to segment growth patterns of adenocarcinoma in slides of lung tissue with F1 scores on the pixel level of 0.891, 0.524, 0.812 and 0.954 for solid adenocarcinoma, acinar adenocarcinoma, micropapillary adenocarcinoma and non-tumor tissue respectively.
   Because the previous system was only trained on sparsely annotated data and consequently did not encounter neighbouring growth patterns of lung adenocarcinoma, a method with genera tive adversarial networks to generate fake densely annotated realistic looking image patches from sparsely annotated data was examined and a comparison between three types of models was made.},

  abstract = {Purpose / Introduction
                             Prostate MRI finds 18% more clinically significant prostate cancer while avoiding 27% biopsies [1]. Reproducibility for multi-parametric T2+DWI+DCE
                             prostate MRI mpMRI is moderate [2] even though a PIRADS reading standard is available [3]. Quantification could help improve reproducibility, which to
                             some extent works for ADC. Scanner provided T2 maps are no solution as it leads to a different texture, lower spatial resolution and increased scan time.
                             We have previously developed a method for normalizing T2-weighted images [4]. The normalized value achieved a diagnostic accuracy AUC of 0.85
                             over 0.64 for the raw T2-weighted values. That method required a separate proton density weighted sequence, an exact knowledge of the sequence
                             model and one reference tissue region. We propose a new method using multiple reference tissues that does not require an additional sequence, nor
                             detailed knowledge about the sequence model. The recent development of deep learning makes it feasible to segment multiple reference tissues. The
                             hypothesis is that the reference tissues allow building a patient specific model to normalize the T2-weighted prostate MR images for quantitative use.
                             Subjects and Methods
                             To test the hypothesis we manually delineated reference tissues and tumor lesions in mpMRI studies of prostate cancer patients. All lesions were
                             interpreted by expert radiologists and assigned a PIRADS score. The normalized T2 was then validated for its ability to discriminate PIRADS 2-3 from 4-5
                             classes. Regions of interest ROI were drawn in four distinct tissue types in fifty T2-weighted images from regular multiparametric prostate MRI mpMRI.
                             The four reference tissue types were: obturator internus muscle, body fat, femoral head, bladder lumen. Four average ROI signals were computed per
                             patient. Each reference tissue was assigned a fixed reference value T2 relaxation found in literature. Per patient, a smooth spline model was fitted to the
                             average, reference pairs. The estimated spline model was then inverted to map patients' raw T2-weighted image scalar values to normalized values. The
                             effect of the normalization was determined by computing and comparing the diagnostic accuracy using ROC analysis.
                             Results
                             The area under the ROC AUC was significantly higher p<0.05 in normalized T2.5/22/2017 #542: Feasibility of multireference tissue normalization of T2weighted prostate MRI.

                             Discussion / Conclusion
                             The significant improvement of the diagnostic accuracy demonstrates the potential of our normalization method for the quantitative interpretation of T2-weighted prostate MRI. The results were similar to our previous method.The method still requires manual delineation of multiple reference tissues,
                             however, we will develop deep learning segmentation methods to automate the method and enable regular clinical use.

  abstract = {PURPOSE
                             To explore a novel multireferencetissue normalization method applied to t2weighted prostate MRI.
                             METHOD AND MATERIALS
                             Assuming the availability of a set of distinct reference tissue segmentations, the hypothesis is that it allows computing a patient specific sequence model
                             that can normalize MRI. The normalization should produce similar scalar values in the same reference regions for different patients/scanners/sequences
                             and interpolate in between reference values for other tissue areas. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn in four distinct tissue types in a cohort of sixtyfive t2weighted images from regular multiparametric prostate MRI (mpMRI). The four reference tissue types were: skeletal muscle, body fat, femur
                             head, bladder lumen. Four average ROI signals were computed per patient. Each reference tissue was assigned a fixed reference value (t2 relaxation
                             found in literature). Per patient, a smooth sequence model was fitted to the (average, reference) pairs. The estimated sequence model was then
                             inverted to map patients' raw t2weighted image scalar values to normalized values. To test the method, the effect of normalization on observed
                             variance and tissue discriminability was analyzed. A leaveoneout experiment was performed in which for each ROI its normalized value was computed
                             using the sequence model estimate using the three remaining reference ROIs. The difference between original t2weighted and normalized scalar MRI
                             was analyzed by means of variability and ROC analysis.
                             RESULTS
                             Multireferencetissue normalization significantly (p<0.05) decreased variability and increased the area under the ROC curve for discriminating each
                             reference tissue combination. The ROC curves in the figure show the effect of the normalization (T2n) on the discrimination between body fat and
                             femur head tissue.
                             CONCLUSION
                             Semiautomatic multireferencetissue normalization shows reduced interpatient variability and may allow better quantitative discrimination between
                             tissue types.
                             CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION
                             Multireferencetissue t2weighted MRI normalization seems feasible. In combination with automatic segmentation, this could be providing clinical
                             quantitative imaging support to mpMRI diagnosis of prostate cancer. This result motivates us to continue to explore the ability of this novel method to
                             help detect and discriminate prostate cancer in mpMR},

  abstract = {Although breast cancer screening is recommended to start at a younger age for women with a hereditary risk of breast cancer, the sensitivity of mammography for these women is reduced. We compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with mammography to determine which is more sensitive and whether MRI could play a role in the early detection of breast cancer for these women.We constructed a retrospective cohort of all breast MRI and mammography surveillance reports made in our department from November 1994 to February 2001. All of the 179 women in the cohort had received biannual palpation in addition to annual imaging by MRI, mammography, or both. The 258 MRI images and the 262 mammograms were classified with the use of the BI-RADS (i.e., Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) scoring system, which has five categories to indicate the level of suspicion of a lesion. Receiver operator characteristic curves were generated for MRI and mammography, and the area under each curve (AUC) was assessed for the entire cohort of 179 women and for a subset of 75 women who had received both an MRI and a mammographic examination within a 4-month period. All statistical tests were two-sided.In the cohort of 179 women, we detected 13 breast cancers. Seven cancers were not revealed by mammography, but all were detected by MRI. For the entire cohort, the AUC for mammography was 0.74 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.68 to 0.79), and the AUC for MRI was 0.99 (95\% CI = 0.98 to 1.0). For the subset of women who had both examinations, the AUC for mammography was 0.70 (95\% CI = 0.60 to 0.80), and the AUC for MRI was 0.98 (95\% CI = 0.95 to 1.0).MRI was more accurate than mammography in annual breast cancer surveillance of women with a hereditary risk of breast cancer. Larger prospective studies to examine the role of MRI in screening programs are justified.},

  abstract = {This work covers research on the application of breast MRI and on computer aided diagnosis (CAD), aimed at improving the accuracy of the imaging interpretation. First, a study is described that was designed to answer whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to periodically examine women with a hereditary increased risk of breast cancer. MRI appeared more accurate than conventional mammography, when used in annual breast cancer surveillance of women with an increased hereditary risk of breast cancer. The thesis then describes the observer variability in reporting lesion features, including an approach to improve it. Surprisingly, a considerable variability was found in the use of most generally accepted terms. The preparation of a region of interest for analysis of contrast enhancement turned out to be a major source of variability in the interpretation of enhancement curves. Technological advances made it possible to run both very fast imaging series and slower, high-definition series, within the same breast MRI study. Such a hybrid set of series was used in a clinical study performed by us to determine if slow, fast or a combination of series would result in the best diagnostic performance. We concluded that a combination of series yielded the best results. Next is the description of a method for automated analysis of contrast enhancement in breast MRI (mean shift clustering followed by iterative selection of the region of interest) . Finally, an improvement of our CAD method is described. This thesis describes that: 1) Breast MRI can be used for periodical surveillance of women with hereditary increased risk of breast cancer; 2) Breast MRI suffers from limited specificity of breast MRI, partly caused by the inter-observer variability in the placement of the region of interest for pharmacokinetic analysis; 3) Our CAD method is a feasible technique to automatically place the region of interest and to obtain a probability of malignancy, especially if expanded with pharmacokinetic modeling.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate automatic characterization of a breast MR lesion by its spatially coherent region of interest (ROI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The method delineated 247 enhancing lesions using Otsu thresholding after manually placing a sphere. Mean Shift Clustering subdivided each volume, based on features including pharmacokinetic parameters. An iteratively trained classifier to predict the most suspicious ROI (IsR) was used, to predict the malignancy likelihood of each lesion. Performance was evaluated using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, and compared with a previous prototype. IsR was compared with noniterative training. The effect of adding BI-RADSA-A?A 1/2  morphology (from a radiologist) to the classifier was investigated. RESULTS: The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.83 (95\% confidence interval [CI] of 0.77-0.88), and was 0.75 (95\%CI = 0.68-0.81; P = 0.029) without pharmacokinetic features. IsR performed better than conventional selection, based on one feature (AUC 0.75, 95\%CI = 0.68-0.81; P = 0.035). With morphology, the AUC was 0.84 (95\%CI = 0.78-0.88) versus 0.82 without (P = 0.40). CONCLUSION: Breast lesions can be characterized by their most suspicious, contiguous ROI using multi-feature clustering and iterative training. Characterization was improved by including pharmacokinetic modeling, while in our experiments, including morphology did not improve characterization. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2012;.

  abstract = {Accurate diagnosis of melanocytic lesions is challenging, even for expert pathologists. Nowadays, whole-slide imaging (WSI) is used for routine clinical pathology diagnosis in several laboratories. One of the limitations of WSI, as it is most often used, is the lack of a multiplanar focusing option. In this study, we aim to establish the diagnostic accuracy of WSI for melanocytic lesions and investigate the potential accuracy increase of z-stack scanning. Z-stack enables pathologists to use a software focus adjustment, comparable to the fine-focus knob of a conventional light microscope. Melanocytic lesions (  = 102) were selected from our pathology archives: 35 nevi, 5 spitzoid tumors of unknown malignant potential, and 62 malignant melanomas, including 10 nevoid melanomas. All slides were scanned at a magnification comparable to use of a x40 objective, in z-stack mode. A ground truth diagnosis was established on the glass slides by four academic dermatopathologists with a special interest in the diagnosis of melanoma. Six nonacademic surgical pathologists subspecialized in dermatopathology examined the cases by WSI. An expert consensus diagnosis was achieved in 99 (97%) of cases. Concordance rates between surgical pathologists and the ground truth varied between 75% and 90%, excluding nevoid melanoma cases. Concordance rates of nevoid melanoma varied between 10% and 80%. Pathologists used the software focusing option in 7%-28% of cases, which in 1 case of nevoid melanoma resulted in correcting a misdiagnosis after finding a dermal mitosis. Diagnostic accuracy of melanocytic lesions based on glass slides and WSI is comparable with previous publications. A large variability in diagnostic accuracy of nevoid melanoma does exist. Our results show that z-stack scanning, in general, does not increase the diagnostic accuracy of melanocytic.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy have boosted the interest in the role played by the immune system in cancer treatment. In particular, the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have become a central research topic in oncology and pathology. Consequently, a method to automatically detect and quantify immune cells is of great interest. In this paper, we present a comparison of different deep learning (DL) techniques for the detection of lymphocytes in immunohistochemically stained (CD3 and CD8) slides of breast, prostate and colon cancer. The compared methods cover the state-of-the-art in object localization, classification and segmentation: Locality Sensitive Method (LSM), U-net, You Only Look Once (YOLO) and fully-convolutional networks (FCNN). A dataset with 109,841 annotated cells from 58 whole-slide images was used for this study. Overall, U-net and YOLO achieved the highest results, with an F1-score of 0.78 in regular tissue areas. U-net approach was more robust to biological and staining variability and could also handle staining and tissue artifacts.},

We have built a dataset of 171,166 manually annotated CD3  and CD8  cells, which we used to train deep learning algorithms for automatic detection of lymphocytes in histopathology images to better quantify immune response. Moreover, we investigate the effectiveness of four deep learning based methods when different subcompartments of the whole-slide image are considered: normal tissue areas, areas with immune cell clusters, and areas containing artifacts. We have compared the proposed methods in breast, colon and prostate cancer tissue slides collected from nine different medical centers. Finally, we report the results of an observer study on lymphocyte quantification, which involved four pathologists from different medical centers, and compare their performance with the automatic detection. The results give insights on the applicability of the proposed methods for clinical use. U-Net obtained the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.78 and the highest agreement with manual evaluation (k=0.72), whereas the average pathologists agreement with reference standard was k=0.64.

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of B-cell lymphoma. It is characterized by a heterogeneous morphology, genetic changes and clinical behavior. A small specific subgroup of DLBCL, harbouring a MYC gene translocation is associated with worse patient prognosis and outcome. Typically, the MYC translocation is assessed with a molecular test (FISH), that is expensive and time-consuming. Our hypothesis is that genetic changes, such as translocations could be visible as changes in the morphology of an HE-stained specimen. However, it has not proven possible to use morphological criteria for the detection of a MYC translocation in the diagnostic setting due to lack of specificity.
   In this paper, we apply a deep learning model to automate detection of the MYC translocations in DLBCL based on HE-stained specimens. The proposed method works at the whole-slide level and was developed based on a multicenter data cohort of 91 patients. All specimens were stained with HE, and the MYC translocation was confirmed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The system was evaluated on an additional 66 patients, and obtained AUROC of 0.83 and accuracy of 0.77. The proposed method presents proof of a concept giving insights in the applicability of deep learning methods for detection of a genetic changes in DLBCL. In future work we will evaluate our algorithm for automatic pre-screen of DLBCL specimens to obviate FISH analysis in a large number of patients.},

  abstract = {When diagnosing and reporting lung adenocarcinoma (LAC), pathologists currently include an assessment of histologic tumor growth patterns because the predominant growth pattern has been reported to impact prognosis. However, the subjective nature of manual slide evaluation contributes to suboptimal inter-pathologist variability in tumor growth pattern assessment. We applied a deep learning approach to identify and automatically delineate areas of four tumor growth patterns (solid, acinar, micropapillary, and cribriform) and non-tumor areas in whole-slide images (WSI) from resected LAC specimens. We trained a DenseNet model using patches from 109 slides collected at two institutions. The model was tested using 56 WSIs including 20 that were collected at a third institution. Using the same slide set, the concordance between the DenseNet model and an experienced pathologist (blinded to the DenseNet results) in determining the predominant tumor growth pattern was substantial(kappa score = 0.603). Using a subset of 36 test slides that were manually annotated for tumor growth patterns, we also measured the F1-score for each growth pattern: 0.95 (solid), 0.78 (acinar), 0.76 (micropapillary), 0.28 (cribriform) and 0.97 (non-tumor). Our results suggest that DenseNet assessment of WSIs with solid, acinar, and micropapillary predominant tumor growth is more robust than for the WSIs with predominant cribriform growth which are less frequently encountered.},

Models were developed on a multi-center cohort with 582 WSIs and subsequently evaluated on two independent test sets including 85 and 50 WSIs, respectively, to show the robustness of the proposed method to differing staining protocols and scanner types. We also investigated the application of normalization as a pre-processing step by two techniques, the whole-slide image color standardizer (WSICS) algorithm, and a cycle-GAN based method. For the two independent datasets we obtained an AUC of 0.92 and 0.83 respectively. After rescanning the AUC improves to 0.91/0.88 and after style normalization to 0.98/0.97. In the future our algorithm could be used to automatically pre-screen prostate biopsies to alleviate the workload of pathologists.},

  abstract = {In this study, we introduce a technique to generate synthetic histologic image data by blending parts of different images into a new image patch. The proposed approach, which we call multi-patch blending(MPB), crops parts of two histologic images of tumor growth patterns annotated with single but different labels and pastes them into a newly created image patch comprising areas with two different annotations. A Cycle-GAN model is employed in MPB to smooth out transitions between the pasted image crops and make the output image patch look realistic. The goal of implementing the MPB is to support the  task of semantic segmentation of lung adenocarcinoma grown patterns in whole-slide images (WSI). We used MPB to increase the number of training patches extracted from a set of 18 WSIs with sparse annotations. De facto, MPB was implemented as a novel data augmentation strategy. U-Net trained with MPB-generated patches achieved 13% higher F1-score than the U-Net trained with original (sparsely annotated) patches in a 4-classsemantic segmentation task.},

CT examinations were quantified for coronary artery calcium volume, pulmonary emphysema (perc15) and bronchial wall thickness (pi10). Data were analysed via a Cox proportional hazard analysis, net reclassification improvement (NRI) and C-indices.184 participants experienced a cardiovascular event during a median follow-up of 2.9 years.

The aim of this study is to compare the performance of nodule malignancy risk prediction tools using diameter or volume and between computer-aided detection (CAD) and radiologist measurements. Methods: Multivariable logistic regression models were prepared using data from two multi-center lung cancer screening trials. For model development and validation, baseline LDCT scans from the PanCan Study and a subset of National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) scans with lung nodule >=3 mm in mean diameter were analysed using the CIRRUS Lung Screening Workstation (Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands). In the NLST sample, nodules with cancer had been matched on size to nodules without cancer. Results: Both CAD-based mean diameter and volume models showed excellent discrimination and calibration, with similar areas under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves of 0.947. The two CAD models had similar predictive performance to the radiologist-based model. In NLST validation data, the CAD Mean Diameter and Volume models also demonstrated excellent discrimination: AUC's 0.810 and 0.821, respectively. These performance statistics are similar to the PanCan Malignancy Probability Model in these data using radiologist measured maximum diameter. Conclusion: Either CAD-based nodule diameter or volume can be used to assist in predicting nodule malignancy risk.},

  abstract = {In this paper we investigated classification of malignant and benign lesions in automated 3D breast ultrasound (ABUS). As a new imaging modality, ABUS overcomes the drawbacks of 2D hand-held ultrasound (US) such as its operator dependence and limited capability in visualizing the breast in 3D. The classification method we present includes a 3D lesion segmentation stage based on dynamic programming, which effectively deals with limited visibility of lesion boundaries due to shadowing and speckle. A novel aspect of ABUS imaging, in which the breast is compressed by means of a dedicated membrane, is the presence of spiculation in coronal planes perpendicular to the transducer. Spiculation patterns, or architectural distortion, are characteristic for malignant lesions. Therefore, we compute a spiculation measure in coronal planes and combine this with more traditional US features related to lesion shape, margin, posterior acoustic behavior, and echo pattern. However, in our work the latter features are defined in 3D. Classification experiments were performed with a dataset of 40 lesions including 20 cancers. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used in combination with leaveone- patient-out and feature selection in each training cycle. We found that spiculation and margin contrast were the most discriminative features and that these features were most often chosen during feature selection. An Az value of 0.86 was obtained by merging all features, while an Az value of 0.91 was obtained by feature selection.},

The technology has gained high interest and may become widely used in screening of dense breasts, where sensitivity of mammography is poor. ABUS has a high sensitivity for detecting solid breast lesions. However, reading ABUS images is time consuming, and subtle abnormalities may be missed. Therefore, we are developing a computer aided detection (CAD) system to help reduce reading time and errors. In the multi-stage system we propose, segmentations of the breast and nipple are performed, providing landmarks for the detection algorithm. Subsequently, voxel features characterizing coronal spiculation patterns, blobness, contrast, and locations with respect to landmarks are extracted. Using an ensemble of classifiers, a likelihood map indicating potential malignancies is computed. Local maxima in the likelihood map are determined using a local maxima detector and form a set of candidate lesions in each view. These candidates are further processed in a second detection stage, which includes region segmentation, feature extraction and a final classification. Region segmentation is performed using a 3D spiral-scanning dynamic programming method. Region features include descriptors of shape, acoustic behavior and texture. Performance was determined using a 78-patient dataset with 93 images, including 50 malignant lesions. We used 10-fold cross-validation.

We combine features describing the lesion location with respect to the nipple, the transducer and the chestwall, with features describing lesion properties such as intensity, spiculation, blobness, contrast and lesion likelihood. By using a grid search strategy, the location of the lesion was predicted in the target view. Our method achieved an error of 15.64 mmA,A+-16.13 mm.

Determining the location of the chest wall in automated 3D breast ultrasound images is necessary in computer-aided detection systems to remove automatically detected cancer candidates beyond the chest wall and it can be of great help for inter- and intra-modal image registration. We show that the visible part of the chest wall in an automated 3D breast ultrasound image can be accurately modeled by a cylinder. We fit the surface of our cylinder model to a set of automatically detected rib-surface points. The detection of the rib-surface points is done by a classifier using features representing local image intensity patterns and presence of rib shadows. Due to attenuation of the ultrasound signal, a clear shadow is visible behind the ribs. Evaluation of our segmentation method is done by computing the distance of manually annotated rib points to the surface of the automatically detected chest wall. We examined the performance on images obtained with the two most common 3D breast ultrasound devices in the market. In a dataset of 142 images, the average mean distance of the annotated points to the segmented chest wall was 5.59A,A+-3.08 mm.},

  abstract = {Automated 3D breast ultrasound (ABUS) has gained interest in breast imaging. Especially for screening women with dense breasts, ABUS appears to be beneficial. However, since the amount of data generated is large, the risk of oversight errors is substantial. Computer aided detection (CADe) may be used as a second reader to prevent oversight errors. When CADe is used in this fashion, it is essential that small cancers are detected, while the number of false positive findings should remain acceptable. In this work, the authors improve their previously developed CADe system in the initial candidate detection stage. The authors use a large number of 2D Haar-like features to differentiate lesion structures from false positives. Using a cascade of GentleBoost classifiers that combines these features, a likelihood score, highly specific for small cancers, can be efficiently computed. The likelihood scores are added to the previously developed voxel features to improve detection. The method was tested in a dataset of 414 ABUS volumes with 211 cancers. Cancers had a mean size of 14.72 mm. Free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate the performance of the algorithm with and without using the aforementioned Haar-like feature likelihood scores. After the initial detection stage, the number of missed cancer was reduced by 18.8% after adding Haar-like feature likelihood scores. The proposed technique significantly improves our previously developed CADe system in the initial candidate detection stage.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Automated 3D breast ultrasound (ABUS) has been proposed as a complementary screening
                             modality to mammography for early detection of breast cancers. To facilitate the interpretation
                             of ABUS images, automated diagnosis and detection techniques are being developed, in which
                             malignant lesion segmentation plays an important role. However, automated segmentation of cancer
                             in ABUS is challenging since lesion edges might not be well defined. In this study, the authors aim
                             at developing an automated segmentation method for malignant lesions in ABUS that is robust to
                             ill-defined cancer edges and posterior shadowing.

                             Methods: A segmentation method using depth-guided dynamic programming based on spiral scanning
                             is proposed. The method automatically adjusts aggressiveness of the segmentation according
                             to the position of the voxels relative to the lesion center. Segmentation is more aggressive in the
                             upper part of the lesion (close to the transducer) than at the bottom (far away from the transducer),
                             where posterior shadowing is usually visible. The authors used Dice similarity coefficient (Dice)
                             for evaluation. The proposed method is compared to existing state of the art approaches such as
                             graph cut, level set, and smart opening and an existing dynamic programming method without depth
                             dependence.

                             Results: In a dataset of 78 cancers, our proposed segmentation method achieved a mean Dice of
                             0.73+-0.14. The method outperforms an existing dynamic programming method (0.70+-0.16) on this
                             task (p = 0.03) and it is also significantly (p < 0.001) better than graph cut (0.66+-0.18), level set
                             based approach (0.63+-0.20) and smart opening (0.65+-0.12).

                             Conclusions: The proposed depth-guided dynamic programming method achieves accurate breast

  abstract = {{B}one specific, {CT}-based finite element ({FE}) analyses have great potential to accurately predict the fracture risk of deteriorated bones. {H}owever, it has been shown that differences exist between {FE}-models of femora scanned in a water basin or scanned in situ within the human body, as caused by differences in measured bone mineral densities ({BMD}). {I}n this study we hypothesized that these differences can be reduced by re-creating the patient {CT}-conditions by using an anatomically shaped physical model of the lower body. {BMD} distributions were obtained from four different femora that were scanned under three conditions: (1) in situ within the cadaver body, (2) in a water basin and (3) in the body model. {T}he {BMD} of the three scanning protocols were compared at two locations: proximally, in the trabecular bone of the femoral head, and in the cortical bone of the femoral shaft. {P}roximally, no significant differences in {BMD} were found between the in situ scans and the scans in the body model, whereas the densities from the water basin scans were on average 10.8\% lower than in situ. {I}n the femoral shaft the differences between the three scanning protocols were insignificant. {I}n conclusion, the body model better approached the in situ situation than a water basin. {F}uture studies can use this body model to mimic patient situations and to develop protocols to improve the performance of the {FE}-models in actual patients.},

  abstract = {Matching features on MLO and CC mammograms has shown to improve performance of computer aided detection systems. False positive rates can be lowered by reducing the search space during matching. Various methods have been proposed to de ne the search space. These do either not explicitly compensate for the breast deformation or simulate the whole process. In this study, we investigated the benefit of extending the common approaches by some basic compensations for breast deformations and compare several methods. Performance was tested on 50 pairs of mammograms with corresponding masses annotated by a radiologist. No clear advantage of straight strips or annular bands was observed for the common methods. Extensions to remove the pectoral muscle by shearing, compensating for gravity on MLO views by shearing and a volume-preserving transformation to get similar breast shapes in both views worked well when breast shapes were elliptical (mean (maximum) error of 5.3 (18.6) mm for 25 pairs). Using this strategy for elliptical breast shapes and straight strips after pectoral shearing for the rest resulted in lowest mean errors (6.7 mm) for the whole dataset.},

  abstract = {Manual counting of mitotic tumor cells in tissue sections constitutes one of the strongest prognostic markers for breast cancer. This procedure, however, is time-consuming and error-prone. We developed a method to automatically detect mitotic figures in breast cancer tissue sections based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Application of CNNs to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histological tissue sections is hampered by: (1) noisy and expensive reference standards established by pathologists, (2) lack of generalization due to staining variation across laboratories, and (3) high computational requirements needed to process gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). In this paper, we present a method to train and evaluate CNNs to specifically solve these issues in the context of mitosis detection in breast cancer WSIs. First, by combining image analysis of mitotic activity in phosphohistone-H3 (PHH3) restained slides and registration, we built a reference standard for mitosis detection in entire H&E WSIs requiring minimal manual annotation effort. Second, we designed a data augmentation strategy that creates diverse and realistic H&E stain variations by modifying the hematoxylin and eosin color channels directly. Using it during training combined with network ensembling resulted in a stain invariant mitosis detector. Third, we applied knowledge distillation to reduce the computational requirements of the mitosis detection ensemble with a negligible loss of performance. The system was trained in a single-center cohort and evaluated in an independent multicenter cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas on the three tasks of the Tumor Proliferation Assessment Challenge (TUPAC). We obtained a performance within the top-3 best methods for most of the tasks of the challenge.},

  abstract = {The number of mitotic figures per tumor area observed in hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) histological tissue sections under light microscopy is an important biomarker for breast cancer prognosis. Whole-slide imaging and computational pathology have enabled the development of automatic mitosis detection algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These models can suffer from high generalization error, i.e. trained networks often underperform on datasets originating from pathology laboratories different than the one that provided the training data, mainly due to the presence of inter-laboratory stain variations. We propose a novel data augmentation strategy that exploits the properties of the H and E color space to simulate a broad range of realistic H and E stain variations. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that data augmentation is performed directly in the H and E color space, instead of RGB. The proposed technique uses color deconvolution to transform RGB images into the H and E color space, modifies the H and E color channels stochastically, and projects them back to RGB space. We trained a CNN-based mitosis detector on homogeneous data from a single institution, and tested its performance on an external, multicenter cohort that contained a wide range of unseen H and E stain variations. We compared CNNs trained with and without the proposed augmentation strategy and observed a significant improvement in performance and robustness to unseen stain variations when the new color augmentation technique was included. In essence, we have shown that CNNs can be made robust to inter-lab stain variation by incorporating extensive stain augmentation techniques.},

Due to this color shift between laboratories, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with images from one lab often underperform on unseen images from the other lab. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce the generalization error, mainly grouped into two categories: stain color augmentation and stain color normalization. The former simulates a wide variety of realistic stain variations during training, producing stain-invariant CNNs. The latter aims to match training and test color distributions in order to reduce stain variation. For the first time, we compared some of these techniques and quantified their effect on CNN classification performance using a heterogeneous dataset of hematoxylin and eosin histopathology images from 4 organs and 9 pathology laboratories. Additionally, we propose a novel unsupervised method to perform stain color normalization using a neural network. Based on our experimental results, we provide practical guidelines on how to use stain color augmentation and stain color normalization in future computational pathology applications.},

  abstract = {We focus on the problem of training convolutional neural networks on gigapixel histopathology images to predict image-level targets. For this purpose, we extend Neural Image Compression (NIC), an image compression framework that reduces the dimensionality of these images using an encoder network trained unsupervisedly. We propose to train this encoder using supervised multitask learning (MTL) instead. We applied the proposed MTL NIC to two histopathology datasets and three tasks. First, we obtained state-of-the-art results in the Tumor Proliferation Assessment Challenge of 2016 (TUPAC16). Second, we successfully classified histopathological growth patterns in images with colorectal liver metastasis (CLM). Third, we predicted patient risk of death by learning directly from overall survival in the same CLM data. Our experimental results suggest that the representations learned by the MTL objective are: (1) highly specific, due to the supervised training signal, and (2) transferable, since the same features perform well across different tasks. Additionally, we trained multiple encoders with different training objectives, e.g. unsupervised and variants of MTL, and observed a positive correlation between the number of tasks in MTL and the system performance on the TUPAC16 dataset.},

First, scaling the generation of pixel-level annotated data (Chapter 2). Second, addressing intra- and inter-center stain variation (Chapters 2 and 3). Third, developing accurate and fast models to process entire whole-slide images (Chapters 2 and 4).

  abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate reproducibility and reliability of measurements of visually evoked retinal intrinsic optical signals {(IOS)} in humans by a commercially available spectral-domain {OCT}. Methods: We measured visually evoked {IOS} in 16 healthy volunteers with a {S}pectralis {OCT}, extended by a custom made optical stimulator. After 20 minutes of dark adaptation, a 3 mm2 area of the temporal perimacula was stimulated with a white flash of 0.1 seconds duration and 5.9 log scot. tld. luminance. A single-line {OCT} scan was recorded on-line before (baseline), during and after stimulation. From this {OCT} time-series we extracted {IOS} by calculating changes in reflectivity from baseline after application of the light stimulus. Custom software was used to compare reflectivity changes in the stimulated area to the non-stimulated area. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, we averaged the results of three single {IOS} recordings of each eye. Results: {IOS} of the stimulated area could repeatedly be recorded with reproducible results. Axial motion of the {OCT} scans during the measurements caused substantial noise which could significantly be reduced by averaging. Conclusions: We were able to reproducibly record visually evoked {IOS} with the {S}pectralis {OCT} coupled to an optical stimulator. Due to the high noise level, averaging of multiple measurements is necessary to clearly identify and analyze retinal signals. {IOS} imaging may be improved by three-dimensional eye tracking, since axial motion artifacts seem to be of significant influence.},

  abstract = {A growing body of evidence suggests that phototransduction can be studied in the human eye in vivo by imaging of fast intrinsic optical signals (IOS). There is consensus concerning the limiting influence of motion-associated imaging noise on the reproducibility of IOS-measurements, especially in those employing spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). However, no study to date has conducted a comprehensive analysis of this noise in the context of IOS-imaging. In this study, we discuss biophysical correlates of IOS, and we address motion-associated imaging noise by providing correctional post-processing methods. In order to avoid cross-talk of adjacent IOS of opposite signal polarity, cellular resolution and stability of imaging to the level of individual cones is likely needed. The optical Stiles-Crawford effect can be a source of significant IOS-imaging noise if alignment with the peak of the Stiles-Crawford function cannot be maintained. Therefore, complete head stabilization by implementation of a bite-bar may be critical to maintain a constant pupil entry position of the OCT beam. Due to depth-dependent sensitivity fall-off, heartbeat and breathing associated axial movements can cause tissue reflectivity to vary by 29\% over time, although known methods can be implemented to null these effects. Substantial variations in reflectivity can be caused by variable illumination due to changes in the beam pupil entry position and angle, which can be reduced by an adaptive algorithm based on slope-fitting of optical attenuation in the choriocapillary lamina.},

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography can image ocular blood cell flow and could thus provide novel insights in disease mechanisms of CSC. We evaluated depth-resolved flow in chronic CSC by OCT angiography compared to fluorescein angiography (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA).Eighteen eyes with chronic CSC, and six healthy controls, were included. Two human observers annotated areas of staining, hypofluorescence, and hotspots on FA and ICGA, and areas of abnormal flow on OCT angiography. Interobserver agreement in annotating OCT angiography and FA/ICGA was measured by Jaccard indices (JIs). We assessed colocation of flow abnormalities and subretinal fluid visible on OCT, and the distance between hotspots on ICGA from flow abnormalities.Abnormal areas were most frequently annotated in late-phase ICGA and choriocapillary OCT angiography, with moderately high (median JI, 0.74) and moderate (median JI, 0.52) interobserver agreement, respectively. Abnormalities on late-phase ICGA and FA colocated with those on OCT angiography. Aberrant choriocapillary OCT angiography presented as foci of reduced flow surrounded by hyperperfused areas. Hotspots on ICGA were located near hypoperfused spots on OCT angiography (mean distance, 168 AZA 1/4 m). Areas with current or former subretinal fluid were colocated with flow abnormalities.On OCT angiography, chronic CSC showed irregular choriocapillary flow patterns, corresponding to ICGA abnormalities. These results suggest focal choriocapillary ischemia with surrounding hyperperfusion that may lead to subretinal fluid leakage.},

  abstract = {This dissertation consists out of two parts. One part concerns some results on Gaussian harmonic analysis and the other on an optimization problem in optics. In the first part we study the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with respect to the Gaussian measure. We focus on two areas. One is on "Gaussian? analogues of classical results in harmonic analysis, and in the second area we study the higher time-derivatives of the integral kernels associated to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator. After introducing the necessary preliminaries on Hermite polynomials, we look at the non-tangential maximal function for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup and we prove analogues to classical results. An important distinction here with the classical case is that the maximal function result for the Laplacian allows for t > 0, whereas our result only holds for certain 0 < t < 1 where the exact range depends on the position in space. Next, we compute an explicit formula for the higher time-derivatives of the integral kernel related to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator. As an application we show several kernel bounds using our formula. Finally, as far as the mathematical part is concerned, we study off-diagonal estimates related to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator. It is well-known that these hold for the Laplacian with respect to the Lebesgue measure, but do these hold for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator with respect to the Gaussian measure? It is known that we always would have L2-L2 bounds, even for all t > 0, but in applications one often wants L2-L1 bounds. Even though these do hold for the Laplacian, we show that these cannot hold for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator even for small 0 < t < 1. Moreover, our proof shows that letting the maximal t depend on the position in space will not work either. In the final part of this dissertation we study a problem in theoretical optics. Here we study the optimization of the electric field induced by light as a plane wave in a disk with given radius. We study the electric fields in the lens pupil and the focal region for several radii in the orde of magnitude of the wave length of the light used.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE
                             In this study we evaluated the potential of a computer system to select exams with low likelihood of
                             containing cancer.

                             METHOD AND MATERIALS
                             We collected a representative set of 1649 referrals with different screening outcome from the Dutch
                             breast cancer screening. The dataset comprised 489 true positives (TP) exams and 1160 false
                             positive (FP) exams. In addition, we collected 1000 true negative (TN) exams from the same
                             screening population. All exams were automatically analyzed with Transpara v1.2.0 (ScreenPoint
                             Medical, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Transpara uses deep learning algorithms to, based on
                             soft-tissue lesions and calcifications findings, categorize every mammogram on a 10-point scale. This
                             computerized score represents the likelihood that a cancer is present in the exam at hand, where 10
                             represents the highest likelihood that a cancer is present. It is defined in such a way that, in a
                             screening setting, the number of mammograms in each category is roughly equal.

                             In this study, we determined the distribution of the computerized cancer likelihood scores for the TP,
                             FP and TN exams. In particular we quantified for each category the fraction of cases with a cancer
                             likelihood score below or equal to 5, including about 50% of the mammograms. Additionally we
                             evaluated the positive predictive value (PPV) of referrals in each likelihood category.

                             RESULTS
                             5.11% of the TPs, 20.3% of the FPs and 45.0% of the TNs were assigned to the likelihood categories
                             1 to 5. This corresponds to 0.7 cancers per 1000 in the group with score 1-5 and 11.2 per 1000 with a
                             score higher than 5, based on the cancer detection rate of 6.5/1000 in the Dutch screening program.
                             The PPV was 8.00%, 8.14%, and 44.9% for cancer likelihood scores 1, 5 and 10, respectively.

                             CONCLUSION
                             Automated identification of a fraction of screening mammograms that most likely are normal is
                             feasible.},

  abstract = {A general method is presented for determining the maximum electric energy in a bounded region of optical fields with given time-averaged flux of electromagnetic energy. Time-harmonic fields are considered whose plane wave expansion consists of propagating plane waves only, i.e., evanescent waves are excluded. The bounded region can be quite general: it can consist of finitely many points, or be a curve, a curved surface or a bounded volume. The optimum optical field is eigenfield corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of a compact linear integral operator which depends on the bounded region. It is explained how these optimum fields can be realized by focusing appropriate pupil fields. The special case that the region is a circular disc perpendicular to the direction of optical axis is investigated by numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {Technological developments in ophthalmic imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) create new possibilities for diagnostics in eye care. AI has already been applied in ophthalmic diabetes care. AI-systems currently detect diabetic retinopathy in general practice with a high sensitivity and specificity. AI-systems for the screening, monitoring and treatment of age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma are promising and are still being developed. AI-algorithms, however, only perform tasks for which they have been specifically trained and highly depend on the data and reference-standard that were used to train the system in identifying a certain abnormality or disease. How the data and the gold standard were established and determined, influences the performance of the algorithm. Furthermore, interpretability of deep learning algorithms is still an ongoing issue. By highlighting on images the areas that were critical for the decision of the algorithm, users can gain more insight into how algorithms come to a particular result.},

Section 1.1 to 1.5 give general information about breast cancer, about screening programmes to detect breast cancer, and about modalities that are used to image the breast. In Section 1.6 we describe the use of computer aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) systems and review some important studies that evaluate potential benets of using CAD. At the moment multi view CAD systems are being developed that include information from multiple views. Section 1.7 summarises recent advances in this eld. In this thesis we focus on the design of a multi view CAD system that incorporates information about temporal changes that take place between two consecutive screening rounds. Section 1.8 shortly discusses the objective for this approach. Section 1.9 claries denitions and nomenclature used in this thesis. Finally, in Section 1.10, we present an overview of this thesis.},

Six radiologists rated 198 cases, 99 benign and 99 malignant. For each case, the mammograms from two consecutive screening rounds were available. The mass was visible on the prior view in 40\% of the cases. Independently, a CAD programe also rated each mass lesion making use of information from prior and current views. The following reading situations were compared: single reading, independent reading with CAD, and independent double reading. Independent reading with CAD was implemented by averaging the scaled ratings from each radiologist and the scaled CAD scores. We implemented independent double reading by averaging the scaled scores from two radiologists. Results were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) methodology and multiple reader multiple case analysis. The average performance, measured as the area under the ROC curve (A(z) value), was 0.80 for the single-reading mode. For independent double reading, the average performance improved to 0.81. This improvement was not significant. For independent interpretation with CAD, the average performance significantly increased to 0.83 (P < 0.05). We conclude that CAD technology with temporal analysis has the potential to help radiologists with the task of discriminating between benign and malignant masses.},

  title = {AI-assisted analysis of CT perfusion to predict response in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma},
  abstract = {CT perfusion (CTP) shows potential for treatment response in patients pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, current pharmacokinetic models are difficult to use in clinical decision-making as they do not always accurately reflect changes in perfusion. Visual changes in the time-intensity curve (TIC) are not translated in perfusion parameters. We developed a kinetic model-independent method to analyze time-intensity curves, based on experiences in dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI in prostate cancer. Methods or Background: Initial data (n=12) from a prospective study evaluating chemotherapy response in patients with PDAC. CTP was performed at baseline and after 3 months. A bolus-timing optimized scan protocol with 23 perfusion images was used. The tumor section with the largest diameter was free-hand annotated at baseline and matching follow-up section to create TICs. Our method used a trilinear fit, separating the static phase, enhancement phase, and wash-out phase. Linear discriminate analysis (LDA) was trained to predict response based on the curve changes after treatment. One-sided T-test was used to test the statistical differences between groups. Results or Findings: Using this method we could discriminate responders (n=4) from non-responders (n=8), classified with RECIST. Our curve fit showed that after treatment maximum enhancement increased by 42% in responders and 7% in non-responders (p=0.02). Enhancement slope increased with 140% in responders and 3% in non-responders (p=0.06). Changes in static enhancement and TTP did not significantly differ. Linear discriminant analysis with all four features classified treatment response with 92% accuracy. Conclusion: We developed an AI-assisted tool with a robust, kinetic model-independent method for TIC analysis in CTP resulting in perfusion features that distinguish between responders and non-responders in PDAC after chemotherapy. Limitations:Early results of a feasibility study, future work will include more patients and comparison with pharmacokinetic models.},

The models of image formation underlying the Standard Attenuation Rate (SAR) are used to facilitate the forward simulation of the appearance of a lesion in a breast. By forming hypotheses, informed from measurements on the acquired image, virtual 3D scenes are constructed which predict the size, position and radiodensity of a suspect lesion and the surrounding breast tissue. Comparisons between simulations of this scene, and the acquired image enable both the refinement of the hypothesis, and the assessment of the likelihood of the hypothesis being correct. In the event of a high likelihood of correctness, the hypothesised lesion informs diagnosis. The application of the method to a patient image containing a cyst shows it has an attenuation corresponding to water (SAR 1.246), and an invasive carcinoma which is considerably denser at SAR 2.27. Thus the technique yields a quantitative radiodensity measure for discrimination in diagnostic decision making.},

Now 2 years later, the authors of this review consider whether, in their opinion, there is any evidence that supports that thesis. Specifically, we consider the opportunities and challenges for applying ML (the study of computer algorithms that are able to learn from example data and extrapolate the learned information to unseen data) algorithms in toxicologic pathology and how regulatory bodies are navigating this rapidly evolving field. Although we see similarities with the "Last Mile" metaphor, the weight of evidence suggests that toxicologic pathologists should approach ML with an equal dose of skepticism and enthusiasm. There are increasing opportunities for impact in our field that leave the authors cautiously excited and optimistic. Toxicologic pathologists have the opportunity to critically evaluate ML applications with a "call-to-arms" mentality. Why should we be late adopters? There is ample evidence to encourage engagement, growth, and leadership in this field.},

Three series were obtained with increasing thicknesses of a simulated soft-tissue layer (5, 10, and 20 cm) and increasing tube voltage (50, 70, and 90 kVp). A fourth series was obtained with exposure conditions adapted to the phantom instructions (75 kVp). Images were acquired with a flat-panel detector (cesium iodide scintillator) and storage-phosphor plates at five exposure levels (speed class range, 100-1,600). Five readers evaluated 84 images to determine the threshold contrast of 12 lesion diameters (range, 0.25-11.1 mm). Statistical significance of differences between the two digital systems was assessed with two-way analysis of variance.A linear relationship was found between the number of detected lesions and the logarithm of exposure (R(2) > 0.98 for all series). On average, the flat-panel system required 45\% less exposure than did the phosphor plates when 20-cm-thick acrylic was superimposed on the test object. Differences in exposure requirements were smaller with decreasing thicknesses of simulated soft-tissue layers and lower tube voltages (39\% at 10 cm and 70 kVp, and 17\% at 5 cm and 50 kVp). All differences were statistically significant.Flat-panel radiography provides improved contrast detectability and a potential for exposure reduction compared with those with storage-phosphor radiography. The best performance was achieved with conditions comparable to those for radiography of the trunk and lowest for conditions that simulate radiography of the extremities.},

Primary and secondary thoracic lymphoma represent a diagnostic challenge in radiology: the patterns are variable in radiography as well as in computed tomography and alter under therapy. Radiological studies, especially CT, are an integral part of the staging process. MRI is considered advantageous for chest wall disease.

Lesion detection with soft-copy reading was assessed using a high-contrast grayscale 2K CRT monitor under the following conditions: (1) subdued lighting (<50 lux); (2) normal lighting conditions (450 lux) without, and (3) with a sensitivity modulation to automatically adjust the CRT luminance to the increased amount of ambient light. Reading data were analyzed according to receiver operating curve. Significance of differences was tested using an analysis of variance for repeated measures.Ambient room light of 450 lux did not significantly influence the detection of nodules and patchy opacities. However, bright ambient light significantly decreased detection of micronodules (0.60 vs. 0.74) and lines (0.52 vs. 0.66) relative to subdued lighting conditions. Automatic luminance adjustment could compensate the effect of ambient light for the micronodules (0.77) but not for the lines (0.53).Bright ambient light significantly decreases detection of small low-contrast structures. This may be partially but not completely compensated by an automatic luminance adaptation.},

DR (Az = 0.87 and 0.67) performed slightly better than CRD, being significant only for the detection of micronodules. Acquisition dose significantly affected only the detection of lines and micronodules, whereas the detection of nodules and patchy opacities was not significantly different with reduced exposure, regardless of the system used.The dual-readout CR system significantly outperformed the single-readout CR and almost equaled the performance of DR. Dose reduction was more critical for small-sized lesions (micronodules, lines) than for nodular or patchy opacifications and affected mainly the lesions in high attenuation areas.},

  abstract = {To compare the visibility of anatomic structures in direct-detector chest radiographs acquired with different tube voltages at equal effective doses to the patient.The study protocol was approved by the institutional internal review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Posteroanterior chest radiographs of 48 consecutively selected patients were obtained at 90, 121, and 150 kVp by using a flat-panel-detector unit that was based on cesium iodide technology and automated exposure control. Monte Carlo simulations were used to verify that the effective dose for all kilovoltage settings was equal. Five radiologists subjectively and independently rated the delineation of anatomic structures on hard-copy images by using a five-point scale. They also ranked image quality in a blinded side-by-side comparison. Average ranking scores were compared by using one-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. Data were analyzed for the entire patient group and for two patient subgroups that were formed according to body mass index (BMI).The visibility scores of most anatomic structures were significantly superior with the 90-kVp images (mean score, 3.11), followed by the 121-kVp (mean score, 2.95) and 150-kVp images (mean score, 2.80). Differences did not reach significance (P > .05) only for the delineation of the peripheral vessels, the heart contours, and the carina. This was also true for the subgroup of patients (n = 24) with a BMI greater than and the subgroup of patients (n = 24) with a BMI less than the mean BMI (26.9 kg/m(2)). At side-by-side comparison, the readers rated 90-kVp images as having superior image quality in the majority of image triplets; the percentage of 90-kVp images rated as "first choice" ranged from 60\% (29 of 48 patients) to 90\% (43 of 48 patients), with a median of 88\% (42 of 48 patients), among the readers.Delineation of most anatomic structures and overall image quality were ranked superior in digital radiographs acquired with lower kilovoltage at a constant effective patient dose.},

  title = {Analysis and endotracheal tube detection in chest x-rays using deep learning},
  abstract = {The following work is focusing on the development of two deep learning models applied to chest x-rays. The first model, Imagesorter, provides a solution for sorting chest x-ray images where metadata is not available or is unreliable. This is frequently the case when accessing large collection of radiographs and can result in very time consuming procedures to obtain reliable data. Specifically, the algorithm returns four properties of the image: the type of image presented, rotation (wheather the image is rotated), inversion (whether the grayscale level of the radiograph inverted) and orientation (whether a lateral chest x-ray is mirrored). Nearly 30,000 radiographs were gathered and used to train, validate and test a deep convolutional neural network. For the purpose, a ResNet50 network pretrained on ImageNet and finetuned on the chest x-ray dataset was used. Moreover, the network architechture was modified to return all the four features at once. The model achieved very good results over the test set and can be consider a valid tool to efficiently explore and sort large x-ray collections. The second model, Endotracheal-Tube, detect the presence of an endotracheal tube in a chest x-ray. Many automated methods require to gather chest x-rays where an endotracheal tube is present. The presented algorithm can help gather reliable data from large collection in a short amount of time. A large dataset was created for the project and a preprocessing method to crop a square area of the image where the tube lays is presented. Four models are trained, validated and tested over the same dataset to assess the best. At the end an InceptionV3 network pretrained on ImageNet and finetuned on the dataset achieved the best results (AUC = 0.993).
    Both projects are part of OpenCXR, an open source library developed by the Chest X-Ray teams at the Dignostic Image Analysis Group at the Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.},

  title = {Familial discordance in disease phenotype in siblings with Stargardt disease},
  abstract = {Purpose:
                             To investigate intersibling discordance of the Stargardt disease (STGD1) phenotype.

                             Methods:
                             We performed a retrospective cohort study among siblings with genetically confirmed STGD1 and at least one available fundus autofluorescence (FAF) image of both eyes. We compared age of onset within families using the youngest patient as the reference and a predetermined threshold value of 10 years for significant differences. Disease duration was matched to investigate differences in best-corrected visual acuity, and we determined and compared the survival time for reaching severe visual impairment (SVI); (<20/200 Snellen or > 1.3 Logarithm of the Minimal Angle of Resolution (LogMAR)). Central retinal atrophy surface area was quantified and compared by two independent graders using the semi-automated EyeNED software. Additionally, both graders performed qualitative assessment of FAF patterns to identify phenotypic differences and commonalities. Main outcome measures included differences in age of onset, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), time to develop legal blindness, FAF atrophy surface area and autofluorescence patterns.

                             Results:
                             Significant differences in age of onset were present in 5/17 families, ranging from 13 to 39 years. BCVA was matched in 12/17 families and the median difference was 0.41 (0 - 1.10) LogMAR for the right and 0.41 (0 - 1.08) LogMAR for the left eye, and we found extreme differences in five families ranging from 0.58 to 1.1 LogMAR. The median age at which patients developed SVI was 14 years. We observed significant differences in time to develop SVI in three out of 12 families with matched survival times, ranging from 14 to 29 years. Median central retinal atrophy surface area was 11.38 mm2 in the right (range 1.98 - 44.78 mm2) and 10.59 mm2 in the left (range 1.61 - 40.59 mm2) eyes and was highly comparable between siblings, with the exception of family one. Qualitative FAF phenotypes were comparable in all sibling pairs.

                             Conclusions:
                             Phenotypic discordance between siblings with STGD1 disease carrying the same ABCA4 variants is a prevalent phenomenon. Functional outcomes can differ substantially despite highly comparable FAF phenotypes, which complicates sibling-based prognosis. While environmental factor are likely to modify the disease course, the relatively young median age at which patients develop SVI indicates an important role for genetic factors as disease modifiers.},

                             Siblings with genetically confirmed STGD1 and at least 1 available fundus autofluorescence (FAF) image of both eyes.

                             Methods
                             We compared age at onset within families. Disease duration was matched to investigate differences in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and compared the survival time for reaching severe visual impairment (<20/200 Snellen or >1.0 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR]). Central retinal atrophy area was quantified independently by 2 experienced graders using semiautomated software and compared between siblings.

                             Main Outcome Measures
                             Differences in age at onset, disease duration-matched BCVA, time to severe visual impairment development, FAF atrophy area, FAF patterns, and genotypes.

                             Results
                             Substantial differences in age at onset were present in 5 of 17 families, ranging from 13 to 39 years. Median BCVA at baseline was 0.60 logMAR (range, -0.20 to 2.30 logMAR; Snellen equivalent, 20/80 [range, 20/12-hand movements]) in the right eye and 0.50 logMAR (range, -0.20 to 2.30 logMAR; Snellen equivalent, 20/63 [range, 20/12-hand movements]) in the left eye. Disease duration-matched BCVA was investigated in 12 of 17 families, and the median difference was 0.41 logMAR (range, 0.00-1.10 logMAR) for the right eye and 0.41 logMAR (range, 0.00-1.08 logMAR) for the left eye. We observed notable differences in time to severe visual impairment development in 7 families, ranging from 1 to 29 years. Median central retinal atrophy area was 11.38 mm2 in the right eye (range, 1.98-44.78 mm2) and 10.59 mm2 in the left eye (range, 1.61-40.59 mm2) and highly comparable between siblings. Similarly, qualitative FAF and SD OCT phenotypes were highly comparable between siblings.

                             Conclusions
                             Phenotypic discordance between siblings with STGD1 carrying the same ABCA4 variants is a prevalent phenomenon. Although the FAF phenotypes are highly comparable between siblings, functional outcomes differ substantially. This complicates both sibling-based prognosis and genotype-phenotype correlations and has important implications for patient care and management.},

The data set consisted of 777 images corresponding to 382patients. To extract lesions from the mammograms a segmentationalgorithm based on dynamic programming was used. Features wereextracted for each lesion. A k-nearest neighbor algorithm was used incombination with a leave-one-out procedure to select the best featuresfor classification purposes. Classification accuracy was evaluatedusing the area Az under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The average test Az value for the task of classifying masses on a single mammographic view was 0.79. In a case-based evaluation we obtained an Az value of 0.84.},

  abstract = {In this study it is shown that the performance of a statistical method for detection of microcalcification clusters in digital mammograms, can be improved substantially by using a second step of classification. During this second step, detected clusters are automatically classified into true positive and false positive detected clusters. For classification the k-nearest neighbor method was used in a leave-one-patient-out procedure. The sensitivity level of the method was adjusted both in the first detection step as in the second classification step. The Mahalanobis distance was used as criterion in the sequential forward selection procedure for selection of features. This primary feature selection method was combined with a classification performance criterion for the final feature selection. By applying the initial detection at various levels of sensitivity, various sets of false and true positive detected clusters were created. At each of these sets the classification ca be performed. Results show that the overall best FROC performance after secondary classification is obtained by varying sensitivity levels in both the first and second step. Furthermore, it was shown that performing a new feature selection for each different set of false and true positives is essential. A large database of 245 digitized mammograms with 341 clusters was used for evaluation of the method.},

  abstract = {To investigate whether adrenal volumetry provides better agreement with adrenal vein sampling (AVS) than conventional CT for subtyping PA. Furthermore, we evaluated whether the size of this contralateral adrenal was a prognostic factor for clinical outcome after unilateral adrenalectomy. We retrospectively analyzed volumes of both adrenal glands of the 180 CT-scans (88/180 with unilateral and 92/180 with bilateral disease) of the patients with PA included in the SPARTACUS trial of which 85 also had undergone an AVS. In addition, we examined CT-scans of 20 healthy individuals to compare adrenal volumes with published normal values. Adrenal volume was higher for the left than the right adrenal (mean and SD: 6.49 +- 2.77 ml versus 5.25 +- 1.87 ml for the right adrenal; p < 0.001). Concordance between volumetry and AVS in subtyping was 58.8%, versus 51.8% between conventional CT results and AVS (p = NS). The volumes of the contralateral adrenals in the patients with unilateral disease (right 4.78 +- 1.37 ml; left 6.00 +- 2.73 ml) were higher than those of healthy controls reported in the literature (right 3.62 +- 1.23 ml p < 0.001; left 4.84 +- 1.67 ml p = 0.02). In a multivariable analysis the contralateral volume was not associated with biochemical or clinical success, nor with the defined daily doses of antihypertensive agents at 1 year follow-up. Volumetry of the adrenal glands is not superior to current assessment of adrenal size by CT for subtyping patients with PA. Furthermore, in patients with unilateral disease the size of the contralateral adrenal is enlarged but its size is not associated with outcome.},

  abstract = {The automated differentiation between benign and malignant abnormalities is a difficult problem in the breast cancer domain. While previous studies consider a single Bayesian network approach, in this paper we propose a novel perspective based on Bayesian network decomposition. We consider three methods that allow for different (levels of) network topological or structural decomposition. Through examples, we demonstrate some advantages of Bayesian network decomposition for the problem at hand: (i) natural and more intuitive representation of breast abnormalities and their features (ii) compact representation and efficient manipulation of large conditional probability tables, and (iii) a possible improvement in the knowledge acquisition and representation processes.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women world-wide. One in nine women will be diagnosed with a form of breast cancer in her lifetime. In an effort to diagnose cancer at an early stage, screening programs have been introduced by using periodic mammographic examinations in asymptomatic women. In evaluating screening cases, radiologists are usually presented with two mammographic images of each breast as a cancerous lesion tends to be observed in different breast projections (views). Most computer-aided detection (CAD) systems, on the other hand, only analyse single views independently, and thus fail to account for the interaction between the views and the breast cancer detection can be obscured due to the lack of consistency in lesion marking. This limits the usability and the trust in the performance of such systems. In this chapter, we propose a unified Bayesian network framework for exploiting multi-view dependencies between the suspicious regions detected by a single-view CAD system. The framework is based on a multi-stage scheme, which models the way radiologists interpret mammograms, at four different levels: region, view, breast and case. At each level, we combine all available image information for the patient obtained from a single-view CAD system using a special class of Bayesian networks?causal independence models. The results from experiments with actual screening data of 1063 cases, from which 383 were cancerous, show that our approach outperforms the single-view CAD system in distinguishing between normal and abnormal cases. This is a promising step towards the development of automated systems that can provide a valuable ?second opinion? to the screening radiologists for improved evaluation of breast cancer cases.},

One of the main problems is the large number of false positives prompted, which is a critical issue in screening programs where the number of normal cases is considerably large. A crucial determinant for this problem is the dependence of the CAD output on the single pixel-based locations initially detected. To refine the initial detection step, in this paper, we propose a novel approach by considering the context information between the neighbouring pixel features and classes for every initially detected suspicious location. Our modelling scheme is based on the Conditional Random Field technique and the mammographic features extracted by image processing techniques. In experimental study, we demonstrated the practical application of the approach and we compared its performance to that of a previously developed CAD system. The results demonstrated the superiority of the context modelling in terms of significantly improved accuracy without increase in computation efforts.},

The strength of this method is its ability to systematically and naturally capture uncertain domain knowledge, while performing information fusion in a computationally efficient way. We examine the value of the method for mammographic analysis and demonstrate its advantages in terms of explicit knowledge representation and accuracy (increase of at least 6.3\% and 5.2\% of true positive detection rates at 5\% and 10\% false positive rates) in comparison with previous single-view and multi-view systems, and benchmark fusion methods such as naA-A?A 1/2 ve Bayes and logistic regression.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To obtain a balanced view on the role and place of expert knowledge and learning methods in building Bayesian networks for medical image interpretation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The interpretation of mammograms was selected as the example medical image interpretation problem. Medical image interpretation has its own common standards and procedures. The impact of these on two complementary methods for Bayesian network construction was explored. Firstly, methods for the discretisation of continuous features were investigated, yielding multinomial distributions that were compared to the original Gaussian probabilistic parameters of the network. Secondly, the structure of a manually constructed Bayesian network was tested by structure learning from image data. The image data used for the research came from screening mammographic examinations of 795 patients, of whom 344 were cancerous. RESULTS: The experimental results show that there is an interesting interplay of machine learning results and background knowledge in medical image interpretation. Networks with discretised data lead to better classification performance (increase in the detected cancers of up to 11.7\%), easier interpretation, and a better fit to the data in comparison to the expert-based Bayesian network with Gaussian probabilistic parameters. Gaussian probability distributions are often used in medical image interpretation because of the continuous nature of many of the image features. The structures learnt supported many of the expert-originated relationships but also revealed some novel relationships between the mammographic features. Using discretised features and performing structure learning on the mammographic data has further improved the cancer detection performance of up to 17\% compared to the manually constructed Bayesian network model. CONCLUSION: Finding the right balance between expert knowledge and data-derived knowledge, both at the level of network structure and parameters, is key to using Bayesian networks for medical image interpretation. A balanced approach to building Bayesian networks for image interpretation yields more accurate and understandable Bayesian network models.},

  abstract = {Background: Although several deep learning (DL) calcium scoring methods have achieved excellent performance for specific CT protocols, their performance in a range of CT examination types is unknown. Purpose: To evaluate the performance of a DL method for automatic calcium scoring across a wide range of CT examination types and to investigate whether the method can adapt to different types of CT examinations when representative images are added to the existing training data set. Materials and Methods: The study included 7240 participants who underwent various types of nonenhanced CT examinations that included the heart: coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring CT, diagnostic CT of the chest, PET attenuation correction CT, radiation therapy treatment planning CT, CAC screening CT, and low-dose CT of the chest. CAC and thoracic aorta calcification (TAC) were quantified using a convolutional neural network trained with (a) 1181 low-dose chest CT examinations (baseline), (b) a small set of examinations of the respective type supplemented to the baseline (data specific), and (c) a combination of examinations of all available types (combined). Supplemental training sets contained 199-568 CT images depending on the calcium burden of each population. The DL algorithm performance was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between DL and manual (Agatston) CAC and (volume) TAC scoring and with linearly weighted k values for cardiovascular risk categories (Agatston score; cardiovascular disease risk categories: 0, 1-10, 11-100, 101-400, >400). Results: At baseline, the DL algorithm yielded ICCs of 0.79-0.97 for CAC and 0.66-0.98 for TAC across the range of different types of CT examinations. ICCs improved to 0.84-0.99 (CAC) and 0.92-0.99 (TAC) for CT protocol-specific training and to 0.85-0.99 (CAC) and 0.96-0.99 (TAC) for combined training. For assignment of cardiovascular disease risk category, the k value for all test CT scans was 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89, 0.91) for the baseline training. It increased to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.93) for both data-specific and combined training. Conclusion: A deep learning calcium scoring algorithm for quantification of coronary and thoracic calcium was robust, despite substantial differences in CT protocol and variations in subject population. Augmenting the algorithm training with CT protocol-specific images further improved algorithm performance.},

  title = {The alpha-motoneuron pool as transmitter of rhythmicities in cortical motor drive},
  booktitle = {International Society of Electrophysiology and Kinesiology},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {AIM: Corticospinal interaction gives support to the conceptual mechanism called communication through coherence, which is the assumption that neuronal groups communicate through coherent oscillatory activity. In this respect it is interesting how centrally evoked oscillatory phenomena are translated into EMG activity. We investigated the transfer properties of central drive transmission via the alpha-motoneuron pool to the muscle. METHODS: A model based on that of P. Matthews (J Physiol. 1996;492:597-628) was constructed (Figure 1). This model was used for the simulation of alpha-motoneuron firing patterns and the EMG signal as response to central drive input. Short-term synchrony was introduced by assuming a common input to each pair of alpha-motoneurons. The cortical input was modulated to investigate the transfer through the alpha-motoneuron pool in the frequency domain. Coherence between stochastical central input and EMG signal is also evaluated. Furthermore, the effect due to the often-used EMG rectification is investigated. RESULTS: Modulated cortical input is transferred with only a limited level of non-linearity. The alpha-motoneuron firing frequencies do play a role in the frequency distribution of the amplitude spectrum. However, no preference over proportionality in the region of the firing frequencies was found. Coherence analysis between the summed central input to the alpha-motoneuron pool and the EMG signal is large whereby the coupling strength does not depend on frequency in a range from 1 to 100 Hz. Common central input to pairs of alpha-motoneurons strongly increases the coherence levels as well as the amplitudes in the frequency spectrum. Rectification of the EMG signal introduces a clear frequency dependence. Especially the motoneuron firing frequency range is emphasized. CONCLUSION: Centrally evoked oscillatory phenomena are strongly transmitted via the alpha-motoneuron pool. The motoneuron firing frequencies do play a role in the transmission gain, but do not influence the coherence levels. Rectification of the EMG signal enhances the transmission gain, but lowers the coherence and introduces a strong frequency dependency. Because of its non-linearity, we think that rectification should better be avoided.},

Er is onderzocht of in het brede spectraalgebied meetbare verschillen tussen prostaat en NVB zijn, die gebruikt kunnen worden om de weefseltypes voor de chirurg duidelijker zichtbaar te maken. Omdat van de interne organen weinig optische spectra buiten het zichtbare gebied bekend zijn, is een meetopstelling op maat ontwikkeld. Materiaal en methoden Tijdens 19 robotgeassisteerde laparascopische prostatectomieAfA<<n zijn met een speciaal ontwikkelde steriele fiberprobe in-vivo reflectiespectra van prostaat en NVB genomen van 350 tot 1830 nm. Deze spectra werden genormaliseerd om inter- en intra-variabiliteit te reduceren. De genormaliseerde spectra werden vervolgens door een computer geclassificeerd. Resultaten Figuur 1 toont de genormaliseerde spectra op geselecteerde golflengtes voor NVB en prostaatweefsel. In de figuur is te zien dat de spectraal metingen van de weefsels verschillend genoeg zijn om automatisch te kunnen onderscheiden. In de experimenten is 94% van de aangeboden weefsels correct geclassificeerd. 75% van de hiervoor nuttige spectrale verschillen liggen buiten het zichtbare gebied. Conclusie De fiberprobe blijkt laparoscopisch goed hanteerbaar waardoor reflectiespectra reproduceerbaar meetbaar zijn op (in principe) alle interne weefseltypes. De spectrale verschillen tussen prostaatweefsel en NVB kunnen dan versterkt weergegeven worden door een endoscopische beeldketen wanneer deze voorzien wordt van een beeldbewerkingseenheid die krachtig genoeg is deze multispectrale beelden te verwerken. Hiervoor dient de nu verzamelde kennis vertaald tot een hardware-platform.},

  abstract = {MR to TRUS guided biopsies can be a cost-effective solution for prostate biopsies. Prostate cancer can be detected on MRI and a biopsy can be directed towards a suspicious region. With the help of an accurate MR-US registration method the tumor can also be targeted under transrectal US guidance. For heterogeneous tumors, the needle should be guided towards the most aggressive part of the tumor. Not the tumor size, but the size of this smaller tumor hotspot determines the required accuracy of the registration. We investigate the percentage of tumors that are heterogeneous and the corresponding hotspot volume. Results show a hotspot in 63% of the tumors, with a median volume of 0.3 cm3. By assuming a spherical shape, the required accuracy can be determined. For a 90% tumor hit-rate, the registration error should be less than 2.87 mm.},

  abstract = {Adding MR-derived information to standard transrectal ultrasound (US) images for guiding prostate biopsy is of substantial clinical interest. A tumor visible on MR images can be projected on US by using MR-US registration. A common approach is to use surface-based registration. We hypothesize that using biomechanical modeling will better control deformation inside the prostate than a regular surface-based registration method. We developed a novel method using a surface-based registration and extended it with finite element (FE) simulation to predict internal deformation of the prostate. For each patient, a tetrahedral mesh was constructed from the manual prostate segmentation. Next, the internal prostate deformation was simulated using the derived radial surface displacement as boundary condition. The deformation field within the gland was calculated using the predicted FE node displacements and thin-plate spline interpolation. We tested our method on MR guided MR biopsy imaging data as landmarks can easily be identified on MR images. For evaluation of the registration accuracy we used 45 landmarks located in all regions of the prostate. Our results show that the median target registration error of a surface-based registration with biomechanical regularization is 1.88 mm, which is significantly different from 2.61 mm without biomechanical regularization. We can conclude that biomechanical FE modeling has the potential to improve the accuracy of multimodal prostate registrationwhen comparing it to regular surface-based registration.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To estimate the required spatial alignment accuracy for correctly grading 95 \% of peripheral zone (PZ) prostate cancers using a system for multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR)-guided ultrasound (US) biopsies. METHODS: PZ prostate tumours were retrospectively annotated on multiparametric MR series using prostatectomy specimens as reference standard. Tumours were grouped based on homogeneous and heterogeneous apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values using an automated ADC texture analysis method. The proportion of heterogeneous tumours containing a distinct, high Gleason grade tumour focus yielding low ADC values was determined. Both overall tumour and high-grade focal volumes were calculated. All high-grade target volumes were then used in a simulated US biopsy system with adjustable accuracy to determine the hit rate. RESULTS: An ADC-determined high-grade tumour focus was found in 63 \% of the PZ prostate tumours. The focal volumes were significantly smaller than the total tumour volumes (median volume of 0.3 ml and 1.1 ml respectively). To correctly grade 95 \% of the aggressive tumour components the target registration error (TRE) should be smaller than 1.9 mm. CONCLUSIONS: To enable finding the high Gleason grade component in 95 \% of PZ prostate tumours with MR-guided US biopsies, a technical registration accuracy of 1.9 mm is required. KEY POINTS : AC/a,!AC/ MRI can identify foci of prostatic cancer with reduced apparent diffusion coefficients AC/a,!AC/ Sixty-three per cent of prostatic peripheral zone tumours contain high-grade tumour low ADC foci AC/a,!AC/ The median volume of such foci is 0.3 ml AC/a,!AC/ Biopsy targets are significantly smaller than whole tumour volumes AC/a,!AC/ Simulated registration accuracy is 1.9 mm for correctly grading 95 \% of tumours.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {PURPOSE To investigate the effect of extending a non-rigid surface-based registration method with biomechanical modeling for prostate MR guided biopsies on the target registration error (TRE) using internal reference landmarks. The method is fully automated and we compare accuracy to previous results obtained with manual optimization of parameters in every patient. METHOD AND MATERIALS The accuracy of a novel non-rigid registration method involving biomechanical modeling to account for deformations inside the prostate was determined. While MR-TRUS registration is the ultimate goal, we used MR guided MR biopsy imaging data from six consecutive patients for this evaluation. The data included T2-weighted images (0.8x0.8x3.0 mm) before and after insertion of a needle guide causing deformation of the prostate. The needle guide had an orientation and dimension comparable to a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) probe. The prostate in the two images was segmented and corresponding surface meshes were generated in both images by assuming identical prostate orientations. Next, a tetrahedral volume mesh was generated from the image before needle insertion. Prostate deformations due to needle insertion were simulated using the surface displacements as boundary condition. A 3D thin-plate spline deformation field was calculated by registering the mesh vertices. The TRE was defined as the Euclidean distance between registered and reference landmark position and was calculated for 45 reference landmarks manually annotated in both T2-weighted images. The results of this automated method were also compared to previous results obtained with manual optimization. RESULTS The median TRE of the automated surface-based registration method with biomechanical regularization was 2.21 mm (range 0.55-7.32 mm), which was significantly lower than a median TRE of 3.02 mm (range 0.85-7.95 mm) obtained without biomechanical regularization (P<0.01). The median TRE of the automated method is higher than the previous result of 1.88 mm, but not significantly different (P=0.10). CONCLUSION Non-rigid surface-based image registration extended with biomechanical modeling can be automated and improves the registration accuracy for prostate MR guided biopsies. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION The automated surface-based registration method extended with biomechanical modeling is applicable to MR-TRUS registration and can help to improve effectiveness of MR guided TRUS biopsy procedures.},

  booktitle = ECR,
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {PURPOSE To investigate the accuracy of image-guided TRUS biopsy using rigid electro-magnetic (EM) tracker-based registration for real-time image fusion. METHOD AND MATERIALS An ultrasound (US) system equipped with Smart Fusion (Toshiba Aplio 500) was available that spatially correlates imported 3D MR/CT images with real-time US using an EM tracker. Smart Fusion is a twostep process. First, the MR/CT image plane orientation is matched to the US scanning angle. Secondly, the in-plane position is linked by selecting one matching reference landmark in both images. Live US and reformatted MR/CT image are shown simultaneously, allowing MR/CT image-guided biopsy. Local registration accuracy can be enhanced by selecting the reference landmark near the target. Registration accuracy was evaluated on a prostate phantom. A pre-acquired CT image was imported before TRUS examination. Accuracy was evaluated on 2D slices by three measures: target registration error (TRE, distance between lesion centers on both modalities); lesion contour overlap; and ratio between lesion contour areas on both modalities. The complete fusion procedure was repeated 15 times. MR guided TRUS prostate biopsy was performed in a patient with two prior negative TRUS biopsies and a PI-RADS 5 transitional zone lesion of 10mm. RESULTS In the phantom, mean in-plane TRE was 1.42A,A+-1.10mm; mean contour overlap was 62.1A,A+-21.5%; and mean contour area ratio was 93.1A,A+-19.6%. Biopsy pathology was Gleason 3+3 and considered representative. CONCLUSION The two-step EM tracker-based registration can be accurate if reference landmarks are selected near the target. MR guided TRUS prostate biopsy of sufficiently large lesions may be feasible.},

In contrast to conventional whole gland fusion, local reference augmentation focuses the highest registration accuracy to the region surrounding the lesion to be biopsied. Pre-acquired multi-parametric MR images (mpMRI) were evaluated using PIRADS classification. T2-weighted MR images were imported on an ultrasound machine to allow for MR-TRUS fusion. Biopsies were targeted to the most suspicious lesion area identified on mpMRI. Each target was biopsied 1-5 times. For each biopsied lesion the diameter, PIRADS and Gleason scores, visibility during fusion, and representativeness were recorded.Included were 23 consecutive patients with 25 MR suspicious lesions, of which 11 patients had a previous negative TRUS-guided biopsy and 12 were biopsy naive. The cancer detection rate was 64 (Gleason score 6). Biopsy was negative (i.e., no Gleason score) in seven patients confirmed by follow-up in all of them (up to 18 months). After MR-TRUS fusion, 88 of the lesions could be visualized on TRUS. The cancer detection rate increases with increasing lesion size, being 73 for lesions larger than 10mm.Tracker-based MR-TRUS fusion biopsy with local reference augmentation is feasible, especially for lesions with an MR maximum diameter of at least 10mm or PIRADS 5 lesions.

                             We performed a comparison of csPCa detection rates between FGB and MRGB. Included patients had (1) at least one prior negative TRUS biopsy; (2) a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 4 or 5 lesion and (3) a lesion size of >=8 mm measured in at least one direction. We considered a Gleason score >=7 being csPCa. Descriptive statistics with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to determine any differences.

                             We included 51 patients with FGB (59 PI-RADS 4 and 41% PI-RADS 5) and 227 patients with MRGB (34 PI-RADS 4 and 66% PI-RADS 5). Included patients had a median age of 69 years (IQR, 65-72) and a median PSA level of 11.0 ng/ml (IQR, 7.4-15.1) and a median age of 67 years (IQR, 61-70), the median PSA 12.8 ng/ml (IQR, 9.1-19.0) within the FGB and the MRGB group, respectively.

  doi = {10.1016/j.euf.2016.07.003},
  pages = {219-227},
  volume = {4},
  abstract = {CONTEXT: The main difference between the available magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound (MRI-TRUS) fusion platforms for prostate biopsy is the method of image registration being either rigid or elastic. As elastic registration compensates for possible deformation caused by the introduction of an ultrasound probe for example, it is expected that it would perform better than rigid registration.
                             OBJECTIVE: The aim of this meta-analysis is to compare rigid with elastic registration by calculating the detection odds ratio (OR) for both subgroups. The detection OR is defined as the ratio of the odds of detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) by MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy compared with systematic TRUS biopsy. Secondary objectives were the OR for any PCa and the OR after pooling both registration techniques.
                             EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The electronic databases PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were systematically searched for relevant studies according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Statement. Studies comparing MRI-TRUS fusion and systematic TRUS-guided biopsies in the same patient were included. The quality assessment of included studies was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2.
                             EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Eleven papers describing elastic and 10 describing rigid registration were included. Meta-analysis showed an OR of csPCa for elastic and rigid registration of 1.45 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21-1.73, p<0.0001) and 1.40 (95% CI: 1.13-1.75, p=0.002), respectively. No significant difference was seen between the subgroups (p=0.83). Pooling subgroups resulted in an OR of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.25-1.63, p<0.00001).
                             CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was identified between rigid and elastic registration for MRI-TRUS fusion-guided biopsy in the detection of csPCa; however, both techniques detected more csPCa than TRUS-guided biopsy alone.
                             PATIENT SUMMARY: We did not identify any significant differences in prostate cancer detection between two distinct magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion systems which vary in their method of compensating for prostate deformation.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Central serous chorioretinopathy ({CSC}) is an ocular disorder characterized by serous retinal detachment and associated with fluid accumulation beneath the retina. Obtaining accurate measures on the size and volume of the fluid deposit may be an important biomarker to assess disease progression and treatment outcome. We developed a system for automatic volumetric quantification of subretinal fluid in optical coherence tomography ({OCT}). Methods: OCT images obtained from 15 patients with varying presence of subretinal fluid were selected from the clinic. A 3D region growing based algorithm was developed to segment the fluid after selecting an arbitrary seed point located in the fluid deposit. The obtained total volume, and the extent of the segmented fluid volume were compared to manual delineations made by two experienced human graders. Results: A high intra-class correlation coefficient ({ICC}) value (0.997) was obtained when comparing the fluid volume calculated by the proposed method with the volume delineated by the two graders. Similarly, the spatial overlap agreement on the obtained volumes, measured with the Dice similarity coefficient ({DC}), between the manual delineations and the software output was high ({DC}=0.87) and comparable to the overlap agreement between observersAC/a,!a,,C/ delineations ({DC}=0.85). In addition, the quantification time was reduced substantially by a factor of 5 compared to manual assessment. The quantified values obtained by the algorithm were shown to be highly reproducible, obtaining a {DC} value of 0.99 and an ICC value of 0.98 when varying the seed point used for initializing the algorithm. Conclusions: An image analysis algorithm for the automatic quantification of subretinal fluid in {OCT} images of {CSC} patients was developed. The proposed algorithm is able to accurately quantify the extent of fluid deposits in a fast and reproducible manner, allowing accurate assessment of disease progression and treatment outcome.},

  abstract = {Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a common eye disorder with high prevalence in elderly people. The disease mainly affects the central part of the retina, and could ultimately lead to permanent vision loss. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is becoming the standard imaging modality in diagnosis of AMD and the assessment of its progression. However, the evaluation of the obtained volumetric scan is time consuming, expensive and the signs of early AMD are easy to miss. In this paper we propose a classification method to automatically distinguish AMD patients from healthy subjects with high accuracy. The method is based on an unsupervised feature learning approach, and processes the complete image without the need for an accurate pre-segmentation of the retina. The method can be divided in two steps: an unsupervised clustering stage that extracts a set of small descriptive image patches from the training data, and a supervised training stage that uses these patches to create a patch occurrence histogram for every image on which a random forest classifier is trained. Experiments using 384 volume scans show that the proposed method is capable of identifying AMD patients with high accuracy, obtaining an area under the Receiver Operating Curve of 0:984. Our method allows for a quick and reliable assessment of the presence of AMD pathology in OCT volume scans without the need for accurate layer segmentation algorithms.},

Automated computer-aided detection and diagnosis~({CAD}) systems capable of detecting, classifying and quantifying the characteristics of the pathology associated with these retinal diseases is highly beneficial in the diagnosis, treatment prediction and the assessment of treatment progression. Among others, the presence of retinal cysts are an important biomarker in AMD and RVO, thus their detection and segmentation is beneficial to clinical disease analysis. Optical Coherence Tomography ({OCT}) imaging has the ability to visualize and analyze the morphology of the retina, as well as its abnormalities. Due to the technological advances in OCT imaging with regard to imaging speed, image quality, and functional analysis, OCT is rapidly becoming one of the main imaging modalities used in clinical practice, and for the quantification and analysis of disease-specific biomarkers such as cyst volume. In this work we propose a fully automatic CAD system for retinal cyst segmentation in OCT volume scans. The system is capable of detecting cysts in OCT volumes acquired with OCT scanners from different vendors, for which the amount of noise, image quality and contrast varies strongly.},

  title = {Fully automated quantification of intraretinal cysts in 3D optical coherence tomography},
  abstract = {Purpose: In age-related macular degeneration (AMD) the presence of intraretinal cysts is an important prognostic biomarker. Optical coherence tomography imaging has shown to be capable of accurately visualizing and characterizing the three-dimensional shape and extent of cysts. The detection and quantification of intraretinal cysts is highly beneficial for the prediction of treatment outcome and the assessment of the treatment progression. To aid the clinician with quantified information regarding cysts, we developed a fully automated system capable of detecting and delineating intraretinal cysts in 3D optical coherence tomography images.Methods: For this study a total of 30 OCT volumes acquired using four different brand OCT scanners were provided by the OPTIMA cyst segmentation challenge, containing a wide variety of retinal cysts together with manual cyst delineations. A pixel classifier based on a multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to predict if an image pixel belongs to a cyst or to the background by considering a small neighborhood around the pixel of interest. The CNN follows a two stage approach, where in the first stage, multiple CNN's are used in parallel to obtain a segmentation at different image scales. In the second stage, the individual segmentations are merged, combining local information obtained with the lower scale network with contextual information obtained from the higher scale networks. After providing the neural network with enough training samples, the network can automatically detect and segment cysts in OCT volumes. The obtained segmentations were compared to manual delineations made by two experienced human graders. Results: The spatial overlap agreement on the obtained volumes, measured by the Dice similarity coefficient, between the manual delineations and the software output was 0.55, which is substantial considering the difficulty of the task. In addition, the quantification time was reduced dramatically, and takes only a few seconds for a complete OCT volume. Conclusions: An image analysis algorithm for the automatic quantification of intraretinal cysts in OCT images was developed. The proposed algorithm is able to detect and quantify the three dimensional shape and extent of cysts in a fast and reproducible manner, allowing accurate assessment of disease progression and treatment outcome.},

  title = {Fully automated detection of hyperreflective foci in optical coherence tomography},
  abstract = {Purpose: Diabetic macular edema ({DME}) is a retinal disorder characterized by a buildup of cystoidal fluid in the retina.
                             The typical treatment consists of monthly intravitreal anti vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections.
                             However, the efficacy of this treatment varies strongly.
                             Recent studies have indicated that the presence and number of hyperreflective foci can possibly be considered a prognostic biomarker for treatment response in {DME}.
                             As the detection of foci is difficult and time-consuming manual foci quantification seems infeasible.
                             We therefore developed a fully automated system capable of detecting and quantifying foci in optical coherence tomography ({OCT}) images.
                             Methods:
                              119 fovea centered B-scans obtained from 49 patients with {DME} were selected from a clinical database.
                             The data was divided in a training set of 96 {B}-scans from 40 patients, and a test set containing 23 {B}-scans from 9 patients.
                             A convolutional neural network ({CNN}) was developed to predict if an image pixel belongs to a hyperreflective focus by considering a small neighborhood around the pixel of interest.
                             The {CNN} consists of 7 convolutional layers and 2 max pooling layers.
                             After providing the system with enough training samples, the network automatically detects pixels with a high probability of being part of a hyperreflective focus.
                             Connected detections are considered as a single detection.
                             The obtained results were compared to manual annotations made by two experienced human graders in consensus for the central 3 mm surrounding the fovea.
                             Hyperreflective foci were only annotated in the layers ranging from the inner plexiform layer ({IPL}) to the outer nuclear layer ({ONL}) as manual detection is challenging in the other layers.
                             When a detection is overlapping with an annotated focus it is considered a true positive, otherwise it is counted as a false positive.

                             Results:

                             In the independent test set a sensitivity of 0.83 was obtained.
                             At this level of sensitivity, an average of 8.3 false positives per {B}-scan were detected.
                             False positives were mainly caused by detections outside the selected range ({ILP} to {ONL}) and misdetections by the graders.

                             Conclusions:

                             An image analysis algorithm for the automatic detection and quantification of hyperreflective foci in {OCT} {B}-scans was developed.
                             The experiments show promising results to obtain quantitative foci based biomarkers that can be used for the prediction of treatment response in {DME}.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate a machine learning algorithm that automatically grades age-related macular degeneration (AMD) severity stages from optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans.
                             Methods: A total of 3265 {OCT} scans from 1016 patients with either no signs of {AMD} or with signs of early, intermediate, or advanced {AMD} were randomly selected from a large European multicenter database.
                             A machine learning system was developed to automatically grade unseen {OCT} scans into different {AMD} severity stages without requiring retinal layer segmentation.
                             The ability of the system to identify high-risk {AMD} stages and to assign the correct severity stage was determined by using receiver operator characteristic ({ROC}) analysis and {C}ohen's Kappa statistics, respectively.
                             The results were compared to those of two human observers.
                             Reproducibility was assessed in an independent, publicly available data set of 384 {OCT} scans.
                             Results:
                              The system achieved an area under the {ROC} curve of 0.980 with a sensitivity of 98.2% at a specificity of 91.2%.
                             This compares favorably with the performance of human observers who achieved sensitivities of 97.0% and 99.4% at specificities of 89.7% and 87.2%, respectively.
                             A good level of agreement with the reference was obtained (Kappa = 0.713) and was in concordance with the human observers (Kappa = 0.775 and Kappa = 0.755, respectively).
                             Conclusions:
                              A machine learning system capable of automatically grading {OCT} scans into {AMD} severity stages was developed and showed similar performance as human observers.
                             The proposed automatic system allows for a quick and reliable grading of large quantities of {OCT} scans, which could increase the efficiency of large-scale AMD studies and pave the way for {AMD} screening using {OCT}.},

  title = {Deep Learning for Lung Nodule Malignancy Prediction: Comparison With Clinicians and the Brock Model on an Independent Dataset From a Large Lung Screening Trial},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: The majority of studies on automated lung nodule malignancy prediction utilize subjective labels provided by radiologists instead of using a histopathological reference standard. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of a deep learning system that was trained using subjective labels from LIDC-IDRI by testing it on two independent datasets of nodules from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST) with histopathological proof or follow-up over a period of at least 2 years, and comparing performance with a panel of 11 clinicians and the clinically established Brock risk model. METHOD AND MATERIALS: We considered nodules annotated by at least 3 out of 4 radiologists from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The malignancy ratings were averaged and indeterminate nodules were excluded resulting in 680 nodules (352 benign and 328 malignant) for development. We trained a deep learning system based on 2D multi-view CNN and 3D extension of VGGNet on the development set. We tested the system on two sets of nodules from DLCST. The first set, dataset A, consisted of 62 cancers and 120 random benign nodules and the second set, dataset B, consisted of the same 62 cancers and a size-matched group of 118 benign nodules. A group of 11 clinicians, consisting of 4 radiologists, 5 radiology residents, and 2 pulmonologists, were tasked with grading the nodules on a continuous scale from 0 to 100. Finally, the Brock risk model was also applied to all nodules. RESULTS: On dataset A, the deep learning system produced an AUC of 0.941, which is better than the average clinician (0.892, p = 0.02) and comparable to the Brock model (0.924, p = 0.35). On dataset B, the system produced an AUC of 0.737, which is comparable to the Brock model (0.70, p = 0.268) but worse than the average clinician (0.80, p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: The deep learning system trained with subjective labels performed comparably with humans and the Brock model but showed certain vulnerabilities when presented with large benign nodules. It is important to recognize the challenges involved in classifying indeterminate lung nodules and we think the field would benefit from publicly available datasets with a reference standard set by histopathological proof or follow-up.},

Purpose To develop and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm for malignancy risk estimation of pulmonary nodules detected at screening CT. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, the DL algorithm was developed with 16 077 nodules (1249 malignant) collected -between 2002 and 2004 from the National Lung Screening Trial. External validation was performed in the following three -cohorts -collected between 2004 and 2010 from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial: a full cohort containing all 883 nodules (65 -malignant) and two cancer-enriched cohorts with size matching (175 nodules, 59 malignant) and without size matching (177 -nodules, 59 malignant) of benign nodules selected at random. Algorithm performance was measured by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared with that of the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer (PanCan) model in the full cohort and a group of 11 clinicians composed of four thoracic radiologists, five radiology residents, and two pulmonologists in the cancer-enriched cohorts. Results The DL algorithm significantly outperformed the PanCan model in the full cohort (AUC, 0.93 [95% CI: 0.89, 0.96] vs 0.90 [95% CI: 0.86, 0.93];   = .046). The algorithm performed comparably to thoracic radiologists in cancer-enriched cohorts with both random benign nodules (AUC, 0.96 [95% CI: 0.93, 0.99] vs 0.90 [95% CI: 0.81, 0.98];   = .11) and size-matched benign nodules (AUC, 0.86 [95% CI: 0.80, 0.91] vs 0.82 [95% CI: 0.74, 0.89];   = .26). Conclusion The deep learning algorithm showed excellent performance, comparable to thoracic radiologists, for malignancy risk estimation of pulmonary nodules detected at screening CT. This algorithm has the potential to provide reliable and reproducible malignancy risk scores for clinicians, which may help optimize management in lung cancer screening.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantify the added value of integrating a deep learning algorithm (DLA)'s output to the existing Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study (PanCan) models for estimating malignancy risk of screen-detected pulmonary nodules.
   METHODS AND MATERIALS: Our DLA was trained on a cohort of 14,828 benign and 1,249 malignant nodules from the National Lung Screening Trial. In the present study, we derived a new multivariable logistic regression model on the PanCan data that included the DLA risk score and the original variables from the PanCan model 2b except for "nodule type" and "spiculation" as these are already encoded in the DLA risk score. The new model was externally validated on baseline nodules from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST). For comparison, the performances of the existing PanCan model 2b and of our DLA stand-alone were also calculated.
   RESULTS: 6024 benign and 86 malignant nodules from the PanCan data were included as the development set, and 818 benign and 34 malignant nodules from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST) were included as the validation set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the DLA, PanCan model 2b, and the new model in the PanCan cohort were 0.944 (95% confidence interval = 0.917 - 0.968), 0.941 (0.908 - 0.969), and 0.944 (0.909 - 0.975), respectively. In the DLCST cohort, the AUCs were 0.917 (0.851 - 0.968), 0.896 (0.841 - 0.944), and 0.927 (0.878 - 0.969), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using our DLA risk score to derive a new multivariable logistic regression model on the PanCan data does not appear to significantly improve the predictive performance in high-risk screening participants, but may serve as a replacement for the "nodule type" and "spiculation" parameters that are known to have substantial interobserver variability.
   CLINICAL RELEVANCE / APPLICATION: Our DLA has a comparable nodule malignancy risk estimation performance to the PanCan models. This may help to make the computation of nodule risk scores easier and less subjective.},

  title = {Deep learning for estimating pulmonary nodule malignancy risk using prior CT examinations in lung cancer screening},
  abstract = {Purpose or Learning Objective: Nodule size, morphology, and growth are important factors for accurately estimating nodule malignancy risk in lung cancer screening CT examinations. In this work, we aimed to develop a deep learning (DL) algorithm that uses a current and a prior CT examination to estimate the malignancy risk of pulmonary nodules.

   Methods or Background: We developed a dual time-point DL algorithm by stacking the nodules from the current and prior CT examinations in the input channels of convolutional neural networks. We used 3,011 nodules (286 malignant) and 994 nodules (73 malignant) as development and hold-out test cohorts from the National Lung Screening Trial, respectively. The reference standard was set by histopathologic confirmation or CT follow-up of more than two years. We compared the performance of the algorithm against PanCan model 2b and a previously published single time-point DL algorithm that only processed a single CT examination. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to measure discrimination performance and a standard permutation test with 10,000 random permutations to compute p-values.

   Results or Findings: The dual time-point DL algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91 - 0.97) on the hold-out test cohort. The algorithm outperformed the single time-point DL algorithm and the PanCan model, which had AUCs of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89 - 0.95; p = 0.055) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85 - 0.91; p < 0.001), respectively.

   Conclusion: Deep learning algorithms using current and prior CT examinations have the potential to accurately estimate the malignancy risk of pulmonary nodules.

   Limitations: External validation is needed on other screening datasets to generate further evidence.

   Ethics committee approval: Institutional review board approval was obtained at each of the 33 centers involved in the NLST.

                             Methods: 1,264 OCT volumes from 633 patients from the European Genetic Database (EUGENDA) were graded as one of five stages of AMD (No AMD, Early AMD, Intermediate AMD, Advanced AMD: GA, and Advanced AMD: CNV). Ten different 3D DenseNet-121 models that take a full OCT volume as input were used to predict the corresponding AMD stage. These networks were all trained on the same dataset. However, each of these networks were initialized differently. The class with the maximum average softmax output of these models was used as the final prediction. The confidence measure was the normalized average softmax output for that class.

                             Results: The algorithm achieved an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic of 0.9785 and a quadratic-weighted kappa score of 0.8935. The mean uncertainty, calculated as 1 - the mean confidence score, for incorrect predictions was 1.9 times as high as the mean uncertainty for correct predictions. When only using the probability output of a single network, this ratio was 1.4. Another measure for uncertainty estimation performance is the Expected Calibration Error (ECE), where a lower value is better. When comparing the method to the probability output of a single network, the ECE improved from 0.0971 to 0.0324. Figure 1 shows examples of both confident and unconfident predictions.

                             Conclusions: We present a method for improving uncertainty estimation for AMD grading in OCT, by combining the output of multiple individually trained CNNs. This increased reliability of system confidences can contribute to building trust in CNNs for retinal disease screening. Furthermore, this technique is a first step towards selective prediction in retinal disease screening, where only cases with high uncertainty predictions need to be referred for expert evaluation.},

  abstract = {Amidst the ongoing pandemic, the assessment of computed tomography (CT) images for COVID-19 presence can exceed the workload capacity of radiologists. Several studies addressed this issue by automating COVID-19 classification and grading from CT images with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Many of these studies reported initial results of algorithms that were assembled from commonly used components. However, the choice of the components of these algorithms was often pragmatic rather than systematic and systems were not compared to each other across papers in a fair manner. We systematically investigated the effectiveness of using 3D CNNs instead of 2D CNNs for seven commonly used architectures, including DenseNet, Inception, and ResNet variants. For the architecture that performed best, we furthermore investigated the effect of initializing the network with pre-trained weights, providing automatically computed lesion maps as additional network input, and predicting a continuous instead of a categorical output. A 3D DenseNet-201 with these components achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.930 on our test set of 105 CT scans and an AUC of 0.919 on a publicly available set of 742 CT scans, a substantial improvement in comparison with a previously published 2D CNN. output contributed the least to improving the model performance. This paper provides insights into the performance benefits of various components for COVID-19 classification and grading systems. We have created a challenge on grand-challenge.org to allow for a fair comparison between the results of this and future research.},

  title = {Making AI Transferable Across OCT Scanners from Different Vendors},
  abstract = {Purpose: Deep neural networks (DNNs) for optical coherence tomography (OCT) classification have been proven to work well on images from scanners that were used during training. However, since the appearance of OCT scans can differ greatly between vendors, these DNNs often fail when they are applied to scans from different manufacturers. We propose a DNN architecture for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) grading that maintains performance on OCTs from vendors not included during training.

     Methods: 2,598 and 680 Heidelberg Spectralis OCT scans from the European Genetic Database were used for development and testing, respectively. We tested transferability with 339 AMD-enriched Topcon OCTs from the Rotterdam Study. AMD severity classification was determined manually in accordance with the Cologne Image Reading Center and Laboratory and Rotterdam Classification, respectively. Classifications were harmonized for the evaluation of the DNNs. The proposed DNN considers each B-scan separately using a 2D ResNet-18, and internally combines the intermediate outputs related to each B-scan using a multiple instance learning approach. Even though the proposed DNN provides both B-scan level and OCT-volume level decisions, the architecture is trained end-to-end using only full volume gradings. This specific architecture makes our method robust to the variability of scanning protocols across vendors, as it is invariant to B-scan spacing. We compare this approach to a baseline that classifies the full OCT scan directly using a 3D ResNet-18.

     Results: The quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) for the baseline method dropped from 0.852 on the Heidelberg Spectralis dataset to 0.523 on the Topcon dataset. This QWK drop was smaller (p = 0.001) for our approach, which dropped from 0.849 to 0.717. The difference in area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC) drop was also smaller (p < 0.001) for our approach (0.969 to 0.906, -6.5%) than for the baseline method (0.971 to 0.806, -17.0%).

     Conclusions: We present a DNN for AMD classification on OCT scans that transfers well to scans from vendors that were not used for development. This alleviates the need for retraining on data from these scanner types, which is an expensive process in terms of data acquisition, model development, and human annotation time. Furthermore, this increases the applicability of AI for OCT classification in broader scopes than the settings in which they were developed.},

  title = {Deep Learning for Fracture Detection in the Radius and Ulna on Conventional Radiographs},
  abstract = {This work gives a compartmentalized overview of a fracture detection tool to detect and localize fractures in the radius and ulna on conventional radiographs using deep learning.
    This contrasts earlier studies in that it proposes a more efficient object detector, demonstrates the generalizability of fracture detection models to data from a different hospital, and employs more advanced class activation mapping methods for fracture localization.
    Both RadboudUMC and the Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis provided data to create a multi-institutional dataset.
    The two data sources enabled me to demonstrate how fracture detection classifiers trained on data from only one institution significantly perform less when tested on data from another institution.
    Moreover, this study demonstrates a more efficient bone localization method that yields adequate performance to be used for cropping regions of interest, and a newer fracture localization method (ScoreCAM) that outperforms its predecessors in terms of highlighting less redundant information.
    I conclude that the algorithms presented in this work show the potential to be incorporated in a clinically usable fracture detection tool.
    However, more research needs to be conducted using multi-institutional for training fracture detection classifiers.},

  abstract = {Tumor proliferation is an important biomarker indicative of the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Assessment of tumor proliferation in a clinical setting is a highly subjective and labor-intensive task. Previous efforts to automate tumor proliferation assessment by image analysis only focused on mitosis detection in predefined tumor regions. However, in a real-world scenario, automatic mitosis detection should be performed in whole-slide images (WSIs) and an automatic method should be able to produce a tumor proliferation score given a WSI as input. To address this, we organized the TUmor Proliferation Assessment Challenge 2016 (TUPAC16) on prediction of tumor proliferation scores from WSIs. The challenge dataset consisted of 500 training and 321 testing breast cancer histopathology WSIs. In order to ensure fair and independent evaluation, only the ground truth for the training dataset was provided to the challenge participants. The first task of the challenge was to predict mitotic scores, i.e., to reproduce the manual method of assessing tumor proliferation by a pathologist. The second task was to predict the gene expression based PAM50 proliferation scores from the WSI. The best performing automatic method for the first task achieved a quadratic-weighted Cohen's kappa score of k = 0.567, 95% CI [0.464, 0.671] between the predicted scores and the ground truth. For the second task, the predictions of the top method had a Spearman's correlation coefficient of r = 0.617, 95% CI [0.581 0.651] with the ground truth. This was the first comparison study that investigated tumor proliferation assessment from WSIs. The achieved results are promising given the difficulty of the tasks and weakly-labeled nature of the ground truth. However, further research is needed to improve the practical utility of image analysis methods for this task.},

  abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a disorder frequently found among the old people and is associated with deterioration in cognitive performance, parkinsonism, motor and mood impairments. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) as well as lacunes, microbleeds and subcortical brain atrophy are part of the spectrum of image findings, related to SVD. Accurate segmentation of WMHs is important for prognosis and diagnosis of multiple neurological disorders such as MS and SVD. Almost all of the published (semi-)automated WMH detection models employ multiple complex hand-crafted features, which require in-depth domain knowledge. In this paper we propose to apply a single-layer network unsupervised feature learning (USFL) method to avoid hand-crafted features, but rather to automatically learn a more efficient set of features. Experimental results show that a computer aided detection system with a USFL system outperforms a hand-crafted approach. Moreover, since the two feature sets have complementary properties, a hybrid system that makes use of both hand-crafted and unsupervised learned features, shows a significant performance boost compared to each system separately, getting close to the performance of an independent human expert.},

Bilateral activity is found in all parts of the ILBM during the double support phase. After right heel strike the right ILBM (and after left heel strike the left) show in most cases more activity than the contralateral ILBM. This is especially so in the intermediate and lateral columns, which consist mainly of the longissimus thoracis and the iliocostalis lumborum muscle and less so in the medial column, made up mainly by the multifidus and spinalis muscle. This difference is probably due to the difference in moment arm for the two directions. Pelvic rotations are described, but no evident relationships between pelvic rotations in the different planes and ILBM-activity could be seen, probably because the changes in the position of the torso are of more importance.},

  abstract = {To determine the influence of local contrast optimisation on diagnostic accuracy and perceived suspiciousness of digital screening mammograms.Data were collected from a screening region in the Netherlands and consisted of 263 digital screening cases (153 recalled,110 normal). Each case was available twice, once processed with a tissue equalisation (TE) algorithm and once with local contrast optimisation (PV). All cases had digitised previous mammograms. For both algorithms, the probability of malignancy of each finding was scored independently by six screening radiologists. Perceived case suspiciousness was defined as the highest probability of malignancy of all findings of a radiologist within a case. Differences in diagnostic accuracy of the processing algorithms were analysed by comparing the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (A(z)). Differences in perceived case suspiciousness were analysed using sign tests.There was no significant difference in A(z) (TE: 0.909, PV 0.917, P = 0.46). For all radiologists, perceived case suspiciousness using PV was higher than using TE more often than vice versa (ratio: 1.14-2.12). This was significant (P <0.0083) for four radiologists.Optimisation of local contrast by image processing may increase perceived case suspiciousness, while diagnostic accuracy may remain similar.Variations among different image processing algorithms for digital screening mammography are large. Current algorithms still aim for optimal local contrast with a low dynamic range. Although optimisation of contrast may increase sensitivity, diagnostic accuracy is probably unchanged. Increased local contrast may render both normal and abnormal structures more conspicuous.},

  abstract = {Abstract In recent years, pulmonary imaging has seen enormous progress, with the introduction, validation and implementation of new hardware and software. There is a general trend from mere visual evaluation of radiological images to quantification of abnormalities and biomarkers, and assessment of 'non visual' markers that contribute to establishing diagnosis or prognosis. Important catalysts to these developments in thoracic imaging include new indications (like computed tomography [CT] lung cancer screening) and the COVID-19 pandemic. This review focuses on developments in CT, radiomics, artificial intelligence (AI) and x-ray velocimetry for imaging of the lungs. Recent developments in CT include the potential for ultra-low-dose CT imaging for lung nodules, and the advent of a new generation of CT systems based on photon-counting detector technology. Radiomics has demonstrated potential towards predictive and prognostic tasks particularly in lung cancer, previously not achievable by visual inspection by radiologists, exploiting high dimensional patterns (mostly texture related) on medical imaging data. Deep learning technology has revolutionized the field of AI and as a result, performance of AI algorithms is approaching human performance for an increasing number of specific tasks. X-ray velocimetry integrates x-ray (fluoroscopic) imaging with unique image processing to produce quantitative four dimensional measurement of lung tissue motion, and accurate calculations of lung ventilation.},

  abstract = {{I}n this study, computer-assisted analysis of prostate lesions was researched by combining information from two different magnetic resonance ({MR}) modalities: {T}2-weighted ({T}2-w) and dynamic contrast-enhanced ({DCE}) {T}1-w images. {T}wo issues arise when incorporating {T}2-w images in a computer-aided diagnosis ({CAD}x) system: {T}2-w values are position as well as sequence dependent and images can be misaligned due to patient movement during the acquisition. {A} method was developed that computes {T}2 estimates from a {T}2-w and proton density value and a known sequence model. {A} mutual information registration strategy was implemented to correct for patient movement. {G}lobal motion is modelled by an affine transformation, while local motion is described by a volume preserving non-rigid deformation based on {B}-splines. {T}he additional value to the discriminating performance of a {DCE} {T}1-w-based {CAD}x system was evaluated using bootstrapped {ROC} analysis. {T}2 estimates were successfully computed in 29 patients. {T}2 values were extracted and added to the {CAD}x system from 39 malignant, 19 benign and 29 normal annotated regions. {T}2 values alone achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.85 (0.77-0.92) and showed a significantly improved discriminating performance of 0.89 (0.81-0.95), when combined with {DCE} {T}1-w features. {I}n conclusion, the study demonstrated a simple {T}2 estimation method that has a diagnostic performance such that it complements a {DCE} {T}1-w-based {CAD}x system in discriminating malignant lesions from normal and benign regions. {A}dditionally, the {T}2 estimate is beneficial to visual inspection due to the removed coil profile and fixed window and level settings.},

Demontrate prostate cancer interpretation with histopathologic correlation 4. Train the radiologist in using the CAD system. 5. Investigate the effect of CAD on the discriminative performance of the radiologist. CONTENT ORGANIZATION The workstation enables joint analysis of anatomic, functional, metabolic MR imaging, CAD and structured reporting. Training cases are presented to instruct the radiologist how to use the system, how to interpret MR images and provide correlation with whole-mount step-section histology tumor maps. The radiologist can diagnose a number of test cases and use CAD as a 2nd opinion. The discriminative performance of the radiologist is presented along with added value of CAD. SUMMARY The clinical value of Multi-Modal MR imaging for diagnosing prostate cancer is demonstrated to the radiologist. Certain imaging features (alone or in combination) MRI can help to differentiate prostate cancer from benign cases such as prostatitis or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), but requires experience. The potential benefit of using CAD as a 2nd opinion is demonstrated in a clinical workflow setting.},

  abstract = {Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and remains the second leading cause of cancer death in men. In 2010, more than 217,000 men in the United States (US) were diagnosed with prostate cancer . The American Cancer Society estimated that approximately 32,000 men died from the disease in the US in 2010. In Europe, more than 338,00 males were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2008 and almost 71000 men died because of prostate cancer. The growth of the population and, more importantly, the aging population is a major cause of the high number of prostate cancer cases and will contribute to an increase in cancer burden. For that reason, there is a ongoing debate whether screening for prostate cancer should be performed. Screening can help find cancers in an early stage when they are more easily cured. An important trial to determine the effect of screening for breast cancer was performed between 1977 and 1984 in Sweden. The trial showed that after seven years of follow up a reduction of 31\% in breast cancer mortality was achieved when screening was applied. This led to the introduction of breast cancer screening in most western countries. Recently, several studies have been performed that looked at whether prostate cancer screening with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test saves lives. For example, the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) has shown significant reductions in PCa mortality in an intention-to-screen analysis. The reduction in mortality comes, however, at the price of over-diagnosis and over-treatment. In the study of Schr\"oder et al. the authors specifically warn that, in order to prevent one death from prostate cancer, 1410 men would need to be screened and 48 additional cases of prostate cancer would need to be treated. Hence, controversy still exists regarding the effectiveness of prostate cancer screening. The ongoing debate is essentially a public demand for a more reliable, non-invasive method that has a sufficiently high specificity in detecting prostate cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has evolved this decade to a competitive imaging modality for the localization of prostate cancer. The non-invasive nature and ability to provide structural, functional and metabolic information in a single examination makes the technique suitable to improve specificity when screening for prostate cancer. Many studies showed that multiparametric MRI, consisting of high resolution 3D T2-weighted sequences, 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI, 3D diffusion weighted imaging or spectroscopic imaging, leads to a sufficiently high accuracy for prostate cancer detection. Unfortunately, multiparametric MRI analysis requires a high level of expertise, suffers from observer variability and is a labor intensive procedure. For that reason the technique is considered cost inefficient and, as a result, has not been implemented in a screening environment. Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) can be of benefit to improve the consistency and accuracy of interpreting radiographic images by the radiologist. Additionally, it can speed up the reading time considerably. CAD research has been successfully pursued in other diagnostic areas such as mammography, CT chest, CT colonography as well as retinal imaging. However, published literature on prostate CAD research is still relatively immature. The motivation of this thesis was therefore to research state of the art CAD methods that can assist in a better diagnosis of prostate cancer, reduce the observer variability and be of benefit to a more efficient workflow for the radiologist.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a fully automatic computer-aided detection (CAD) method is proposed for the detection of prostate cancer. The CAD method consists of multiple sequential steps in order to detect locations that are suspicious for prostate cancer. In the initial stage, a voxel classification is performed using a Hessian-based blob detection algorithm at multiple scales on an apparent diffusion coefficient map. Next, a parametric multi-object segmentation method is applied and the resulting segmentation is used as a mask to restrict the candidate detection to the prostate. The remaining candidates are characterized by performing histogram analysis on multiparametric MR images. The resulting feature set is summarized into a malignancy likelihood by a supervised classifier in a two-stage classification approach. The detection performance for prostate cancer was tested on a screening population of 200 consecutive patients and evaluated using the free response operating characteristic methodology. The results show that the CAD method obtained sensitivities of 0.41, 0.65 and 0.74 at false positive (FP) levels of 1, 3 and 5 per patient, respectively. In conclusion, this study showed that it is feasible to automatically detect prostate cancer at a FP rate lower than systematic biopsy. The CAD method may assist the radiologist to detect prostate cancer locations and could potentially guide biopsy towards the most aggressive part of the tumour.},

Ninety-four patients with PCa who had undergone multiparametric MR imaging (MRI) before prostatectomy were included. Cancer was indicated on T2-weighted images, blinded to any functional data, with prostatectomy specimens as the reference standard. Tumors were classified as low grade or high grade based on Gleason score; peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) tumors were analyzed separately. In a development set (43 patients), the optimal combination of multiparametric MRI parameters was determined using logistic regression modeling. Subsequently, this combination was evaluated in a separate validation set (51 patients).In the PZ, the 25th percentile of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from diffusion-weighted imaging and washout (WO25) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI offered the optimal combination of parameters. In the TZ, WO25 and the choline over spermine + creatine ratio (C/SC) derived from MR spectroscopic imaging showed the highest discriminating performance. Using the models built with the development set, 48 (74\%) of 65 cancer lesions were classified correctly in the validation set.Multiparametric MRI is a useful tool for the discrimination between low-grade and high-grade PCa and performs better than any individual functional parameter in both the PZ and TZ. The 25th percentile of ADC + WO25 offered the optimal combination in the PZ, and the choline over spermine + creatine ratio + WO25 offered the optimal combination in the TZ. The ADC parameter has no additional value for the assessment of PCa aggressiveness in the TZ.},

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 5564 participants who underwent low-dose CT from the National Lung Screening Trial between August 2002 and April 2004, who were followed until December 2009. A deep learning network was trained to quantify six types of vascular calcification: thoracic aorta calcification (TAC); aortic and mitral valve calcification; and coronary artery calcification (CAC) of the left main, the left anterior descending, and the right coronary artery. TAC and CAC were determined in six evenly distributed slabs spatially aligned among chest CT images. CVD mortality prediction was performed with multivariable logistic regression using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The methods were compared with semiautomatic baseline prediction using self-reported participant characteristics, such as age, history of smoking, and history of illness. Statistical significance between the prediction models was tested using the nonparametric DeLong test. Results: The prediction model was trained with data from 4451 participants (median age, 61 years; 37.9\% women) and then tested on data from 1113 participants (median age, 61 years; 37.9\% women). The prediction model using calcium scores achieved a C statistic of 0.74 (95\% CI: 0.69, 0.79), and it outperformed the baseline model using only participant characteristics (C statistic, 0.69; P = .049). Best results were obtained when combining all variables (C statistic, 0.76; P < .001). Conclusion: Five-year CVD mortality prediction using automatically extracted image-based features is feasible at lung screening low-dose CT.},

  booktitle = ECR,

  abstract = {Purpose: Breast MRI is used to screen for breast cancer in women at elevated risk. However, contrary to common practice in mammography screening, no structural quality assessment of MRI screening is performed. The purpose of this audit was to evaluate the visibility of MR screen-detected cancers on prior MR examinations. Methods and Materials: Patient files from all women who were diagnosed with breast cancer after a positive MRI screen between 2003 and 201 3 were reviewed. We selected all cases where a previous MR examination was performed between 6 and 24 months before detection. This yielded 42 cancers (3 lobular-, 38 ductal carcinomas, 1 secretory carcinoma) in 40 women (1 bilateral, mean age 50 years A,A+- 9.7 years). The diagnostic and prior MRI studies were evaluated side-by-side in consensus by two dedicated breast radiologists. The visibility of the cancers on the prior scans was rated as: Visible (BIRADS 4/5), Minimal sign (BIRADS 2/3), and Occult (BIRADS 1). Results: The mean interval between the prior and diagnostic MRI was 1 1 .9 months A,A+- 3.3 months. All 42 lesions were identified on the diagnostic scans. Eleven lesions (26%) were visible in the prior MRI and should have already been recalled. Thirteen lesions (31 %) showed a minimal sign in the prior MRI. Only 18 lesions (43%) were completely occult. Conclusion: In 26% of cases, evident lesions were missed in prior MRI screening exams. To prevent these errors structural double reading of MR screening examinations may be indicated.},

                             The purpose of this study was to evaluate the visibility of MR screen detected cancers on prior MR examinations in a population with an elevated risk for breast cancer.

                             METHOD AND MATERIALS
                             An IRB approved, retrospective review of patient files from women screened with breast MRI between 2003 and 2013 was conducted at our academic center. We selected all cases detected in MRI with a prior negative MR examination performed between 6 and 24 months before a cancer was revealed (mean: 12.8 A-A?A 1/2  3.7 months). This yielded 43 cancers (3 invasive lobular-, 33 invasive ductal carcinomas, 5 ductal carcinoma in situ and 2 others) in 41 patients (age: 49 A-A?A 1/2  9.8 years, 21 BRCA patients). The MR scans where the cancers were detected (diagnostic MR scan) and the prior MR scans were evaluated side-by-side in consensus by two dedicated breast radiologists. The visibility of the cancers on prior scans was rated as: visible (BIRADS 4/5), minimal sign (BIRADS 2/3), or invisible (BIRADS 1). Chi-square tests were used to test the correlation between patient and cancer characteristics, image quality (IQ), background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), and visibility of the tumor in the prior MR scan.

                             RESULTS
                             All lesions were retrospectively evident on the diagnostic MR scan. Review of the prior examinations of the 43 cancers detected in follow-up rounds revealed that 11 lesions (26%) were visible in the prior MRI and should have been recalled at the time of this scan. 15 lesions (35%) showed a minimal sign in the prior MRI. Only 17 lesions (40%) were completely invisible. High grade, ER negative, and PR negative tumors were more often invisible in the prior scan (p=0.016, p=0.005, and p=0.002). Moreover, tumors in BRCA patients were more likely to be invisible in the prior scan, than in non-BRCA carriers (p=0.025). IQ and BPE were not significantly related to the visibility of tumors in the prior scan.

                             CONCLUSION
                             About 26% of the breast cancers could have been recalled earlier and only 40% of the breast cancers were invisible in retrospect.

                             CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION
                             To prevent screening errors regular auditing of clinical practice is indicated. Moreover, like in mammography, structural double reading of MRI screening examinations may be recommended.},

  year = {2015},
  abstract = {PURPOSE
                             Breast cancer screening in women at elevated risk is performed with yearly MRI and mammography. This includes women with BRCA mutations and women at elevated risk for other causes (mainly family history). The purpose of this study was to assess differences between BRCA mutation carriers and non-BRCA patients in a longitudinal MRI screening program in terms of recall rate, positive predictive value, and detection.

                             METHOD AND MATERIALS
                             An IRB approved, retrospective review of patient files from women screened with breast MRI between 2003 and 2013 was performed at our academic center. We analysed 9.504 screening MR examinations in 2843 women (age: 45 A-A?A 1/2  12.09 years), including 761 BRCA patients, and 2082 non-BRCA patients. Recall rate (RR), positive predictive value (PPV), and cancer detection rate (CDR) were evaluated for first round examinations and follow-up examinations separately. BRCA patients were compared with non-BRCA patients. Chi-square tests were used to determine statistical significance.

                             RESULTS
                             The RR for BRCA patients in the first round of screening was 86.07 per 1000 examinations and 52.58 per 1000 examinations in non-BRCA patients (p<0.001). The PPV for BRCA patients in the first round of screening was found to be 0.44, compared to 0.50 in non-BRCA patients (p=0.013). The CDR was 38.25 per 1000 examinations for BRCA patients and 26.53 per 1000 examinations for non-BRCA patients (p<0.001). In follow up, the RR was found to be 24.92 per 1000 examinations for BRCA patients and 22.81 per 1000 examinations for non-BRCA patients (p<0.001). The PPV was 0.46 for BRCA patients and 0.21 for non-BRCA patients (p<0.001). CDR was 11.42 per 1000 examinations for BRCA patients and 4.86 per 1000 examinations for non-BRCA patients (p<0.001).

                             CONCLUSION
                             RR and CDR are high for all patients in the first round. RR and CDR significantly decreased in follow-up rounds (p<0.001). PPV remained at an acceptable level for both patient groups, and remains particularly high in BRCA carriers. RR, PPV, and CDR differed significantly between BRCA and non-BRCA patients in both first and follow up rounds.

                             CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION
                             These results underline that MRI is an excellent tool for screening high risk patients. Cancer detection is very high in the first round in all patients, but remains high only in BRCA carriers in follow up rounds.},

  abstract = {Synopsis: Women at increased risk for breast cancer require annual mammography and MRI. The purpose of this study is to evaluate cancers detected in MRI screening and assess the visibility on prior MRI-examinations. MRI-scans of breast cancers detected in our MRI screening program were re-evaluated and lesions on the diagnostic MRI and prior MRI were scored according to Breast Imaging Reporting and Data (BI-RADS) MR-lexicon. The visibility of the lesions on the prior MRI was rated as visible, minimal sign and invisible. Our results show that almost one third of the breast cancers should have been recalled based on consensus review.
                             Purpose:
                             Breast cancer is a main cause of cancer death, especially in women at increased risk for breast cancer. This risk is defined as a cumulative lifetime risk of more than 20%, and can be as high as 57% at the age of 70 in BRCA1-carriers.1 Screening with only mammography is insufficient in these women and supplemental annual breast MRI is currently required.2 In mammography screening it is regular practice to evaluate breast cancers detected in incident screening rounds and cancers detected in between screening round (interval cancers), and assess whether these cancers could have been detected earlier.3,4 This is rare for MRI screening. The purpose of this study is to evaluate breast cancers detected in an intermediate and high risk screening program, and assess the visibility of these cancers on prior MRI examinations. To detect possible causes for non-recall, we investigated imaging, patient, and cancer characteristics.
                             Methods:
                             This retrospective study was approved by our local institutional board and the requirement for informed consent was waived. We collected all breast MRI screening examinations in the period from January 2003 - January 2014. To find all malignant lesions in this population, corresponding patient files were linked to the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR). For each patient with breast cancer detected on an MRI-screen or interval cancer, we identified whether another MRI-screen in 6 - 24 months before cancer detection was available (prior MRI). These MRI-scans were re-evaluated together with the MRI-scan in which cancer was detected (diagnostic MRI) in consensus by two radiologists with 8 and 12 years experience. The review was performed on an in-house developed breast MRI workstation, which provided T1-weighted images for all time points for both current and prior DCE-MRI, subtraction images, and their maximum intensity projection. Images were motion corrected using an algorithm described in Gubern-MA-A?A 1/2 rida et al.5 No T2-weighted images or diffusion-weighted images were shown. On the diagnostic MRI morphological and enhancement characteristics of the known cancer were scored according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data (BI-RADS) MR-lexicon.6 In addition, background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) was scored as minimal (<25%), mild (25-50%), moderate (50-75%) or marked (>75%), and image quality (IQ) was scored as perfect, sufficient or bad. Thereafter, the prior MRI was analyzed. The visibility of the lesion, previously identified in the diagnostic MRI, was rated as visible (BI-RADS 4/5), minimally visible (BI-RADS 2/3), or invisible (BI-RADS 1) (Fig.1). In lesions classified as visible or minimally visible morphology and enhancement characteristics were scored. Pearsons chi-square tests were used to test if imaging, patient, and cancer characteristics affect the visibility of the tumor on the prior MRI. Statistics were performed in SPSS.
                             Results:
                             From January 2003 - January 2014, 10120 MRI-examinations were performed in 2797 women, including 807 BRCA-mutation carriers. In total, 153 cancers were found. For 69 screen-detected tumors a prior MRI was available (36 tumors in patients with a BRCA mutation). In retrospect, 20 (29%) tumors were visible on the prior MRI, 26 (38%) showed a minimal sign, and 23 (33%) were invisible. Furthermore, prior MRIs were also available for 12 interval cancers (6 tumors in patients with a BRCA mutation); 3 (25%) were visible, 4 (33%) showed a minimal sign, and 5 (33%) were not visible on the prior MRI. Tumors in BRCA patients, small tumors, tumors of high grade and hormone-negative tumors were more likely to be invisible on the prior MRI (p<0.001, p=0.039, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). The lack of detection of lesions scored as visible on the prior MRI was not related to BPE or IQ.
                              Discussion:
                             A successful MRI screening program is based on the balance between the early detection and the false positive findings that result in unnecessary biopsies and anxiety. This might explain why not all visible lesions get recalled. However, in our study we show that almost one third of cancers were already visible on the prior MRI scan in retrospect and should have been recalled according to our consensus review. This fraction was similar for screen detected and interval cancers. A possible reason for the non-recall could be that the visible lesions were already present at an earlier time point and were regarded stable over time. Non-recall was not related to BPE or IQ.
                             Conclusion:
                             It was seen that 28% of breast cancers should have been recalled earlier based on consensus review. Only 35% was completely invisible in retrospect. This indicates that even highly specialized breast cancer screening programs can still be improved and that regular evaluation of screening practice is essential.

  title = {Differences between cancers detected in prophylactic mastectomy specimen, screen detected cancers and true interval cancers in women participating in an intermediate and high risk screening program},
  booktitle = EBCC,
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Background: Intensive screening with annual mammography and MRI is offered to women at high risk for the development of breast cancer. Although most cancers are screen detected, screening does not prevent breast cancers from occurring and some are still detected between screening rounds (true interval cancers). Consequently, some women opt for prophylactic mastectomy rather than intensive screening since this reduces the incidence of breast cancer. Unfortunately, detection of cancer in a prophylactic mastectomy specimen (incident cancers) is not a rare occurrence. It is unsure whether these cancers should be considered as interval cancers. This study evaluates the prognostic factors of cancers stratified by the mode of tumor detection in these women.
                             Material and methods: Review of our intermediate and high risk screening program from 2003 to 2013 identified 177 cancers. Of these, 136 were detected in screening, 15 cancers were true interval carcinomas detected due to symptoms, and 26 cancers were detected in prophylactic mastectomy specimens. Patient- and cancer characteristics (invasive versus in-situ disease, grade, pT-stage, age, menopausal state, cancer receptor status and pN-stage) between these three groups were compared using a Pearson's chi-square test for categorical variables or one-way ANOVA for continuous variables.
                             Results: The fraction of invasive disease was 8/26 (30.8%), 109/136 (80.1%) and 15/15 (100%) for cancers in prophylactic mastectomy specimens, screen detected cancers and interval cancers, respectively (p<0.001). The fraction of cancers larger than two centimeters was 1/26 (3.8%), 24/136 (17.6%) and 3/15 (20.0%), respectively. A similar increase was observed for the overall pT-stage (p<0.001). Moreover, tumor grade was higher in true interval cancers than in cancers detected in prophylactic mastectomy specimens (p=0.001). Most cancers were node negative (p=0.233). There were no significant differences in patient age, menopausal state, cancer receptor status, and pN-stage between true interval cancers and prophylactic mastectomy specimens.
                             Conclusions: True interval cancers are more often invasive, generally larger, and commonly of higher grade than screen detected cancers or cancers in prophylactic mastectomy specimens. The prognosis of cancers detected in prophylactic mastectomy specimens is particularly good as most of these lesions are in situ cancers only. Therefore, these incident cancers should not be regarded as interval cancers.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Women at increased risk for breast cancer are screened with annual MRI and mammography. However,

                             factors of interval carcinomas and compare these to prognostic factors of screen detected cancers.
                             Methods and Materials: In a review of our intermediate and high risk screening program from 2003 to 2013, 170
                             cancers in 159 women were identified. Of these, 14 cancers were true interval carcinomas presenting with symptoms,
                             and 132 were detected in screening. TwentyA-A?A 1/2 four further cancers were detected in prophylactic mastectomy
                             specimens, and were excluded from this study. PatientA-A?A 1/2  and cancer characteristics of screen detected cancers and
                             interval cancers were compared using a Pearson's chiA-A?A 1/2 squared test for categorical variables and a Student's tA-A?A 1/2 test for
                             continuous variables.
                             Results: Interval cancers occurred in younger patients (p=0.001), had a higher pTA-A?A 1/2 stage (p=0.046), and were more
                             often ERA-A?A 1/2 negative and PRA-A?A 1/2 negative (p=0.002, and p=0.002, respectively). Tumor grade appeared worse in interval
                             carcinomas and were more often invasive, but this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.062, and p=0.063,
                             respectively). HER2A-A?A 1/2 status was not significantly different. Fortunately, no difference was observed in pNA-A?A 1/2 stage or
                             presence of metastatic disease.
                             Conclusion: Interval cancers occurring in women participating in intensive surveillance programs are of more
                             aggressive nature than screen detected cancers. However, our results suggest that interval cancers are detected when
                             the disease is local. This still results in a relatively good prognosis for patients with interval cancer.},

                             cancer and has been associated to certain tumor characteristics. However, it is not known whether its presence is
                             related to tumor aggressiveness in high risk screening patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate this
                             association between BPE and tumor grade in high risk screen detected breast cancers.
                             Methods and Materials: Review of our intermediate and high risk screening program from 2003A-A?A 1/2 2013 identified MRIscans
                             of 80 cancers in 79 patients (48A-A?A 1/2 9.8 years) with biopsy proven unilateral cancer and no previous breast cancer.
                             The level of BPE in the contralateral breast was scored as minimal, mild, moderate, and marked by two readers (one
                             5th year resident (R1) and one experienced radiologist (R2)). Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for grade in relation to
                             BPE. Observer variability was computed using kappa statistics.
                             Results: A significant association was found between tumor grade and level of BPE in the contralateral breast for both
                             readers (the OR for high grade tumor was 0.394 (p=0.007) for R1 and 0.310 (p=0.002) for R2). After adjusting for
                             significant factors, the OR for high grade cancers was 0.924 for R1 and 2.066 for R2. Kappa value for BPE
                             assessment between readers was K=0.592.
                             Conclusion: Lower BPE might be associated to higher tumor grade, when only evaluating BPE. However, our results
                             suggest that other factors play a major role in this association. This limits the usefulness of BPE as a parameter for
                             therapy stratification.},

  abstract = {Ultrafast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the breast enables assessment of the contrast inflow dynamics while providing images with diagnostic spatial resolution. However, the slice thickness of common ultrafast techniques still prevents multiplanar reconstruction. In addition, some temporal blurring of the enhancement characteristics occurs in case view-sharing is used. We evaluate a prototype compressed-sensing volume-interpolated breath-hold examination (CS-VIBE) sequence for ultrafast breast MRI that improves through plane spatial resolution and avoids temporal blurring while maintaining an ultrafast temporal resolution (less than 5 seconds per volume). Image quality (IQ) of the new sequence is compared with an ultrafast view-sharing sequence (time-resolved angiography with interleaved stochastic trajectories [TWIST]), and assessment of lesion morphology is compared with a regular T1-weighted 3D Dixon sequence (VIBE-DIXON) with an acquisition time of 91 seconds. From April 2016 to October 2016, 30 women were scanned with the CS-VIBE sequence, replacing the routine ultrafast TWIST sequence in a hybrid breast MRI protocol. The need for informed consent was waived. All MRI scans were performed on a 3T MAGNETOM Skyra system (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) using a 16-channel bilateral breast coil. Two reader studies were conducted involving 5 readers. In the first study, overall IQ of CS-VIBE and TWIST in the axial plane was independently rated for 23 women for whom prior MRI examinations with TWIST were available. In addition, the presence of several types of artifacts was rated on a 5-point scale. The second study was conducted in women (n = 16) with lesions. In total, characteristics of 31 lesions (5 malignant and 26 benign) were described independently for CS-VIBE and VIBE-DIXON, according to the BI-RADS MRI-lexicon. In addition, a lesion conspicuity score was given. Using CS-VIBE, a much higher through-plane spatial resolution was achieved in the same acquisition time as with TWIST, without affecting in-plane IQ (P = 0.260). Time-resolved angiography with interleaved stochastic trajectories showed slightly more motion artifacts and infolding and ghosting artifacts compared with CS-VIBE, whereas CS-VIBE showed more breathing and pulsation artifacts. For morphologic assessment, intrareader agreement between CS-VIBE and the more time-consuming VIBE-DIXON was slight to almost perfect, and generally higher than interreader agreement. Mean sensitivity (84.0% and 92.0% for CS-VIBE and VIBE-DIXON, P = 0.500) and specificity (60.0% and 55.4% for CS-VIBE and VIBE-DIXON, P = 0.327) were comparable for both sequences. Compressed-sensing volume-interpolated breath-hold examination allows an increase of the through-plane spatial resolution of ultrafast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging compared with TWIST at a comparable in-plane IQ. Morphological assessment of lesions using CS-VIBE is comparable to VIBE-DIXON, which takes 18 times longer. Consequently, CS-VIBE enables 3D evaluation of breast lesions in ultrafast breast MRI.},

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to correlate BPE to patient and tumor characteristics in women with unilateral MRI-screen detected breast cancer who participated in an intermediate and high risk screening program. As BPE in the affected breast may be difficult to discern from enhancing cancer, we assumed that BPE in the contralateral breast is a representative measure for BPE in women with unilateral breast cancer. This retrospective study was approved by our local institutional board and a waiver for consent was granted. MR-examinations of women with unilateral breast cancers screen-detected on breast MRI were evaluated by two readers. BPE in the contralateral breast was rated according to BI-RADS. Univariate analyses were performed to study associations. Observer variability was computed. Analysis included 77 breast cancers in 76 patients (age: 48+-9.8 years), including 62 invasive and 15 pure ductal carcinoma in-situ cases. A negative association between BPE and tumor grade (p<=0.016) and a positive association with progesterone status (p<=0.021) was found. The correlation was stronger when only considering invasive disease. Inter-reader agreement was substantial. Lower BPE in the contralateral breast in women with unilateral breast cancer might be associated to higher tumor grade and progesterone receptor negativity. Great care should be taken using BPE for stratification of patients to tailored screening programs.},

The survival chances are increased by the early detection of breast cancer. To ensure early detection, breast cancer screening was introduced in the Netherlands, in which women from the age of 50 are invited for a biennial mammography. Unfortunately, mammography has its limitations, causing that breast parenchyma can obscure cancer. In addition, research has already proven that high breast density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer. Other significant risk factors are personal history of breast cancer, radiation to the chest at a young age, extensive family history of breast cancer, and a proven BRCA gene mutation.},

Patient files from women who participated in an increased risk mammography and MRI screening program (2003-2014) were coupled to the Dutch National Cancer Registry. For each cancer detected, we determined whether an MRI scan was available (0-24 months before cancer detection), which was reported to be negative. These negative MRI scans were in consensus re-evaluated by two dedicated breast radiologists, with knowledge of the cancer location. Cancers were scored as invisible, minimal sign, or visible. Additionally, BI-RADS scores, background parenchymal enhancement, and image quality (IQ; perfect, sufficient, bad) were determined. Results were stratified by detection mode (mammography, MRI, interval cancers, or cancers in prophylactic mastectomies) and patient characteristics (presence of BRCA mutation, age, menopausal state). Negative prior MRI scans were available for 131 breast cancers. Overall 31% of cancers were visible at the initially negative MRI scan and 34% of cancers showed a minimal sign. The presence of a BRCA mutation strongly reduced the likelihood of visible findings in the last negative MRI (19 vs. 46%, P < 0.001). Less than perfect IQ increased the likelihood of visible findings and minimal signs in the negative MRI (P = 0.021). This study shows that almost one-third of cancers detected in a high-risk screening program are already visible at the last negative MRI scan, and even more in women without BRCA mutations. Regular auditing and double reading for breast MRI screening is warranted.},

  abstract = {Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging method for breast cancer detection and is therefore offered as a screening technique to women at increased risk of developing breast cancer. However, mammography is currently added from the age of 30 without proven benefits. The purpose of this study is to investigate the added cancer detection of mammography when breast MRI is available, focusing on the value in women with and without BRCA mutation, and in the age groups above and below 50 years. This retrospective single-center study evaluated 6553 screening rounds in 2026 women at increased risk of breast cancer (1 January 2003 to 1 January 2014). Risk category (BRCA mutation versus others at increased risk of breast cancer), age at examination, recall, biopsy, and histopathological diagnosis were recorded. Cancer yield, false positive recall rate (FPR), and false positive biopsy rate (FPB) were calculated using generalized estimating equations for separate age categories (< 40, 40-50, 50-60, >= 60 years). Numbers of screens needed to detect an additional breast cancer with mammography (NSN) were calculated for the subgroups. Of a total of 125 screen-detected breast cancers, 112 were detected by MRI and 66 by mammography: 13 cancers were solely detected by mammography, including 8 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ. In BRCA mutation carriers, 3 of 61 cancers were detected only on mammography, while in other women 10 of 64 cases were detected with mammography alone. While 77% of mammography-detected-only cancers were detected in women >= 50 years of age, mammography also added more to the FPR in these women. Below 50 years the number of mammographic examinations needed to find an MRI-occult cancer was 1427. Mammography is of limited added value in terms of cancer detection when breast MRI is available for women of all ages who are at increased risk. While the benefit appears slightly larger in women over 50 years of age without BRCA mutation, there is also a substantial increase in false positive findings in these women.},

Materials and Methods Screening examinations (magnetic resonance [MR] imaging and mammography) for women at increased breast cancer risk (January 1, 2003, to January 1, 2014) were evaluated. Risk category, age, recall for workup of screening-detected abnormalities, biopsy, and histopathologic diagnosis were recorded. Recall rate, biopsy rate, positive predictive value of recall, positive predictive value of biopsy, cancer detection rate, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for first and follow-up rounds. Results There were 8818 MR and 6245 mammographic examinations performed in 2463 women. Documented were 170 cancers; of these, there were 129 screening-detected cancers, 16 interval cancers, and 25 cancers discovered at prophylactic mastectomy. Overall sensitivity was 75.9% including the cancers discovered at prophylactic mastectomy (95% confidence interval: 69.5%, 82.4%) and 90.0% excluding those cancers (95% confidence interval: 83.3%, 93.7%). Sensitivity was lowest for carriers of the BRCA1 mutation (66.1% and 81.3% when including and not including cancers in prophylactic mastectomy specimens, respectively). Specificity was higher at follow-up (96.5%; 95% confidence interval: 96.0%, 96.9%) than in first rounds (85.1%; 95% confidence interval: 83.4%, 86.5%) and was high for both MR imaging (97.1%; 95% confidence interval: 96.7%, 97.5%) and mammography (98.7%; 95% confidence interval: 98.3%, 99.0%). Positive predictive value of recall and positive predictive value of biopsy were lowest in women who had only a family history of breast cancer. Conclusion Screening performance was dependent on risk category. Sensitivity was lowest in carriers of the BRCA1 mutation. The specificity of high-risk breast screening improved at follow-up rounds.   RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

  abstract = {Computer-aided detection aims to improve breast cancer screening programs by helping radiologists to evaluate digital mammography (DM) exams. DM exams are generated by devices from different vendors, with diverse characteristics between and even within vendors. Physical properties of these devices and postprocessing of the images can greatly influence the resulting mammogram. This results in the fact that a deep learning model trained on data from one vendor cannot readily be applied to data from another vendor. This paper investigates the use of tailored transfer learning methods based on adversarial learning to tackle this problem. We consider a database of DM exams (mostly bilateral and two views) generated by Hologic and Siemens vendors. We analyze two transfer learning settings: 1) unsupervised transfer, where Hologic data with soft lesion annotation at pixel level and Siemens unlabelled data are used to annotate images in the latter data; 2) weak supervised transfer, where exam level labels for images from the Siemens mammograph are available. We propose tailored variants of recent state-of-the-art methods for transfer learning which take into account the class imbalance and incorporate knowledge provided by the annotations at exam level. Results of experiments indicate the beneficial effect of transfer learning in both transfer settings. Notably, at 0.02 false positives per image, we achieve a sensitivity of 0.37, compared to 0.30 of a baseline with no transfer. Results indicate that using exam level annotations gives an additional increase in sensitivity.},

  pages = {56},
  abstract = {There is large interest in automated carotid artery plaque analysis, as there is increasing evidence that atherosclerotic plaque volume and composition are related to acute cerebrovascular events. In this study, a novel semi-automatic method was developed to segment the plaque in the common carotid artery. First the carotid lumen is semi-automatically segmented using a level set approach initialized with three seed points [1]. Then calcified regions located within the vessel are automatically detected with the GentleBoost framework using a number of descriptive features. In the next step, voxels are classified as being inside or outside vessel with the GentleBoost framework with a similar set of features [2]. Finally, a 2D ellipse shape deformable model is fitted to the combined result of the calcium and vessel wall classification. The ellipses are fitted in a way that automatically detected calcified regions are positioned inside each ellipse, at the same time the sum of intensities along the ellipse is minimized. The method was trained on 40 CTA datasets, and tested on 60 data sets. For 20 datasets from the test set, second observer manual segmentations were available. The evaluation included comparison between the automated and manual segmentation and a comparison with interobserver variability. Automated segmentation revealed a vessel volume of 897A-A?A 1/2 722mm3, while difference between manual and automated segmentation was 3.1A-A?A 1/2 116 mm3 (p=0.92), the similarity index (SI) was 91% and the coefficient of variation (CoV) is 13%. This was better than the interobserver variability with a difference of -20A-A?A 1/2 118 mm3 (p=0.46), an SI of 92% and a CoV of 15%. Automated segmentation revealed a plaque volume (vessel volumeA-A?A 1/2 lumen volume) of 393A-A?A 1/2 295 mm3, while difference between manual and automated segmentation was -4.7A-A?A 1/2 116 mm3 (p=0.75), the SI was 78% and the CoV is 29%. This was better than the interobserver variability with a difference of -37A-A?A 1/2 121 mm3 (p=0.19), an SI of 80% and a CoV of 33%. We conclude that automated segmentation of the atherosclerotic plaque is robust and accurate when compared to the manual interobserver variability.

In 90 datasets, significant associations were found between age, gender, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, smoking and previous cerebrovascular disease and plaque features. For both automated and manual measurements, significant associations were found between: age and calcium and fibrous tissue percentage; gender and plaque volume and lipid percentage; diabetes and calcium, smoking and plaque volume; previous cerebrovascular disease and plaque volume. Significant associations found only by the automated method were between age and plaque volume, hypercholesterolemia and plaque volume and diabetes and fibrous tissue percentage. Significant association found only by the manual method was between previous cerebrovascular disease and percentage of fibrous tissue. Automated analysis of plaque composition in the carotid arteries is comparable with the manual analysis and has the potential to replace it.},

  abstract = {Cephalometric analysis is the process of placing anatomical landmark points on lateral headplate X-ray scans. Placing these points with precision is crucial as the angle and distancemeasurements required during treatment are calculated using these points. This project aimed to automate the process of cephalometric analysis on lateral headplates X-ray scans. An object detection model followed by a heatmap regression was proposed to find the landmark locations. In total, 1000 images were acquired fromthe Radboud UMC, Department of Dentistry. Experiments with different network architecture, bounding box sizes, anchor optimisation methods, augmentations, and heatmap regression strategies were performed to converge the model resulting in low loss and high average precision and recall score. The best performing model was Cascade RCNN with a pre-trained ResNet101 as the backbone, without the additional heatmap regressor unit. The final network achieved a mean radial error (MRE) of 1.12 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.81 and success detection rate(SDR) of 85.76%. The average precision with intersection over union (IOU) ranging 0.5:0.9 and step size increase of 0.05 was 0.857. The automated cephalometric analysis model will save time, provide objective results, and help the orthodontists and surgeons in initial screening and mid-treatment assessment.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Differences in breast density between populationsmay explain part of the variation in regional breast cancerscreening performance. This study aimed to determine whether regional differences in breast density distribution are present in the Dutch screening population. Methods: As part of the DENSE trial, mammographic density was measured using a fully-automated volumetric method. The regions in our study were based on the geographic coverage of 14 reading units representing a large part of the Netherlands. General linear models were used. Results: Four hundred eighty-five thousand and twenty-one screening participants with a median age of 60 years were included (2013-2014). The proportion of women with hetero-geneously or extremely dense breasts ranged from 32.5 % to 45.7 % between regions. Mean percent dense volume varied between 6.51 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 6.46-6.55)and 7.68 % (95 % CI: 7.66-7.71). Age differences could not explain the variation. Socio-economic status (SES) was positively associated with volumetric density in all analyses (lowSES: 6.95 % vs. high SES: 7.63 %;ptrend<0.0001),whereas a potential association between urbanisation and breast densityonly became apparent after SES adjustment. Conclusion: There appears to be geographic variation in mammographic density in the Netherlands, emphasizing the importance of including breast density as parameter in the evaluation of screening performance.},

  abstract = {Background: Mechanical ventilation (MV) induces an inflammatory response that may result in (acute) lung injury. Lidocaine, an amide local anesthetic, has anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in vivo, possibly due to an attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and reduction of neutrophils influx. We hypothesized an attenuation of MV-induced inflammatory response with intravenously administered lidocaine. Methods: Lidocaine (Lido) (2, 4, and 8 mg/kg/h) was intravenously administered during 4 h of MV with a tidal volume of 8 ml/ kg, positive end expiratory pressure 1,5 cmH2O and FiO2 0.4. We used one ventilated control (CON) group receiving vehicle. After MV, mice were euthanized, and lungs and blood were immediately harvested, and cytokine levels and ICAM-1 levels were measured in plasma and lung homogenates. Pulmonary neutrophils influx was determined in LEDER-stained slices of lungs. Anesthetic need was determined by painful hind paw stimulation. Results: Lidocaine-treated animals (Lido 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg/h) showed higher interleukin (IL)-10 plasma levels compared to control animals. Lidocaine treatment with 8 mg/kg/h (Lido 8) resulted in higher IL-10 in lung homogenates. No differences were observed in pro-inflammatory cytokines, ICAM-1, and pulmonary influx between the different ventilated groups. Conclusions: Intravenously administered lidocaine increases levels of plasma IL-10 with infusion from 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg/h and pulmonary levels of IL-10 with 8 mg/kg/h in a murine mechanical ventilation model. Intravenously administered lidocaine appears to reduce anesthetic need in mice.},

                             Methods and Materials: We collected a consecutive series of 69,874 FFDM examinations (2003-2009) from one screening unit of the Dutch biennial screening program (50-75 years). Volumetric mammographic density was automatically assessed with Volpara version 1.5.0 (Matakina, New Zealand). Recall and breast cancer detection information was obtained from the screening registration system. Interval cancers were identified through linkage with the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Within four density categories, comparable to ACR breast density categories, we determined screening performance measures and linear trends with a Chi Square linear trend test.
                             Results: 19.7% of the examinations was categorised as density category 1 ('almost entirely fatty'), 43.1% as category 2, 29.4% as category 3 and 7.7% as category 4 ('extremely dense'). In total 421 screen-detected and 150 interval tumours were identified. Cancer detection rates were 3.7?, 6.4?, 6.6? and 6.3? in categories 1 to 4 respectively (p=0.005). Interval cancer rates increased with increasing density categories: 0.7?, 1.9?, 3.0? and 4.5?, respectively (p< 0.001). As a result, the sensitivity (proportion of screen-detected tumours of screen-detected and interval tumours) was lower in higher density categories: 85.0%, 77.6%, 69.0% and 58.6% respectively (p< 0.001). The number of false positives was higher in women with dense breasts: 11.4?, 14.1?, 18.3? and 28.6? for categories 1 to 4, respectively (p< 0.001).
                             Conclusion: Also when FFDM is used in breast cancer screening higher interval cancer and false-positive rates are observed in women with mammographically dense breasts.},

  abstract = {Purpose: In light of breast density legislation and discussions about supplemental screening it is important to know not only one's risk of breast cancer, but particularly the risk of a tumor that is not detected through mammographic screening. We investigated the relationship between volumetric breast density and the risk of screen-detected and interval cancer within a digital mammography (DM) screening program.
                             Methods: Mammographic density was automatically assessed with Volpara version 1.5.0 (Matakina, New Zealand) on the first available digital mammogram of 43,211 women (50-75 years) participating in the Dutch biennial breast cancer screening program (2003-2009). Screen-detected and interval breast cancer information was obtained from the screening registration system and through linkage with the Netherlands Cancer Registry. We estimated risks of screen-detected and interval cancers in relation to breast density using multinomial logistic regression analysis (adjusted for age). No other confounders were available in this routine screening database.
                             Results: 413 screen-detected and 150 interval tumors were identified. Screen-detected breast cancer risk was significantly higher in the higher breast density categories compared to the lowest (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.21-2.24, OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.29-2.47, OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.08-2.63, for density categories 2 to 4 respectively compared to 1). Interval cancer risk increased with increasing breast density (OR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.20-4.99, OR: 5.24, 95% CI: 2.59-10.59 and OR: 6.86, 95% CI: 3.12-15.11, for density categories 2 to 4 respectively compared to 1). The relationship with interval cancers was statistically significantly stronger than with screen-detected cancers (p<0.01) for density categories 3 and 4.
                             Conclusions: Although higher breast density is related to a higher risk of a screen-detected breast cancer, it is particularly strongly related to the risk of a breast cancer that is not detected through mammographic screening (interval cancer).},

  abstract = {To determine to what extent automatically measured volumetric mammographic density influences screening performance when using digital mammography (DM). We collected a consecutive series of 111,898 DM examinations (2003-2011) from one screening unit of the Dutch biennial screening program (age 50-75 years). Volumetric mammographic density was automatically assessed using Volpara. We determined screening performance measures for four density categories comparable to the American College of Radiology (ACR) breast density categories. Of all the examinations, 21.6% were categorized as density category 1 ('almost entirely fatty') and 41.5, 28.9, and 8.0% as category 2-4 ('extremely dense'), respectively. We identified 667 screen-detected and 234 interval cancers. Interval cancer rates were 0.7, 1.9, 2.9, and 4.4 \textperthousand and false positive rates were 11.2, 15.1, 18.2, and 23.8 \textperthousand for categories 1-4, respectively (both p-trend < 0.001). The screening sensitivity, calculated as the proportion of screen-detected among the total of screen-detected and interval tumors, was lower in higher density categories: 85.7, 77.6, 69.5, and 61.0% for categories 1-4, respectively (p-trend < 0.001). Volumetric mammographic density, automatically measured on digital mammograms, impacts screening performance measures along the same patterns as established with ACR breast density categories. Since measuring breast density fully automatically has much higher reproducibility than visual assessment, this automatic method could help with implementing density-based supplemental screening.},

  abstract = {Background In the light of the breast density legislation in the USA, it is important to know a woman's breast cancer risk, but particularly her risk of a tumor that is not detected through mammographic screening (interval cancer). Therefore, we examined the associations of automatically measured volumetric breast density with screen-detected and interval cancer risk, separately.
                             Methods Volumetric breast measures were assessed automatically using Volpara version 1.5.0 (Matakina, New Zealand) for the first available digital mammography (DM) examination of 52,814 women (age 50-75 years) participating in the Dutch biennial breast cancer screening program between 2003 and 2011. Breast cancer information was obtained from the screening registration system and through linkage with the Netherlands Cancer Registry. We excluded all screen-detected breast cancers diagnosed as a result of the first digital screening examination. During a median follow-up period of 4.2 (IQR 2.0-6.2) years, 523 women were diagnosed with breast cancer of which 299 were screen-detected and 224 were interval breast cancers. The associations between volumetric breast measures and breast cancer risk were determined using Cox proportional hazards analyses.
                             Results Percentage dense volume was found to be positively associated with both interval and screen-detected breast cancers (hazard ratio (HR) 8.37 (95% CI 4.34-16.17) and HR 1.39 (95% CI 0.82-2.36), respectively, for Volpara density grade category (VDG) 4 compared to VDG1 (p for heterogeneity < 0.001)). Dense volume (DV) was also found to be positively associated with both interval and screen-detected breast cancers (HR 4.92 (95% CI 2.98-8.12) and HR 2.30 (95% CI 1.39-3.80), respectively, for VDG-like category (C)4 compared to C1 (p for heterogeneity = 0.041)). The association between percentage dense volume categories and interval breast cancer risk (HR 8.37) was not significantly stronger than the association between absolute dense volume categories and interval breast cancer risk (HR 4.92).
                             Conclusions Our results suggest that both absolute dense volume and percentage dense volume are strong markers of breast cancer risk, but that they are even stronger markers for predicting the occurrence of tumors that are not detected during mammography breast cancer screening.},

  abstract = {In breast cancer screening for high-risk women, follow-up magnetic resonance images (MRI) are acquired with a time interval ranging from several months up to a few years. Prior MRI studies may provide additional clinical value when examining the current one and thus have the potential to increase sensitivity and specificity of screening. To build a spatial correlation between suspicious findings in both current and prior studies, a reliable alignment method between follow-up studies is desirable. However, long time interval, different scanners and imaging protocols, and varying breast compression can result in a large deformation, which challenges the registration process. In this work, we present a fast and robust spatial alignment framework, which combines automated breast segmentation and current-prior registration techniques in a multi-level fashion. First, fully automatic breast segmentation is applied to extract the breast masks that are used to obtain an initial affine transform. Then, a non-rigid registration algorithm using normalized gradient fields as similarity measure together with curvature regularization is applied. A total of 29 subjects and 58 breast MR images were collected for performance assessment. To evaluate the global registration accuracy, the volume overlap and boundary surface distance metrics are calculated, resulting in an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.96 and root mean square distance (RMSD) of 1.64 mm. In addition, to measure local registration accuracy, for each subject a radiologist annotated 10 pairs of markers in the current and prior studies representing corresponding anatomical locations. The average distance error of marker pairs dropped from 67.37 mm to 10.86 mm after applying registration.},

  title = {Automatic Spatial Linking of Lesions in Breast MRI Follow-up Images},
  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {PURPOSE Automatically linking the lesions detected in breast MRI follow-up examinations is required for the development of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to quantify characteristic changes of the lesions. In this work, we develop a registration-based method that enables automatic linking of lesions detected in breast MRI follow-up studies. METHOD AND MATERIALS From 51 subjects participating in a MRI screening program, we collected 102 dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) images, forming 51 pairs of follow-up studies. Current and prior examinations were acquired in different scanners with a time interval of one year, using transversal and coronal views, respectively. One experienced radiologist manually placed 71 pairs of markers, indicating the center locations of 71 pairs of lesions found in both current and prior studies. Automatic lesion linking is achieved by registering current and prior MRI examinations. First, a motion correction algorithm is performed on both current and prior DCE-MRI. Then, fully automatic breast segmentation is applied on the current and prior pre-contrast images to extract breast masks, which are used to obtain an initial affine transform. Then, a non-rigid registration algorithm using normalized gradient fields as similarity measure together with curvature regularization is exploited to register the current and prior pre-contrast images. Since the follow-up scans may have inconsistent field of views, the registration only focuses on the segmented breast regions to enforce the alignment accuracy in breast areas, such that non-breast regions will not attract and influence the registration process. RESULTS Based on the deformation fields obtained by registration, markers labeling the lesions in the current image were transformed to the prior image frame, where the distance between the transformed markers and the markers originally labeled in prior images was computed. The average distance error was 9.6 A,A+- 9.3 mm. CONCLUSION The proposed system is potentially applicable to automatically link the lesions detected in a CAD system to investigate the characteristic changes. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Visual assessment and comparison of characteristic change of the lesions in breast DCE-MRI follow-up exams is time consuming, and computer-aided lesion comparison may increase clinical effectiveness.},

  title = {Automated airway lumen segmentation and characterization for use in patients with tracheomalacya: a feasibility study},
  booktitle = ISMRM,
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Introduction: Tracheomalacia (TM) refers to a weakness of the trachea, frequently due to reduction and/or atrophy of the longitudinal elastic fibers of the pars membranacea, or impaired cartilage integrity, such that the airway is softer and more susceptible to collapse. Various degrees of tracheal collapse, and therefore airway obstruction, can result from this narrowing. Diagnosis of TM includes history and physical examination, e.g. expiratory manoeuvre and cough. Pulmonary function tests include the determination of flow limitations during expiration. However, endoscopy is the essential and invaluable tool and remains the gold standard method for evaluating the airways. From the imaging perspective, conventional radiographs have had a lower sensitivity (62%), and are used in conjunction with endoscopy. A CT-scan is the initial radiologic test in cases of suspect TM. MRI is another imaging possibility for evaluating central airway abnormalities, however, not often used because of severe drawbacks in an area with large magnetic susceptibility gradients, poor signal homogeneity and prone to low spatial resolution and motion artifacts. The majority of papers diagnosis of TM considers imaging during end-inspiration and end-expiration. Nonetheless, more recently, some authors have demonstrated the importance of dynamic CINE acquisitions, indicating that dynamic-MRI studies during coughing may facilitate the evaluation of the collapsibility of the trachea in patients with TM. Purpose:The purpose of this work was to provide: first, a suitable acquisition scenario including static and dynamic 3D MRI sequences with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to provide good morphological information and visualization of dynamic events in the central airways and, secondly, to provide the means for an automatic analysis program suitable to segment the airway lumen and a dynamic evaluation of cross-sectional areas of the central airways down to the 2nd generation branching. Materials and Methods: 10 healthy adult volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age were recruited as pilot group to optimize image acquisition for the static and dynamic portions of the MRI examination at 1.5T. Volunteers were trained to perform spirometry controlled breathing manoeuvres using a MRI compatible spirometer. Each subject was instructed additionally to perform forced expiration and cough maneuvers. A-A?A 1/2 Static?? 13-second breath-hold scans covering the entire thoracic region were acquired at end-inspiration and endexpiration using a 3D rf-spoiled gradient echo sequence with TR/TE=1.2/0.5 ms, flip angle 2A-A?A 1/2 , sagittal volume acquisition with isotropic (2.8) 3 mm3 voxels. A-A?A 1/2 Dynamic?? scans were performed with the same scan parameters but covering only the central thorax (1/3 volume) with a temporal resolution of 500 ms per volume using the TRICKS (time resolved imaging of contrast kinetics) platform and accelerated imaging options. In-house developed software for segmentation and analysis was used. To initiate the timedomain analysis 3 seeds were placed corresponding to the beginning of the trachea and ends of the left and right primary bronchi to produce a centerline. The lumen is then segmented and a surface created to produce a unique reference frame to ease the timeanalysis (Figure 1). A cross-sectional analysis can then be performed to determine stenosis and distensibility parameters. Likewise, longitudinal and geometrical analyses (e.g., bifurcation angles and planarity) are generated. Results and Discussion: The software tracks the level of the branching automatically and provides a uniquely defined origin per data set thus enabling time comparisons in the same individual and across healthy and patients with TM. The analysis is completely automated (except for three seed points for lumen), providing as output any lumen based parameters that are desired and/or are clinical relevant. With optimized parameter settings the method successfully tracked the central airway paths in all volunteers. Conclusions: The results show that
                             robust and accurate segmentation of the airways is feasible with the acquired MRI datasets. This work is highly relevant for clinical research and practice: automated lumen segmentation in patients with TM (or other related disease of the airways) is the first step for automatic grading of airway malignancy.},

  abstract = {Adhesions are an important cause of chronic pain following abdominal surgery. Recent developments in abdominal cine-MRI have enabled the non-invasive diagnosis of adhesions. Adhesions are identified on cine-MRI by the absence of sliding motion during movement. Diagnosis and mapping of adhesions improves the management of patients with pain. Detection of abdominal adhesions on cine-MRI is challenging from both a radiological and deep learning perspective. We focus on classifying presence or absence of adhesions in sagittal abdominal cine-MRI series. We experimented with spatio-temporal deep learning architectures centered around a ConvGRU architecture. A hybrid architecture comprising a ResNet followed by a ConvGRU model allows to classify a whole time-series. Compared to a stand-alone ResNet with a two time-point (inspiration/expiration) input, we show an increase in classification performance (AUROC) from 0.74 to 0.83 (p<0.05). Our full temporal classification approach adds only a small amount (5%) of parameters to the entire architecture, which may be useful for other medical imaging problems with a temporal dimension.},

Parsimonious and full PanCan risk prediction models were applied to DLCST data, and also coefficients of the model were recalculated using DLCST data. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate risk discrimination.AUCs of 0.826-0.870 were found for DLCST data based on PanCan risk prediction models.

  abstract = {Distribution shift is a common phenomenon in real-life safety-critical situations that is detrimental to the performance of current deep learning models. Constructing a principled method to detect such a shift is critical to building safe and predictable automated image analysis pipelines for medical imaging. In this work, we interpret the problem of out-of-distribution detection for computational pathology in an epistemic uncertainty estimation setting. Given the difficulty of obtaining a sufficiently multi-modal predictive distribution for uncertainty estimation, we present a multiple heads topology in CNNs as a highly diverse ensembling method. We empirically prove that the method exhibits greater representational diversity than various popular ensembling methods, such as MC dropout and Deep Ensembles. The fast gradient sign method is repurposed and we show that it separates the softmax scores of in-distribution samples and out-of-distribution samples. We identify the challenges for this task in the domain of computational pathology and extensively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two clinically relevant tasks in this ?eld.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved retrospective study, six observers with varying experience evaluated 158 PE-negative and 51 PE-positive CT pulmonary angiographic studies (mean age, 57 years; 111 women, 98 men) obtained consecutively during nights and weekends. Observers were asked to determine the presence of PE and to rank their diagnostic confidence without CAD and subsequently with CAD within a single reading session. Reading time was separately measured for both readings. Reader data were compared with an independent standard established by two readers, with a third in case of discordant results. Statistical evaluation was performed on a per-patient basis by using logistic regression for repeated measurements and Pearson correlation. RESULTS: With CAD, there was a significant increase in readers' sensitivity (P = .014) without loss of specificity (P = .853) on a per-patient basis. CAD assisted the readers in correcting an initial false-negative diagnosis in 15 cases, with the most proximal embolus at the segmental level in four cases and at the subsegmental level in 11 cases. In eight cases, readers accepted false-positive CAD candidate lesions on scans negative for PE, and in one case, a reader dismissed a true-positive finding. Reading time was extended by a mean of 22 seconds with the use of CAD. CONCLUSION: At the expense of increased reading time, CAD has the potential to increase reader sensitivity for detecting segmental and subsegmental PE without significant loss of specificity.

  abstract = {Compare the right ventricle to left ventricle (RV/LV) diameter ratio obtained from axial pulmonary CT angiograms (CTPA) with those derived from automatically generated 4-chamber (4-CH) reformats in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).In this institutional review board-approved study we included 120 consecutive non ECG-gated CTPA from 3 institutions (mean age 60A-A?A 1/2 16 years; 71 women). Twenty 64-slice CTPA with PE and 20 without PE were selected per institution. For each patient the RV/LV diameter ratio was obtained from both axial CTPA images and automatically generated 4-CH reformats. Measurements were performed twice in two separated sessions by 2 experienced radiologists and 2 residents. The differences between the measurements on both views were evaluated.The 4-CH view was successfully obtained in 113 patients. The mean axial and 4-CH diameter ratios were comparable for three of the four readers (p=0.56, p=0.13, p=0.08). Although the mean diameters (1.0 and 1.03 respectively) for one resident were significantly different (p=0.013), the difference of 0.03 seems negligible in clinical routine. Three readers achieved equally high intra-reader agreements with both measurements (ICCs of 0.94, 0.95 and 0.96), while one reader showed a different variability with ICCs of 0.96 for the axial view and 0.91 for the 4-CH view. The inter-reader agreement was equally high for both measurement types with ICCs of 0.95 and 0.94, respectively.In patients with suspected PE, RV/LV diameters ratio can be measured with the same reproducibility and accuracy using an automatically generated 4-CH view compared to the axial view.},

  abstract = {Objective: To assess whether the performance of a computer-assisted detection (CAD) algorithm for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) differs in pulmonary CT angiographies acquired at various institutions. Methods: In this retrospective study, we included 40 consecutive scans with and 40 without PE from 3 institutions (n=240) using 64-slice scanners made by different manufacturers (General Electric; Philips; Siemens). CAD markers were classified as true or false positive (FP) using independent evaluation by two readers and consultation of a third chest radiologist in discordant cases. Image quality parameters were subjectively scored using 4/5-point scales. Image noise and vascular enhancement were measured. Statistical analysis was done to correlate image quality of the three institutions with CAD stand-alone performance. Results: Patient groups were comparable with respect to age (p=0.22), accompanying lung disease (p=0.12) and inpatient/outpatient ratio (p=0.67). The sensitivity was 100\% (34/34), 97\% (37/38) and 92\% (33/36), and the specificity was 18\% (8/44), 15\% (6/41) and 13\% (5/39). Neither significantly differed between the institutions (p=0.21 and p=0.820, respectively). The mean number of FP findings (4.5, 6.2 and 3.7) significantly varied (p=0.02 and p=0.03), but median numbers (2, 3 and 3) were comparable. Image quality parameters were significantly associated with the number of FP findings (p<0.05) but not with sensitivity. After correcting for noise and vascular enhancement, the number of FPs did not significantly differ between the three institutions (p=0.43). Conclusions: CAD stand-alone performance is independent of scanner type but strongly related to image quality and thus scanning protocols.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and often potentially life threatening disease. Severe morbidity and mortality can be prevented if PE is diagnosed and treated in time. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has emerged as an effective method for diagnosis of PE, but interpreting a CTPA is complicated by the size of the image date set, the various PE look-alikes and also human factors such as experience and attention span. In this thesis, we therefore evaluated the performance of a computer-assisted detection (CAD) prototype for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) to help radiologists detect PE. The first part of this thesis summarises the latest technical development of CT scanners, the new challenges for protocol design associated with these new techniques and the options offered by new processing and evaluation tools. In the second part the standalone performance of a CAD prototype is described in 278 CTPA scans that had been consecutively obtained during night and weekend shifts. The CAD performance was compared with a reference standard obtained by consensus of three readers and with the reports made after acquisition of the clinical scans. The results suggested that CAD can help to find subtle isolated segmental and subsegmental emboli and to exclude PE. Furthermore, we found that image quality parameters and thus scanning protocosl effect the standalone performance more than scanner type, using 240 CTPA scans in 3 different hospitals. In the third part of this thesis we tested if CAD has indeed an impact on the performance of readers. Per study set up we used 6 readers with varying radiological experience to analyse the effect of CAD when CAD was used as a second or as a concurrent reader. Using CAD as a second reader in 209 CTPA scans, we showed an increase in readers' confidence and sensitivity without loss of specificity. Similarly as seen in the second part, we found the greatest impact of CAD on the detection of small segmental and subsegmental emboli. However, these results came with an increase of reading time, which is undesirable in clinical practice. When we tested CAD as a concurrent reader in 196 CTPA scans, we found that readers' sensitivity improved or remained at the same level and readers' confidence increased compared to the readings without CAD, but with a significant shorter reading time. In summary, CAD has the potential to aid readers to find patients with isolated segmental and/or subsegmental emboli, to reassure readers in excluding PE and to decrease reading time. However, before making CAD available for broader application in clinical practice, its impact on readers' decisions and patient outcome needs to be studied in a larger prospective trial.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary lobe segmentation in computed tomography scans is essential for regional assessment of pulmonary diseases. Recent works based on convolution neural networks have achieved good performance for this task. However, they are still limited in capturing structured relationships due to the nature of convolution. The shape of the pulmonary lobes affect each other and their borders relate to the appearance of other structures, such as vessels, airways, and the pleural wall. We argue that such structural relationships play a critical role in the accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes when the lungs are affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD. In this paper, we propose a relational approach (RTSU-Net) that leverages structured relationships by introducing a novel non-local neural network module. The proposed module learns both visual and geometric relationships among all convolution features to produce self-attention weights. With a limited amount of training data available from COVID- 19 subjects, we initially train and validate RTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for evaluation). Using models pre-trained on COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to retrain and evaluate RTSU-Net on 470 COVID-19 suspects (370 for retraining and 100 for evaluation). Experimental results show that RTSU-Net outperforms three baselines and performs robustly on cases with severe lung infection due to COVID-19.},

  journal = {arXiv:2105.11748},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {Automatic lesion segmentation on thoracic CT enables rapid quantitative analysis of lung involvement in COVID-19 infections. However, obtaining a large amount of voxel-level annotations for training segmentation networks is prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we propose a weakly-supervised segmentation method based on dense regression activation maps (dRAMs). Most weakly-supervised segmentation approaches exploit class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However, because CAMs were trained for classification, they do not align precisely with the object segmentations. Instead, we produce high-resolution activation maps using dense features from a segmentation network that was trained to estimate a per-lobe lesion percentage. In this way, the network can exploit knowledge regarding the required lesion volume. In addition, we propose an attention neural network module to refine dRAMs, optimized together with the main regression task. We evaluated our algorithm on 90 subjects. Results show our method achieved 70.2\% Dice coefficient, substantially outperforming the CAM-based baseline at 48.6\%.},

All patients underwent a diagnostic 3T MR examination of the prostate. T2-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR images (DCE-MRI) were acquired. Two radiologists evaluated the MR images in consensus for tumor suspicious regions (TSRs) for local recurrence. Subsequently, these TSRs were biopsied under MR-guidance and histopathologically evaluated for the presence of recurrent PCa. Descriptive statistical analysis was applied.Tissue sampling was successful in all patients and all TSRs. The positive predictive value on a per patient basis was 75\% (15/20) and on a per TSR basis 68\% (26/38). The median number of biopsies taken per patient was 3, and the duration of an MRGB session was 31 minutes. No intervention-related complications occurred.The combination of MRGB and diagnostic MR imaging of the prostate was a feasible technique to localize PCa recurrence after EBRT using a low number of cores in a clinically acceptable time.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Between October 2004 and January 2006, 18 patients with histologically proven PCa on biopsy and scheduled for radical prostatectomy were included and underwent 3D-MRSI with and without an ERC. The prostate was divided into 14 regions of interest (ROIs). Four readers independently rated (on a 5-point scale) their confidence that cancer was present in each of these ROIs. These findings were correlated with whole-mount prostatectomy specimens. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were determined. A difference with a P < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 504 ROIs were rated for the presence and absence of PCa. Localization of PCa with MRSI with the use of an ERC had a significantly higher areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (0.68) than MRSI without the use of an ERC (0.63) (P = 0.015). CONCLUSION: The use of an ERC in 3D MRSI in localizing PCa at 3 Tesla slightly but significantly increased the localization performance compared with not using an ERC.},

In this study, previous screening history of the Dutch-Belgian Lung Cancer Screening trial (NELSON) is investigated on if it predicts the screening outcome (test result and lung cancer risk) of the final screening round. 15 792 participants were randomised (1:1) of which 7900 randomised into a screening group. CT screening took place at baseline, and after 1, 2 and 2.5 years. Initially, three screening outcomes were possible: negative, indeterminate or positive scan result. Probability for screening outcome in the fourth round was calculated for subgroups of participants. Based on results of the first three rounds, three subgroups were identified: (1) those with exclusively negative results (n=3856; 73.0%); (2) those with >=1 indeterminate result, but never a positive result (n=1342; 25.5%); and (3) with >=1 positive result (n=81; 1.5%). Group 1 had the highest probability for having a negative scan result in round 4 (97.2% vs 94.8% and 90.1%, respectively, p<0.001), and the lowest risk for detecting lung cancer in round 4 (0.6% vs 1.6%, p=0.001). 'Smoked pack-years' and 'screening history' significantly predicted the fourth round test result. The third round results implied that the risk for detecting lung cancer (after an interval of 2.5 years) was 0.6% for those with negative results compared with 3.7% of those with indeterminate results. Previous CT lung cancer screening results provides an opportunity for further risk stratifications of those who undergo lung cancer screening. Results, ISRCTN63545820.},

  abstract = {Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent and one of the leading causes of cancer death among men. Multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) is a prominent diagnostic scan, which could help in avoiding unnecessary biopsies for men screened for PCa. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems could help radiologists to be more accurate and consistent in diagnosing clinically significant cancer from mp-MRI scans. Lack of specificity has been identified recently as one of weak points of such assistance systems. In this paper, we propose a novel false positive reduction network to be added to the overall detection system to further analyze lesion candidates. The new network utilizes multiscale 2D image stacks of these candidates to discriminate between true and false positive detections. We trained and validated our network on a dataset with 2170 cases from seven different institutions and tested it on a separate independent dataset with 243 cases. With the proposed model, we achieved area under curve (AUC) of 0.876 on discriminating between true and false positive detected lesions and improved the AUC from 0.825 to 0.867 on overall identification of clinically significant cases.},

  title = {Symptomatic screening and computer-aided radiography for active-case finding of tuberculosis: a prediction model for {TB} case detection},
  booktitle = {45th World Conference on Lung Health},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {Background: Scale-up of rapid tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics through GeneXpert MTB/Rif has supported active-case finding for TB in high burden countries and is being utilized to increase case-notification as part of the TB Reach initiative. However, the high cost per test necessitates investigation of screening approaches that can better rationalize the use of GeneXpert. The aim of this study was to investigate predictive accuracy and validation of a prediction model based on symptomatic screening and computer-aided detection (CAD) radiography compared with GeneXpert MTB/Rif for TB case detection in a high TB burden setting. Methods: Screening for TB was carried out at private Family Practitioner clinics in three low-income towns of Karachi, Pakistan. Suspects for TB were identified on the basis of the presence of cough, fever, hemoptysis, weight loss and night-sweats and were referred for chest X-ray (CXR). All CXRs were analyzed by CAD4TB v3.07 (Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Nijmegen, The Netherlands), a CAD system developed for TB diagnosis. This system computes an abnormality score (0-100) by analyzing the shape, symmetry and texture of the lung fields. GeneXpert testing was carried out on all cases where good quality sputum samples could be obtained. Results: 324 consecutive cases referred for CXR and with sputum samples were recruited into the study. Prediction models were constructed using logistic regressions with TB detection as a binary outcome variable and sequentially adding CAD4TB scores, demographics and symp-tomatic screening as explanatory variables. The final prediction model was constructed using backwards stepwise Akaike's Information Criteria multiple logistic regression and included CAD4TB scores (OR 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04 - 1.12), cough >2 weeks (OR 3.10, 95% CI: 1.09 AC/a,!aEUR? 5.51), age (OR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95 AC/a,!aEUR? 0.98) and gender (OR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.73 AC/a,!aEUR? 1.38). The area under receiver operator curve (AUC) for the model was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.83 AC/a,!aEUR? 0.91). The AUC of a split-set cross validation model for assessing internal validation was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78 AC/a,!aEUR?0.89). The model was appropriately calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow X' 8.99, p-value 0.45). Conclusion: Combining CAD4TB scores with patient demographics and symptomatic screening data offers high predictive accuracy for TB. Multi-center studies are required for external validation of the model in order to provide appropriate evidence for its use in screening in high TB burden settings.},

This study analyzed retrospective data from CAD4TB and Xpert MTB/RIF testing carried out at two private TB treatment and diagnostic centers in Karachi. Sensitivity, specificity, potential Xperts saved, were computed and the receiver operator characteristic curves were constructed for four different models of CAD4TB. A total of 6,845 individuals with presumptive TB were enrolled in the study, 15.2% of which had MTB + ve result on Xpert. A high sensitivity (range 65.8-97.3%) and NPV (range 93.1-98.4%) were recorded for CAD4TB. The Area under the ROC curve (AUC) for CAD4TB was 0.79. CAD4TB with patient demographics (age and gender) gave an AUC of 0.83. CAD4TB offered high diagnostic accuracy. In low resource settings, CAD4TB, as a triage tool could minimize use of Xpert. Using CAD4TB in combination with age and gender data enhanced the performance of the software. Variations in demographic information generate different individual risk probabilities for the same CAD4TB scores.},

  title = {{EyeNED} workstation: Development of a multi-modal vendor-independent application for annotation, spatial alignment and analysis of retinal images},
  abstract = {Purpose:
                             Researchers and specialists in the field of ophthalmology currently rely on suboptimal vendor-specific software solutions for viewing and annotating retinal images. Our goal was to develop a fully-featured vendor-independent application that allows researchers and specialists to visualize multi-modal retinal images, perform spatial alignment and annotations, and review outputs of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.

                             Methods:
                             The application consists of a web-based front-end that allows users to analyze baseline and follow-up images in a multi-modal viewer. It communicates with a back-end interface for grader authentication, loading and storing of images and annotation data. Several types of annotation techniques are available, ranging from image-level classification to point-based and region-based lesion-level annotations.

                             The user can select color fundus (CF) images, optical coherence tomography (OCT) volumes, infrared (IR) and autofluorescence (AF) images to be shown simultaneously in the viewer. Spatial alignment of the different modalities can be performed using an integrated affine registration method by clicking on corresponding landmarks, after which a synchronized cursor will appear. After several graders have annotated lesions, the application can be used to compare these and create a consensus grading.

                             Results :
                             The application was used by graders and researchers in the EyeNED research group. Region based annotations of geographic atrophy were made for 313 studies containing 488 CF images and 68 OCT images; and of drusen in 100 OCT b-scans. Semi-automatic annotation of the area of central retinal atrophy in Stargardt disease was performed for 67 AF images. Point-based annotation was carried out on lesions in 50 CF images of diabetic retinopathy patients. The multimodal viewing and localisation of lesions was perceived as particularly helpful in the grading of lesions and consensus discussions.

                             Conclusions :
                             A software solution has been developed to assist researchers and specialists to view and annotate retinal images. The application was successfully used for annotating lesions in various imaging modalities, facilitating the grading of images in large studies and the collection of annotations for AI solutions.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Automated 3D-breast ultrasound (ABVS) is investigated as a six-monthly addition to annual breast cancer screening with MRI+mammography (MM) in highrisk women (LTR> 50%). ABVS, an inexpensive radiation-free technique, allows more frequent screening and temporal comparison. This study assesses effects of additional ABVS examinations at baseline. Methods and Materials: The study population consists of 234 women in whom ABVS and MM were performed on the same day. All ABVS and MM examinations were read by one of 4 breast radiologist. The recall rate (RR), biopsy rate (BR), cancer detection rate (CDR), sensitivity and specificity of ABVS and MM screening were analysed. Results: Based upon MM, 28 patients were recalled for further examination (RR=12%). With ABVS 12 of these patients were also recalled, as well as 17 other women. Consequently, the RR increased to 45/234. Biopsies were deemed necessary in 21 patients after MM and increased to 26 with ABVS added, an increase from 9%-11%. 17 additional ABVS findings were resolved with targeted ultrasound. In total 4 cancers were found by MM (CDR 1.7%, sensitivity 100%, specificity 89%). Two of these cancers were also detected by ABVS (CDR 0.9%, sensitivity 50% specificity 88%). The two missed cancers were retrospectivelyvisible, but misinterpreted due to post-operative scarring. Conclusion: Adding ABVS to high-risk MM screening increased RR and BR at baseline. Whether these negative effects are reduced when radiologists gain more experience and whether they are balanced by earlier detection of breast cancer due to the six-month interval of ABVS remain to be determined.},

  booktitle = RSNA,
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {PURPOSE To investigate the value of coronal reconstructions of transversal 3D ABUS data in differentiation of benign from malignant breast lesions. METHOD AND MATERIALS This study received a waiver by the local ethics committee. For this reader study we obtained 96 3D ABUS casus with 37 malignant and 59 benign ultrasound guided core biopsied breast lesions. The localization of the lesions was done by a physician with 1 year 3D ABUS experience based on the primary radiology reports and biopsy results. The 3D ABUS view in which the lesion was best visible, was presented to 3 experienced breast radiologists with 2 years experience with 3D ABUS. They were first asked to detect and classify the most suspicious lesion in the view using the BIRADS lexicon and scoring system. A likelihood of malignancy (LOM) score between 0 and 100 was also requested. Thereafter the coronal reconstruction was shown and readers were asked to reassess the lesion. Spiculation and retraction in the coronal plane were scored on a five point scale (Spiculation and Retraction Severity Index (SRSI)). Subsequently LOM and BI-RADS scores could be adjusted. Az values for differentiation of benign from malignant lesions based on LOM scores were computed with DBM MRMC method. PearsonAC/a,!a,,C/s correlation coefficient between the reassessed LOM on the coronal reconstructions and SRSI was calculated for all readers. RESULTS Three readers respectively pointed out 92%, 97% and 92% of 37 cancers as the most suspicious lesion in the 3D ABUS acquisition. After evaluation of the coronal reconstructions, detected malignant lesions were not downgraded to BI-RADS 2, however, 7 benign lesions were downgraded from BI-RADS 3 to BI-RADS 2. After reevaluation the discrimination between benign and malignant lesions significantly improved from 0.84 (95% CI 0.76- 0.92) to 0.87(95% CI 0.80-0.94) (p=0.02). SRSI scores correlated significantly with the reassessed LOM scores for all readers, r = 0.85, 0.75 and 0.75, respectively (p<0.001). CONCLUSION Coronal reconstructions in 3D ABUS significantly improve the differentiation between benign and malignant breast lesions, by providing new visual information on breast cancer spiculation and retraction. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Better differentiation between malignant and benign breast lesions may reduce false positive biopsies in evaluation of automated breast ultrasound},

  abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES:
                             To investigate the value of multiplanar reconstructions (MPRs) of automated three-dimensional (3D) breast ultrasound (ABUS) compared to transverse evaluation only, in differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions.

                             MATERIALS AND METHODS:
                             Five breast radiologists evaluated ABUS scans of 96 female patients with biopsy-proven abnormalities (36 malignant and 60 benign). They classified the most suspicious lesion based on the breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) lexicon using the transverse scans only. A likelihood-of-malignancy (LOM) score (0-100) and a BI-RADS final assessment were assigned. Thereafter, the MPR was provided and readers scored the cases again. In addition, they rated the presence of spiculation and retraction in the coronal plane on a five-point scale called Spiculation and Retraction Severity Index (SRSI). Reader performance was analyzed with receiver-operating characteristics analysis.

                             RESULTS:
                             The area under the curve increased from 0.82 to 0.87 (P = .01) after readers were shown the reconstructed planes. The SRSI scores are highly correlated (Spearman's r) with the final LOM scores (range, r = 0.808-0.872) and DLOM scores (range, r = 0.525-0.836). Readers downgraded 3%-18% of the biopsied benign lesions to BI-RADS 2 after MPR evaluation. Inter-reader agreement for SRSI was substantial (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.617). Inter-reader agreement of the BI-RADS final assessment improved from 0.367 to 0.536 after MPRs were read.

                             CONCLUSIONS:
                             Full 3D evaluation of ABUS using MPR improves differentiation of breast lesions in comparison to evaluating only transverse planes. Results suggest that the added value of MPR might be related to visualization of spiculation and retraction patterns in the coronal reconstructions.},

  abstract = {Our aim was to investigate whether Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System-Ultrasound (BI-RADS-US) lexicon descriptors can be used as imaging biomarkers to differentiate molecular subtypes (MS) of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in automated breast ultrasound (ABUS). We included 125 IDCs diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 and imaged with ABUS at two institutes retrospectively. IDCs were classified as luminal A or B, HER2 enriched or triple negative based on reports of histopathologic analysis of surgical specimens. Two breast radiologists characterized all IDCs using the BI-RADS-US lexicon and specific ABUS features. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. A multinomial logistic regression model was built to predict the MSs from the imaging characteristics. BI-RADS-US descriptor margins and the retraction phenomenon are significantly associated with MSs (both p < 0.001) in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Posterior acoustic features and spiculation pattern severity were only significantly associated in univariate analysis (p < 0.001). Luminal A IDCs tend to have more prominent retraction patterns than luminal B IDCs. HER2-enriched and triple-negative IDCs present significantly less retraction than the luminal subtypes. The mean accuracy of MS prediction was 0.406. Overall, several BI-RADS-US descriptors and the coronal retraction phenomenon and spiculation pattern are associated with MSs, but prediction of MSs on ABUS is limited.},

Materials and Methods This prospective multicenter trial enrolled 296 carriers of the BRCA mutation (153 BRCA1 and 128 BRCA2 carriers, and 15 women with first-degree untested relatives) between September 2010 and November 2012, with follow-up until November 2015. Participants underwent 2 years of intensified surveillance including biannual AB US, and routine yearly DCE MR imaging and FFD mammography. The surveillance performance for each modality and possible combinations were determined. Results Breast cancer was screening-detected in 16 women (age range, 33-58 years). Three interval cancers were detected by self-examination, all in carriers of the BRCA1 mutation under age 43 years. One cancer was detected in a carrier of the BRCA1 mutation with a palpable abnormality in the contralateral breast. One incidental breast cancer was detected in a prophylactic mastectomy specimen. Respectively, sensitivity of DCE MR imaging, FFD mammography, and AB US was 68.1% (14 of 21; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 42.9%, 85.8%), 37.2% (eight of 21; 95% CI: 19.8%, 58.7%), and 32.1% (seven of 21; 95% CI: 16.1%, 53.8%); specificity was 95.0% (643 of 682; 95% CI: 92.7%, 96.5%), 98.1% (638 of 652; 95% CI: 96.7%, 98.9%), and 95.1% (1030 of 1088; 95% CI: 93.5%, 96.3%); cancer detection rate was 2.0% (14 of 702), 1.2% (eight of 671), and 1.0% (seven of 711) per 100 women-years; and positive predictive value was 25.2% (14 of 54), 33.7% (nine of 23), and 9.5% (seven of 68). DCE MR imaging and FFD mammography combined yielded the highest sensitivity of 76.3% (16 of 21; 95% CI: 53.8%, 89.9%) and specificity of 93.6% (643 of 691; 95% CI: 91.3%, 95.3%). AB US did not depict additional cancers. FFD mammography yielded no additional cancers in women younger than 43 years, the mean age at diagnosis. In carriers of the BRCA2 mutation, sensitivity of FFD mammography with DCE MR imaging surveillance was 90.9% (10 of 11; 95% CI: 72.7%, 100%) and 60.0% (six of 10; 95% CI: 30.0%, 90.0%) in carriers of the BRCA1 mutation because of the high interval cancer rate in carriers of the BRCA1 mutation. Conclusion AB US may not be of added value to yearly FFD mammography and DCE MR imaging surveillance of carriers of the BRCA mutation. Study results suggest that carriers of the BRCA mutation younger than 40 years may not benefit from FFD mammography surveillance in addition to DCE MR imaging.

  abstract = {Breast cancer screening using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has limited accessibility due to high costs of breast MRI. Ultrafast dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI can be acquired within 2 minutes. We aimed to assess whether screening performance of breast radiologist using an ultrafast breast MRI-only screening protocol is as good as performance using a full multiparametric diagnostic MRI protocol (FDP). The institutional review board approved this study, and waived the need for informed consent. Between January 2012 and June 2014, 1791 consecutive breast cancer screening examinations from 954 women with a lifetime risk of more than 20% were prospectively collected. All women were scanned using a 3 T protocol interleaving ultrafast breast MRI acquisitions in a full multiparametric diagnostic MRI protocol consisting of standard dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences, diffusion-weighted imaging, and T2-weighted imaging. Subsequently, a case set was created including all biopsied screen-detected lesions in this period (31 malignant and 54 benign) and 116 randomly selected normal cases with more than 2 years of follow-up. Prior examinations were included when available. Seven dedicated breast radiologists read all 201 examinations and 153 available priors once using the FDP and once using ultrafast breast MRI only in 2 counterbalanced and crossed-over reading sessions. For reading the FDP versus ultrafast breast MRI alone, sensitivity was 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.90) versus 0.84 (95% CI, 0.78-0.88) (P = 0.50), specificity was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.74-0.79) versus 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79-0.84) (P = 0.002), positive predictive value was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.36-0.45) versus 0.45 (95% CI, 0.41-0.50) (P = 0.14), and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82-0.96) versus 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82-0.96) (P = 0.83). Ultrafast breast MRI reading was 22.8% faster than reading FDP (P < 0.001). Interreader agreement is significantly better for ultrafast breast MRI (k = 0.730; 95% CI, 0.699-0.761) than for the FDP (k = 0.665; 95% CI, 0.633-0.696). Breast MRI screening using only an ultrafast breast MRI protocol is noninferior to screening with an FDP and may result in significantly higher screening specificity and shorter reading time.},

  abstract = {Automated breast (AB) ultrasonography (US) scanners have recently been brought to market for breast imaging. AB US devices use mechanically driven wide linear-array transducers that can image whole-breast US volumes in three dimensions. AB US is proposed for screening as a supplemental modality to mammography in women with dense breasts and overcomes important limitations of whole-breast US using handheld devices, such as operator dependence and limited reproducibility. A literature review of supplemental whole-breast US for screening was performed, which showed that both AB US and handheld US allow detection of mammographically negative early-stage invasive breast cancers but also increase the false-positive recall rate. Technicians with limited training can perform AB US; nevertheless, there is a learning curve for acquiring optimal images. Proper acquisition technique may allow avoidance of common artifacts that could impair interpretation of AB US results. Regardless, interpretation of AB US results can be challenging. This article reviews the US appearance of common benign and malignant lesions and presents examples of false-positive and false-negative AB US results. In situ breast cancers are rarely detected with supplemental whole-breast US. The most discriminating feature that separates AB US from handheld US is the retraction phenomenon on coronal reformatted images. The retraction phenomenon is rarely seen with benign findings but accompanies almost all breast cancers. In conclusion, women with dense breasts may benefit from supplemental AB US examinations. Understanding the pitfalls in acquisition technique and lesion interpretation, both of which can lead to false-positive recalls, might reduce the potential harm of performing supplemental AB US.

  abstract = {Background: Computer-aided detection software for automated breast ultrasound has been shown to have potential in improving the accuracy of radiologists. Alternative ways of implementing computer-aided detection, such as independent validation or preselecting suspicious cases, might also improve radiologists' accuracy.
                             Purpose: To investigate the effect of using computer-aided detection software to improve the performance of radiologists by validating findings reported by radiologists during screening with automated breast ultrasound. Material and Methods: Unilateral automated breast ultrasound exams were performed in 120 women with dense breasts that included 60 randomly selected normal exams, 30 exams with benign lesions, and 30 malignant cases (20 mammography-negative). Eight radiologists were instructed to detect breast cancer and rate lesions using BI-RADS and level-of-suspiciousness scores. Computer-aided detection software was used to check the validity of radiologists' findings. Findings found negative by computer-aided detection were not included in the readers' performance analysis; however, the nature of these findings were further analyzed. The area under the curve and the partial area under the curve for an interval in the range of 80%-100% specificity before and after validation of computer-aided detection were compared. Sensitivity was computed for all readers at a simulation of 90% specificity. Results: Partial AUC improved significantly from 0.126 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.098-0.153) to 0.142 (95% CI = 0.115-0.169) (P = 0.037) after computer-aided detection rejected mostly benign lesions and normal tissue scored BI-RADS 3 or 4. The full areas under the curve (0.823 vs. 0.833, respectively) were not significantly different (P = 0.743). Four cancers detected by readers were completely missed by computer-aided detection and four other cancers were detected by both readers and computer-aided detection but falsely rejected due to technical limitations of our implementation of computer-aided detection validation. In this study, validation of computer-aided detection discarded 42.6% of findings that were scored BI-RADS >=3 by the radiologists, of which 85.5% were non-malignant findings.Conclusion: Validation of radiologists' findings using computer-aided detection software for automated breast ultrasound has the potential to improve the performance of radiologists. Validation of computer-aided detection might be an efficient tool for double-reading strategies by limiting the amount of discordant cases needed to be double-read.},

  abstract = {Since its renaissance, deep learning has been widely used in various medical imaging tasks and has achieved remarkable success in many medical imaging applications, thereby propelling us into the so-called artificial intelligence (AI) era. It is known that the success of AI is mostly attributed to the availability of big data with annotations for a single task and the advances in high performance computing. However, medical imaging presents unique challenges that confront deep learning approaches. In this survey paper, we first highlight both clinical needs and technical challenges in medical imaging and describe how emerging trends in deep learning are addressing these issues. We cover the topics of network architecture, sparse and noisy labels, federating learning, interpretability, uncertainty quantification, etc. Then, we present several case studies that are commonly found in clinical practice, including digital pathology and chest, brain, cardiovascular, and abdominal imaging. Rather than presenting an exhaustive literature survey, we instead describe some prominent research highlights related to these case study applications. We conclude with a discussion and presentation of promising future directions.},

  abstract = {In patients with coronary artery stenoses of intermediate severity, the functional significance needs to be determined. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement, performed during invasive coronary angiography (ICA), is most often used in clinical practice. To reduce the number of ICA procedures, we present a method for automatic identification of patients with functionally significant coronary artery stenoses, employing deep learning analysis of the left ventricle (LV) myocardium in rest coronary CT angiography (CCTA). The study includes consecutively acquired CCTA scans of 166 patients who underwent invasive FFR measurements. To identify patients with a functionally significant coronary artery stenosis, analysis is performed in several stages. First, the LV myocardium is segmented using a multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN). To characterize the segmented LV myocardium, it is subsequently encoded using unsupervised convolutional autoencoder (CAE). As ischemic changes are expected to appear locally, the LV myocardium is divided into a number of spatially connected clusters, and statistics of the encodings are computed as features. Thereafter, patients are classified according to the presence of functionally significant stenosis using an SVM classifier based on the extracted features. Quantitative evaluation of LV myocardium segmentation in 20 images resulted in an average Dice coefficient of 0.91 and an average mean absolute distance between the segmented and reference LV boundaries of 0.7 mm. Twenty CCTA images were used to train the LV myocardium encoder. Classification of patients was evaluated in the remaining 126 CCTA scans in 50 10-fold cross-validation experiments and resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.74+-0.02. At sensitivity levels 0.60, 0.70 and 0.80, the corresponding specificity was 0.77, 0.71 and 0.59, respectively. The results demonstrate that automatic analysis of the LV myocardium in a single CCTA scan acquired at rest, without assessment of the anatomy of the coronary arteries, can be used to identify patients with functionally significant coronary artery stenosis. This might reduce the number of patients undergoing unnecessary invasive FFR measurements.},

  issue = {4},
  pages = {275--284},
  volume = {39},
  abstract = {Transmitted light microscopy is used in pathology to examine stained tissues. Digital image analysis is gaining importance as a means to quantify alterations in tissues. A prerequisite for accurate and reproducible quantification is the possibility to recognise stains in a standardised manner, independently of variations in the staining density. The usefulness of three colour models was studied using data from computer simulations and experimental data from an immuno-doublestained tissue section. Direct use of the three intensities obtained by a colour camera results in the red-green-blue (RGB) model. By decoupling the intensity from the RGB data, the hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) model is obtained. However, the major part of the variation in perceived intensities in transmitted light microscopy is caused by variations in staining density. Therefore, the hue-saturation-density (HSD) transform was defined as the RGB to HSI transform, applied to optical density values rather than intensities for the individual RGB channels. In the RGB model, the mixture of chromatic and intensity information hampers standardisation of stain recognition. In the HSI model, mixtures of stains that could be distinguished from other stains in the RGB model could not be separated. The HSD model enabled all possible distinctions in a two-dimensional, standardised data space. In the RGB model, standardised recognition is only possible by using complex and time-consuming algorithms. The HSI model is not suitable for stain recognition in transmitted light microscopy. The newly derived HSD model was found superior to the existing models for this purpose.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence developments are essential to the successful deployment of community-wide, MRI-driven prostate cancer diagnosis. AI systems should ensure that the main benefits of biopsy avoidance are delivered while maintaining consistent high specificities, at a range of disease prevalences. Since all current artificial intelligence / computer-aided detection systems for prostate cancer detection are experimental, multiple developmental efforts are still needed to bring the vision to fruition. Initial work needs to focus on developing systems as diagnostic supporting aids so their results can be integrated into the radiologists' workflow including gland and target outlining tasks for fusion biopsies. Developing AI systems as clinical decision-making tools will require greater efforts. The latter encompass larger multicentric, multivendor datasets where the different needs of patients stratified by diagnostic settings, disease prevalence, patient preference, and clinical setting are considered. AI-based, robust, standard operating procedures will increase the confidence of patients and payers, thus enabling the wider adoption of the MRI-directed approach for prostate cancer diagnosis. KEY POINTS: * AI systems need to ensure that the benefits of biopsy avoidance are delivered with consistent high specificities, at a range of disease prevalence. * Initial work has focused on developing systems as diagnostic supporting aids for outlining tasks, so they can be integrated into the radiologists' workflow to support MRI-directed biopsies. * Decision support tools require a larger body of work including multicentric, multivendor studies where the clinical needs, disease prevalence, patient preferences, and clinical setting are additionally defined.},

abstract = {In this work, we report the set-up and results of the Liver Tumor Segmentation Benchmark (LiTS), which was organized in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2017 and the International Conferences on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2017 and 2018. The image dataset is diverse and contains primary and secondary tumors with varied sizes and appearances with various lesion-to-background levels (hyper-/hypo-dense), created in collaboration with seven hospitals and research institutions. Seventy-five submitted liver and liver tumor segmentation algorithms were trained on a set of 131 computed tomography (CT) volumes and were tested on 70 unseen test images acquired from different patients. We found that not a single algorithm performed best for both liver and liver tumors in the three events. The best liver segmentation algorithm achieved a Dice score of 0.963, whereas, for tumor segmentation, the best algorithms achieved Dices scores of 0.674 (ISBI 2017), 0.702 (MICCAI 2017), and 0.739 (MICCAI 2018). Retrospectively, we performed additional analysis on liver tumor detection and revealed that not all top-performing segmentation algorithms worked well for tumor detection. The best liver tumor detection method achieved a lesion-wise recall of 0.458 (ISBI 2017), 0.515 (MICCAI 2017), and 0.554 (MICCAI 2018), indicating the need for further research. LiTS remains an active benchmark and resource for research, e.g., contributing the liver-related segmentation tasks in http://medicaldecathlon.com/. In addition, both data and online evaluation are accessible via www.lits-challenge.com.}
