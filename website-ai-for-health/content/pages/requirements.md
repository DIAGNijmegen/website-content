title: Requirements

For AI for Health MSc projects, students are eligible to receive a monthly reimbursement of â‚¬500,- for a period of six months. To receive the reimbursement, the project must take 6 months full-time or longer. The following requirements must be met during the course of the project:

- Each student is required to set up and maintain a [project webpage](https://www.ai-for-health.nl/student_projects/). The webpage should provide a clear overview of which people are involved in the project, what the project entails and what results have been achieved. Instructions for making a new project page can be found [here](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/website-content/blob/master/docs/create-a-new-aifh-project-page.md).

- Students must attend the [weekly meeting](https://www.ai-for-health.nl/meeting/) and are encouraged to actively participate in the discussion. 

- Each student will present during the weekly meeting in the first half of their project. This will give others a good overview of the project and any preliminary results. It is an excellent opportunity to receive valuable feedback and advice from other AI for Health members.

- Students are required to write a short intermediate report and attend an evaluation meeting to discuss project progress.

- Students are required to give a final defense presentation during the weekly meeting. They must plan this in advance and make sure all supervisors are in attendance to grade the project and presentation.

- At the end of the project, students must finalize their project webpage and include links to a GitHub repository containing the project code and any web application they have created. Students are encouraged to create a video that explains or demonstrates the final product of their project. A link to the final MSc thesis must also be included on the webpage.

**How to apply:**

- Send your CV with a list of grades and a short motivation letter to [aiforhealth@radboudumc.nl](mailto:aiforhealth@radboudumc.nl).

- Indicate for which project(s) you apply. You can also suggest other projects or modifications to a project.

- If you are not a student at Radboud University, explain your experience with deep learning or other techniques mentioned in the project proposal. Please also indicate any extra requirements your university may have, for example whether there must be an internal supervisor or there are requirements from your university regarding the thesis that needs to be written.
