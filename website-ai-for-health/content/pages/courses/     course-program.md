## What you need to know for the third edition of the course:

<ul>
  <li>The next edition of the course will start <b>11-02-2022</b>.</li>
<li>There are 2 tracks to choose from: </li>
<ul>
  <li> A <b>full track</b> that offers participants the ability to create their own AI solutions. In this track you will follow, besides the lectures, also practical sessions where you can pick up the skills needed to implement your own AI applications.</li>
  <li> A <b>light track</b> that does not involve programming and offers participants a good understanding of what AI is and how it can benefit your work.</li>
</ul>
</ul>  
## Full track program
<ul>
<li>The in depth course takes place on 17 Fridays.
<li>The course days consist of lectures in the morning and afternoon Python practicals with cases focused on Radboudumc practice.</li>
<li>The program will mostly be held at Radboudumc in Nijmegen and a few times at JADS in Den Bosch.</li>
<li>The course includes project days in the Radboudumc where you will work in a team on a Radboudumc project.</li>
<li>We expect participants to spend on average 2-3 hours per week on homework and self study.</li>
<li>There will be an online training environment with support documentation, discussion forum and blended learning.</li>
<li>The course will end with a graduation ceremony where teams will present their project results and a certificate will be awarded.</li>
</ul>
