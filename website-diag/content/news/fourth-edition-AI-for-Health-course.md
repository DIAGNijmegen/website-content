Applications for The fourth edition of the **AI for Health course**, starting on the 3rd of February 2023 are now open. Please apply before the **1st of December** to join the course.

The AI for Health program aims to advance AI innovations in healthcare, by providing an AI course for healthcare professionals, supporting MSc project and funding PhD research. Graduates of the course will receive an official certificate.

The course provides a great overview of the opportunities AI has for healthcare and offers hand-on experience with an actual AI project. These projects have already resulted in funded AI for Health MSc internships with over 20 departments of the Radboudumc and several successful grant applications.

Course topics cover the necessary ingredients for AI projects, such as understanding and preparing your data, choosing the right model, and evaluating and implementing your model in practice. Several areas of application will be covered by experts from the Radboudumc, such as medical imaging, analysing medical reports and genetics.

For the second time, we offer 2 tracks: the **full track**, which offers participants the opportunity to implement AI solutions themselves, and the **light track**, which offers participants an overview of the role AI can have in clinical practice, without any programming involved. 

Speakers in the course include amongst others:

Joran Lokkerbol, director of the Centre of Economic Evaluation & Machine Learning at Trimbos; Bram van Ginneken, Professor of Medical Image Analysis at Radboudumc; 
Marianne Boenink, Professor of Ethics of Healthcare at Radboudumc;
Sander Bervoets, Head of the RTC Bioinformatics at Radboudumc;
Egge van der Poel, Clinical Data Scientist at Erasmus MC;
Contributions from the RTC AI and RTC Data Stewardship.
