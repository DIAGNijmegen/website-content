Computational Pathology has shown the potential to signficantely enhance diagnostic and prognostics, however, the gap between the research lab and clinical practice has been challenging to overcome.
In a new review article, published in Nature Medicine, [member/jeroen-van-der-laak], [member/geert-litjens], and [member/francesco-ciompi] discuss the state-of-the-art, the implementation challenges
and potentially solutions to bridge this gap. You can find the paper [here](https://rdcu.be/ckDly).
