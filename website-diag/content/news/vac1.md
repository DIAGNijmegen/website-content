## Background
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers and the number of patients in the Netherlands is increasing from around 1500 per year in 2000 to around 2700 now. Pancreatic cancer is one of the few cancers for which survival rates have hardly improved over the past decades.

Recent results indicate that radiotherapy can be beneficial in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, the potential of conventional radiotherapy is limited because the pancreas may move during treatment and is surrounded by radiosensitive organs that should be spared as much as possible. A new development in radiotherapy is to use an [MR-linac](https://www.elekta.com/radiotherapy/treatment-delivery-systems/unity/). This is a [linear accelerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy) in which an MRI scanner is integrated. This allows for continuous MR imaging during treatment. The [Department of Radiation Oncology at Radboudumc](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/research/departments/radiation-oncology) has [recently installed](https://www.radboudumc.nl/nieuws/2020/installatie-van-de-mrlinac-in-het-radboudumc-begonnen) an Elekta Unity MR-linac and is optimizing the use of this machine for various radiotherapy treatments in a close research collaboration with [Elekta](https://www.elekta.com/). The ultimate goal of this research project is to optimally adjust the radiotherapy treatment in real-time, using deep learning analysis of the MR images and information from high-resolution CT scans that were acquired before the start of the treament and from the applied treatment so far. 

In the project you will focus on deep learning segmentation of the pancreas and surrounding organs and structures as well as the tumor. You will work with pre-treatment scans and MR-linac images from rapid sequences that allow real-time imaging and image analysis. The goal is to real-time track the motion of the tumor and organs, both on a time-scale of days, during the entire treatment cycle, and on a time-scale of minutes, during an individual treatment session. Based on the results of this analysis, the treatment can be optimized.

## Requirements
You should be a creative and enthusiastic researcher with an MSc degree in Computer Science, Physics, Engineering or Biomedical Sciences or similar, with a clear interest to develop image analysis algorithms and an affinity with medical topics. Experience with deep learning, machine learning, and image analysis is a plus. Good communication skills and expertise in software development, preferably in Python, are essential.

## Terms of employment
You will be appointed for four years as a PhD student with the standard salary and secondary conditions for PhD students in the Netherlands. The research should result in a PhD thesis.

## Organization
You will work at Radboudumc, in the Department of Radiation Oncology in a dedicated multi-disciplinary group of researchers that work on optimizing treatment with the MR-linac. Elekta has set up an international consortium of hospitals that work with the Unity MR-linac and share data and protocols to improve the potential of this novel way of performing radiotherapy. You will closely work with other researchers in this consortium. You will also be part of the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG). In DIAG, around 70 researchers develop deep learning algorithms to interpret and process medical images. Radboud University Medical Center and Radboud University are located in Nijmegen, the oldest Dutch city with a rich history and one of the liveliest city centers in the Netherlands. Radboud University has over 17,000 students. Radboud UMC is a leading academic center for medical science, education and health care with over 8,500 staff and 3,000 students.
