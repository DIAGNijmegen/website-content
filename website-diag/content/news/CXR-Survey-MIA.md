Recent advances in deep learning have led to a promising performance in chest X-ray analysis.
The release of multiple, large, publicly available chest X-ray datasets in recent years has encouraged research interest and boosted the number of publications.
In a new survey article, published in Medical Image Analysis,
[member/ecem-sogancioglu], [member/erdi-calli], [member/bram-van-ginneken], [member/kicky-van-leeuwen], [member/keelin-murphy] review 296 studies in deep learning for chest X-ray images. The authors discuss the current state of the art including caveats on the use of public datasets, the requirements of clinically useful systems, and gaps in the current literature.
