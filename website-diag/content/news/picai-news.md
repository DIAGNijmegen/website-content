With 10,000 carefully-curated patient exams, [the PI-CAI challenge](https://pi-cai.grand-challenge.org/) aims to develop and validate modern AI algorithms at clinically significant prostate cancer detection and diagnosis in MRI. Since the launch of the challenge in May 2022, over the past 7 months, there has been widespread engagement from AI developers and radiologists around the world. Notably, over 314 AI algorithm submissions have been made from developers across academia and industry (e.g. Siemens Healthineers, Avenda Health, Guerbet). Meanwhile, 79 radiologists (55 centers, 22 countries) have enlisted in the PI-CAI: Reader Study.

On 28 November 2022, key DIAG members of the PI-CAI consortium ([member/anindo-saha], [member/joeran-bosma], [Jasper J. Twilt](https://magicnijmegen.nl/people/jasper-twilt), [Maarten de Rooij](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/people/maarten-de-rooij), [member/henkjan-huisman]) concluded their oral presentation at RSNA 2022, and the results of all prostate-AI models as evaluated during the Open Development Phase of the PI-CAI challenge, are now [online](https://pi-cai.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/challenge/leaderboard/)! Furthermore, the study has been featured in the December 2022 issue of [RSIP Computer Vision News](https://www.rsipvision.com/ComputerVisionNews-2022December/48/) and the [RSNA 2022: Daily Bulletin](https://dailybulletin.rsna.org/db22/index.cfm?pg=22tue07).

Congratulations to the team for the great work and their presentation at RSNA 2022!
