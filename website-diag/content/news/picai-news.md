The December issue of Computer Vision News featured an [article](https://www.rsipvision.com/ComputerVisionNews-2022December/48/) about the PI-CAI challenge organized by a team at DIAG.

The PI-CAI Grand Challenge targets clinically significant prostate cancer detection and diagnosis in MRI.

The organizers [member/henkjan-huisman], [member/anindo-saha], [member/joeran-bosma], Maarten de Rooij and Jasper Twilt presented their work at RSNA22 speaking about the promising results obtained with AI. They aim to benchmark the state-of-the-art AI algorithms developed in the challenge against prostate radiologists at the end of the study.

Congratulations to the team for the great work and their presentation at RSNA22!
