Last month, Computational pathology group-members [Francesco Ciompi](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/members/francesco-ciompi/) and [Jeroen van der Laak](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/members/jeroen-van-der-laak/) have been awarded 2 grants for performing cancer research based on deep learning techniques. Supported by funding of the [European Unionâ€™s ICT12 H2020 program](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/), Jeroen and Francesco will work together with a consortium of European partners on the [EXAMODE project](https://www.examode.eu/). The goal of this project is to build tools based on artificial intelligence to aid pathologists in routine diagnostics via automatic analysis of digital pathology whole-slide images of cancer specimens across multiple organs. The second project (PROACTING) is in collaboration with the [NKI](https://www.nki.nl/) in Amsterdam and funded by the [Dutch Cancer Society](https://www.kwf.nl/onderzoek/subsidie-informatie/Pages/default.aspx) as part of the 'Onderzoek & Implementatie' program. With PROACTING, Jeroen and Francesco aim together with [Jelle Wesseling](https://www.nki.nl/divisions/molecular-pathology/wesseling-j-group/) and [Esther Lips](https://www.nki.nl/people/lips-esther) to predict the response to neo-adjuvant treatment of breast cancer patients.
