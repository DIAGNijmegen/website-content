The [Academic Alliance]( https://www.mumc.nl/actueel/nieuws/de-academische-alliantie-zorghart-voor-zuidoost-nederland) between [Maastricht MUMC+]( https://www.mumc.nl/) and [Radboudumc]( https://www.radboudumc.nl/patientenzorg) supports strong collaboration in various areas of patient care, education, and research. The Academic Alliance Fund is designed to stimulate innovation and science within the academic alliance of the two centers. 

During the awarded project, [member/geert-litjens], [member/daan-geijs], [Avital Amir]( https://www.radboudumc.nl/afdelingen/pathologie/team-pathologie) ([CPG]( https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/) and Radboudumc), [Lisa Hillen]( https://pathologie.mumc.nl/nl/medewerkers/hillen), [Veronique Winnepenninckx]( https://pathologie.mumc.nl/specialisten/winnepenninckx-phd) and [Nicole Kelleners]( https://www.mumc.nl/en/node/7085) (MUMC+) aim to improve Mohs surgery with artificial intelligence (AI). Mohs surgery is a precise surgical technique used to treat skin cancer. During Mohs surgery, thin layers of cancer-containing skin are progressively removed and microscopically examined until only cancer-free tissue remains. In the proposed project, a basal cell carcinoma detection algorithm will be adapted to assist the dermatologist with determining if surgical edges are free of cancer. The algorithm will be made available through an app, and a customized smartphone holder will enable users to assess the microscopic images through the camera of their phone. The technique will be validated during a prospective clinical trial in Radboudumc and MUMC+, which will be extended to other peripheral centers.
