[RSNA News](https://www.rsna.org/en/news/2020/July/AI-COVID-Research) interviewed [member/keelin-murphy] in an article that describes how on AI models help in detecting, monitoring, and interpreting data on COVID-19. [member/keelin-murphy] published her [validation study in Radiology](/publications/murp20a/) of the [CAD4COVID-XRay solution developed by Thirona](https://thirona.eu/cad4covid/). 

The research is now continued in the [Mistral project](https://www.swisstph.ch/fr/projects/project-detail/project/mitigation-strategies-for-communities-with-covid-19-transmission-in-lesotho-using-artificial-intelli/) where DIAG will develop new AI algorithms that analyze both chest radiographs and blood markers to identify COVID-19. This new tool will be combined with [CAD4TB](https://www.delft.care/cad4tb/) to screen simultaneously for COVID-19 and TB in two hospitals in Lesotho. Mistral will run for two years and [member/keelin-murphy] will be the lead researcher from DIAG.
