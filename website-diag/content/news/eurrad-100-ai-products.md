The market of artificial intelligence (AI) software for radiology keeps growing. However, it is difficult to maintain oversight of all regulatory cleared products. Therefore, PhD candidate [member/kicky-van-leeuwen] with help from her team developed the platform [www.AIforRadiology.com](https://AIforRadiology.com) with a listing of CE marked AI products for radiology. This has been accompanied by a recently published paper in European Radiology in which 100 of these products were closely evaluated. The authors found that only 36 out of the 100 products had peer-reviewed evidence on the efficacy of the software. Even less, only 18, had studies demonstrating the clinical impact. Though the number of available products is large (+160 products by now), the evidence of its clinical value remains thin.
