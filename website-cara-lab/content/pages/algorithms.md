title: Algorithms

## Cara Lab algorithms

At CARA Lab, we focus on developing advanced AI-driven methods for intracoronary imaging analysis. Our research aims to improve segmentation, artifact detection, and the identification of rare structures such as thrombus or plaque rupture. Additionally, we work on models for stent detection and characterization. Currently, our published and available models include segmentation and artifact detection algorithms.

## Segmentation

Our segmentation model, [OCT-AID](https://academic.oup.com/ehjdh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ehjdh/ztaf021/8078941), is led by [member/ruben-van-der-waerden] and is designed to precisely delineate key structures within intracoronary OCT images, aiding in the identification of vessel boundaries, plaque types, and other relevant features. By leveraging deep learning techniques, our model enhances automated interpretation and assists clinicians in decision-making.

We demonstrated previously, in the PECTUS-AI study led by [member/rick-volleberg] and [member/thijs-luttikholt], that OCT-AID can automatically detect high-risk plaques and predict adverse clinical outcomes more accurately than manual expert assessment. These findings highlight the potential of AI to transform intracoronary imaging into a powerful, clinically actionable tool for risk stratification.

## Artifact Detection

Our [artifact detection algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05322), led by [member/pierandrea-cancian] focuses on identifying attenuation artifacts within OCT recordings. It employs an A-line-based approach to distinguish between valid imaging data and regions affected by signal loss due to blood and gas bubbles, ensuring more accurate assessments of vessel structures and pathology.
