## Cara Lab algorithms

At CARA Lab, we focus on developing advanced AI-driven methods for intracoronary imaging analysis. Our research aims to improve segmentation, artifact detection, and the identification of rare structures such as thrombus or plaque rupture. Additionally, we work on models for stent detection and characterization. Currently, our published and available models include segmentation and artifact detection algorithms.

## Segmentation

Our segmentation model, OCT-AID, is designed to precisely delineate key structures within intracoronary OCT images, aiding in the identification of vessel boundaries, plaques, and other relevant features. By leveraging deep learning techniques, our model enhances automated interpretation and assists clinicians in decision-making.

## Artifact Detection

Our artifact detection algorithm focuses on identifying attenuation artifacts within OCT scans. It employs an A-line-based approach to distinguish between valid imaging data and regions affected by signal loss, ensuring more accurate assessments of vessel structures and pathology.
