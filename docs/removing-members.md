# Removing members who left

1. **Do not delete the member page**
2. Instead, change the "active" field in the member page, e.g., ```website-content/content/pages/members/bram-van-ginneken.md``` to "no"
3. Add the person with a link to their LinkedIn page to the former employees list of the respective websites, e.g., ```website-diag/content/pages/former-employees.md```
