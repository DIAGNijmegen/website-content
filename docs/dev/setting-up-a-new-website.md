# Setting up a new website

This file describes the steps to set up a new website.

## 1. Setting up the repository

1. Create a new repository for the website at `DIAGNijmegen/website-{website name}`.
2. Make sure that `DIAGWebTeam` user has write access to this repository; this can be done by adding this user as a collaborator.

## 2. Configure the domain

1. Check with the group which domain name they want to use, e.g. `{group}.diagnijmegen.nl` or `www.{group}.nl`.
2. Setup the DNS records, see https://help.github.com/en/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain

## 3. Create a new website directory

1. In the `website-content` repository, copy the contents of `website-base` to a new directory with the same name as the new repositiory (e.g. `website-{website name}`).
2. Update `pelicanconf.py` if needed, e.g. change the name of the website. 
3. Update `publishconf.py`, set `SITEURL` to the correct value (the URL where the website should be accessible).

## 4. Create a new deploy step

1. Update `parse_content.py` (in the root directory) by adding the new site, see https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/website-content/blob/master/parse_content.py#L6
2. Update `travis.yaml` and add a new deploy step at the bottom. See the other deploy steps for an example. Set the `fqdn` variable to the website URL.
3. Update build.sh and add new website to websites to build: declare -a websites= 

## 5. Publish

1. Commit your changes, Travis should now build and deploy the website.
2. Edit manual the github pages option from "None" to "Master branch" in the settings page of the github repository of the new website
