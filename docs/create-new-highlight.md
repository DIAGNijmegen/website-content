# Create new highlight

1. Create new file in website-content/content/pages/highlights/
2. Type name of page in empty entry on top and end with .md. Example: ```website-content/content/pages/highlights/new-highlight.md```
3. Fill with the following:
```
title: Title of highlight
date: YYYY-MM-DD
picture: news/<image>.png (Image is collected from website-content/content/images/news/. Images should be landscape (preferably with aspect ratio 16:9) and min 768px wide)
groups: diag/retina/pathology, etc. This determines on which website the highlight will appear. Groups are divided by commas.

{Text Highlight}
* Write the text in the thirth person
* Add links where possible:
external links: [Text](link)
internal links: [member/firstname-lastname] 
```
4. To add an image to the text, upload an image of choice to website-content/content/images/news/ and type `![name of image link]({{ IMGURL }}/images/news/<image>.png)`. The first `{{ IMGURL }}` is text, don't type the actual filename there. `IMGURL` makes sure the image is always loaded from the correct domain (in case of using a CDN).

5. Commit changes at bottom of the page to submit.

## Adding a draft news item

If you want to create a draft of your post, you can add the following tag to the file:

```
status: draft
```

Drafts do not show up on the homepage, nor on the news overview. Instead, drafts can be viewed directly through `<site url>/drafts/file-name`. To publish the draft, remove the `status` tag.
