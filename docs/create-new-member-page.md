```

## Guidelines

* Check the other people pages to see what a bio text looks like. Write in the same style.
* Make sure you mention the project you work on as a link.
* Make sure you mention who supervises you, and make this a link, with "[member/bram-van-ginneken]" you create a link to a people page. You can make links by putting the link text between square brackets [ and ] immediately followed by the url between normal parentheses, ( and ). You can refer to publications with "/publications/kars92" as the url text.
* Do not write a title like Prof. or Professor or Dr. before the name of a colleague.
